Ive been looking in Micromark for files to work on mouthpices.  In 
needle files I found sets of Swiss Pattern needle sets, Coarse Files, 
also Carbide and diamond files in 80 and 120.  So which ones do I 
want?  Im primarily going to be working on hard rubber.  Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>The 7" long coarse files (Micromark 60526) are good for HR.  I also like
the mid sized set (81063).  They have a little finer cut.  Its shown with
blue rubber handles but they always come with red handles.  I&#39;m on my 3rd
set of them.

Both are decent on brass but dull quickly on harder metals.   I&#39;m starting
to use harder Valtitan needle files on the harder materials.  These files
are pricy and a little on the thin side for general work.

Thanks Keith, I will get both as they are pretty cheap.  The numbers 
were very helpful too!
