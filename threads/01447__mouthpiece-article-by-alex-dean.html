            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve finally managed to post a PDF file of an article by Alex Dean 
from this month&#39;s issue of Canadian Musician magazine.

The file is in the "Misc. Other Files" area. It&#39;s about 245k in size.

The article has been uploaded with Alex&#39;s permission. It mentions 
this group in the last paragraph.
