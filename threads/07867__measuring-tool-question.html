            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, all, 

I work mostly on Bb clarinet mouthpieces and barrels. I need to inquire what is the best precision tool members have found for measuring the inside diameter and dimensions of mouthpieces/barrel bores. I have a plug guage, but it only measures the exit diameter. I want to be able to take measurements at various locations along the bore and inside of mouthpieces/barrels.

Thanks,

Joseph Lopez

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a set of T-shaped telescopic bore gauges.  I got a used set from eBay.  They spring open inside the bore, then you lock them.  You pull it out and measure the length with a set of calipers.

A proper bore guage with dial indicator is much easier to use and more precise than the telescopic type guage.
In addition by slowly moving guage along the bore of the barrel or mouthpiece it is relatively easy to asess the overall shape and rate of change in the bore.
I have 2 different variations
1. is operated by spring loaded handle and can reach about 3" into the bore so works very well with mouthpieces and barrels.
2. Has a long extension arm and can reach much further down into the bore and so is well suited to measuring the bores of upper and lower joints but of course works equally with shorter sections.
