            <pre class='message__body'>I have a student (very good player) with an older Yamaha 62 tenor and 
he is searching for a mouthpiece. What seems to work well with this 
type of horn. He is not partial to metal or rubber so any and all 
suggestions are fine. Currently he is playing on an old HR NY 
Meyer .095 facing 6M. Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>There&#39;s nothing wrong with what he has!  Those are really nice pieces.

If he wants something different, the standard answers are rubber link or metal link.  Both work well on the 62&#39;s.  Personally, I would recommend something like a Morgan, Tenney, Barone, or RPC if he wants to get something hand faced.  The Morgan L&#39;s are really nice alternatives to rubber links.

            <pre class='message__body'>For general playing, jazz band, combo, commercial music, for a student I highly
recommend the Runyon Custom Spoiler #7 (.090" / 2.3 mm) for younger students (high
school thru college) or #8 (.098" / 2.5 mm) for more seasoned players.  The spoiler
insert may be placed in the chamber or removed to suit the music being played. 
This mouthpiece has a big band, theatre, combo type tone, neither too bright nor
too dark.  This is a good starting point, and quite playable while he tries other
mouthpieces looking for "his sound".  Beyond this, I would have to know what type
of music he wants to play.  Paul

            <pre class='message__body'>What doesn&#39;t he like about his Meyer, and what style(s) will he be
using this new mouthpiece to play?  If he has the patience to find a
good one, a Berg should work very nicely for most jazz and commercial
playing, and there are lots of baffle and facing options for different
sounds.  I prefer the feel of the metal version, but I don&#39;t recall
metal Bergs sounding any different from rubber ones.  Hope that helps.
