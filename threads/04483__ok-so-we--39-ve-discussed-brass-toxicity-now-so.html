            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone set up their own silver electroplating facility at home 
using something like:

http://homepages.tesco.net/~jeep/silvrcot.htm 
with a stainless steel anode and a couple of batteries?

If so, could they publish their experiences here? (for instance, 
surface preparation, etch with ferric chloride? how long, etc). 

How good a result can you get with this diy approach?

Thanks,
John Ricketts

            <pre class='message__body'>I haven&#39;t seen any response to this and with all the

into the battery thing.

Any thoughts on this product or something other that&#39;s
similar and available on the west side of the pond?

Brush plating requires current too.  Usually from a DC power supply.  The
plating is very thin and for me a little frustrating for the time put in. 
I need to get time to play with the voltage to get optimal results.
