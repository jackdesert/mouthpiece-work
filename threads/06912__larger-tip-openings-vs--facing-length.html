            <pre class='message__body'>hi everyone
i just got a jodyjazz 9M alto mpc to try since its a little bigger than my RPC that im currently using. 

the facing on my RPC (tip .90) is around 19mm long while the jodyjazz 9M (tip .100) is around 24mm which is almost as long as my jody tenor mouthpiece (tip .105, 25mm long). 

i was wondering if this is right, to have a facing length on alto that is as long as a tenor facing.  and, does it have to be this way because the tip is so large?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have only seen a few RPC tenors and baris.  They had medium-long facing lengths.  The 38 = 19mm facing length for the RPC alto looks a little short to me for a .090".  
 
There are very few mouthpieces out there with tips that measure over .095".  Alto facing lengths mostly max out at 46 = 23 mm unless there is a problem with them like a convex table.   If they are longer, the reed will not bend and air will leak out the sides.  Some reed cuts might work at 48 and some might leak at 46.

The Jody Jazz mouthpieces are deliberately lengthened, but not because of tip opening, but for other playing characteristics.  The curve is not a pure radial curve.
