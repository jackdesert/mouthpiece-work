            <pre class='message__body'>I have been studying the excel mouthpiece volume data spreadsheet
created by Keith that he share with me some time ago.  From these

This discrepancy suggests that:

1) The acoustician&#39;s pronouncement that the mouthpiece must closely
match the volume of the missing cone in order for the saxophone to play
properly in tune, and in tune with itself is not accurate in the real

2) The method to extrapolate the length and volume of the missing cone
from the end of the neck given by Ferron is inaccurate in that the

My idea at this point would be to take some of the measurements of
mouthpiece volume Keith has done, add an appropriate amount to get the
"equivalent volume", and then work backwards from there to determine the
relationship of that volume to the body tube and/or neck of the

interpret the physical measurements of the body and/or neck to estimate
the missing cone volume known to produce the correct intonation and

It is my belief that this information would be immensely useful to
mouthpiece making and adjustment, in that an accurate way to determine
the volume needed for any given model of saxophone to compliment its
truncated cone would allow makers and refacers to match a mouthpieces
length and chamber volume to any new or vintage saxophone.

            <pre class='message__body'>Your point is well taken Toby about the minutiae of the variables,
however it is still entirely possible to accurately measure the interior
volume of a mouthpiece past the neck when the intonation and harmonics
of the saxophone are in the best possible alignment once the saxophone
is properly warmed up.   It is also possible to get a good estimate of
the total  "equivalent volume" of the mouthpiece by employing the
technique used by Benade and Gebler FMA p. 466.

The length and volume of the cone required to complete the truncated
neck can be also be calculated as well as the truncated body tube
measured from the where the bow attaches to the body tube.  By comparing
these measurements and calculations to the actual missing cone volume
provided by the mouthpiece on several sizes and makes of saxophones,
there is a possibility  that a pattern of relationships will emerge that
will point to the ways to convert the geometric measurements of the
truncated tube to the "acoustic measurements" that determine the missing
cone volume needed.

My idea at this point would be to take some of the measurements of
mouthpiece volume Keith has done, add an appropriate amount to get the
"equivalent volume", and then work backwards from there to determine the
relationship of that volume to the body tube and/or neck of the saxophone.
From there  the challenge would be to find a way to interpret the physical
measurements of the body and/or neck to estimate the missing cone volume

It is my belief that this information would be immensely useful to
mouthpiece making and adjustment, in that an accurate way to determine the
volume needed for any given model of saxophone to compliment its truncated
cone would allow makers and refacers to match a mouthpieces length and
chamber volume to any new or vintage saxophone.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, that&#39;s true. It is entirely possible that after a number of measurements you will find a statistical trend that will indicate a relationship between what you measure as the missing cone and what you measure as the mpc volume that will tend to give optimum intonation. It will be interesting to
 see if there is a close correlation across the board, or whether different saxes "want" different mpc volumes for best intonation,

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, what I would like to see is an exploration of length to the tip of the reed. It is always possible to adjust mpc volume by moving the mpc on the cork, but there is also a tuning effect depending on the length. From what I get from Benade, and my own experiences in adjusting chambers, not
 all "volumes" are created equal; it is a combination of both the mpc volume and the length of the bore which determines the mode relationships (you can read the Benade section on oboe reeds in his 1977 paper).

            <pre class='message__body'>John,
   
  Considering further, here is an little experiment that might give you a baseline for further exploration:
   
  Use the same horn and hopefully the same reed, and try several (or many) different mpcs, measuring the volume of each at the point it produces good intonation. Obviously different facings are going to change the volume and some of the reed characteristcis slightly, but this should definitely
 indicate the range of volumes which give optimum intonation with different mpcs. I am guessing that the "optimum" volume is going to vary somewhat depending on the mpc design.
   
  Another interesting test would be to have a number of different players use the same setup and adjust the mpc for optimum intonation. Based on embouchure and blowing characteristics, the optimum volume may well vary significantly from player to player.
   
  Some rough answers to those two questions will give you a more solid baseline from which to perform your volume investigations, as the "ideal-missing-cone-volume" is a fixed property in those cases, the horn (and hopefully the temperature) being the same.

 chambers, not all "volumes" are created equal; it is a combination of both the mpc volume and the length of the bore which determines the mode relationships (you can read the Benade section on oboe reeds in his 1977 paper).

        Your point is well taken Toby about the minutiae of the variables,
however it is still entirely possible to accurately measure the interior
volume of a mouthpiece past the neck when the intonation and harmonics
of the saxophone are in the best possible alignment once the saxophone
is properly warmed up. It is also possible to get a good estimate of
the total "equivalent volume" of the mouthpiece by employing the
technique used by Benade and Gebler FMA p. 466.

The length and volume of the cone required to complete the truncated
neck can be also be calculated as well as the truncated body tube
measured from the where the bow attaches to the body tube. By comparing
these measurements and calculations to the actual missing cone volume
provided by the mouthpiece on several sizes and makes of saxophones,
there is a possibility that a pattern of relationships will emerge that
will point to the ways to convert the geometric measurements of the
truncated tube to the "acoustic measurements" that determine the missing
cone volume needed.

First, thanks for passing on that reply from Joe Wolfe. In terms of the Benade quote, he says (on pgs 25- 26):

"(A) Suppose the D4-D5 octave is OK, but the scale runs flat in going up from D4 to C5 (i.e., the low-register scale runs short with an extra big jump between C5 and the D5 that is the bottom note of the second register. If everything sings as described earlier, then try to renegotiate with a narrower staple and/or a narrower reed--but you must be aware of the tuning checks given below, so as not to get into a bind! (Shorter should somewhat do the job too, but save it for what it does best--see below.)

(B) Suppose the D4-D5 octave is OK, more or less, but the whole scale seems a trifle flat from what you want it to be. THIS IS A DANGEROUS GAME IF YOU DON&#39;T KNOW FOR A FACT WHAT PITCH THE INSTRUMENT WAS DESIGNED FOR !

Provided the instrument pretty well sings with the reed you have and provided the scale runs a trifle short in the manner indicated in step A , the cure is to use a slightly SHORTER stape and/or reed--a narrower one of each will stretch the scale rather than raise it en masse. THIS SEEMS OBVIOUS--IT IS NOT, HOWEVER. It is a special quirk of a cone of variable length provided at the top with a cavity--somewhat elongated--and a constriction.

As little as 3 mm shortening will raise the overall playing pitch of essentially the whole scale by 15 to 20 cents on an oboe if the cooperations are in reasonably good order.

THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR THE FLUTE (conical bore or cylindrical bore) OR THE CLARINET.

(C) If you have to raise the pitch as in step B or stretch the scale as in A, the cooperations may have been upset, and you have to go through the whole business outlined in the previous parts of this section on the oboe.

ACTUALLY, ONE KEEPS ALL OF THIS MATERIAL IN MIND AT THE SAME TIME WHILE NEGOTIATIONG THE PROPER PROPORTIONS FOR REED AND STAPLE.

EVERYTHING IN THESE NOTES TRANSLATE WITHOUT ESSENTIAL CHANGE FOR THE BASSOON;

WITH ONLY A LITTLE CHANGE IT ADAPTS THINGS TO THE SAXOPHONE;

AND IT IS NO GOOD AT ALL FOR FLUTE OR CLARINET."

This indicates pretty clearly to me that length plays a role as well as volume, since the volume inside the reed, which is changed if you narrow or shorten the reed, is analogous to the volume inside the sax mpc. However shortening the reed raises all modes more or less equally, whereas narrowing it stretches them. It&#39;s alse interesting to read all the stuff about adjusting the reed/staple before he gets to that part.

            <pre class='message__body'>If I understand you correctly, you are saying that Benade&#39;s statement
that making the reed or staple shorter on the oboe will raise the pitch
of all of the notes an equal amount AND that making the reed shorter is
the equivalent of pushing a sax mouthpiece further onto the cork. 
Obviously making the neck of the saxophone shorter would not be a
practical way to change the pitch.

Then you are claiming that using a narrower reed or staple which has the
same length to the tip but less volume will stretch the scale making the
higher tones go sharp.  The equivalent of this on saxophone would be to
leave the mouthpiece in the same place on the neck, but give the
interior of the mouthpiece less volume with an insert or interior
coating, etc.  This in turn would sharpen lower notes some, but the
higher notes more "stretching" the scale.

I think I finally get the analogy.  It would be simple to check using my
mouthpiece inserts.  The first step would be  to warm up the saxophone
and mark the spot on the neck where the mouthpiece plays well in tune in
both registers.  Then put the mouthpiece onto the cork 1/4" and check
the pitches of a 2 octave scale to see if they all go sharp by close to
the same amount.
The last step would be to put the mouthpiece back to the original
position and put the 1/4" insert into the shank of the mouthpiece.

If your theory is correct with the insert (narrower reed) the lower
notes of the scale then would go sharp to the same degree as pushing the
mouthpiece in 1/4", but as one plays up the scale into the second
octave, the pitch should go even sharper.  I will do this test and
record the results.  This would also be an excellent test for the
artificial embouchure when I get it up and running.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,

Yes, that seems to be the way it should work on sax if I understand Benade correctly. It is also worth reading the earlier part on the oboe leading up to that, to see how Benade approaches fitting the reed to the oboe.

Of course oboe reeds are not a direct analogy to a sax mpc, because the staple is analogous to the neck. There is another thing at work in oboe reeds, and I don&#39;t know how it translates: the interior volume of the reed is nowhere near as large as the missing cone, but apparently the reed
 compliance is enough to lower the pitch to correct intonation, although by volume alone the upper modes should be quite sharp.

It&#39;s a shame Dr. Benade is not still around so that we could ask him. He apparently did quite a bit of sax mpc experimentation in his time.

Then you are claiming that using a narrower reed or staple which has the same length to the tip but less volume will stretch the scale making the higher tones go sharp.  The equivalent of this on saxophone would be to leave the mouthpiece in the same place on the neck, but give the interior of the
 mouthpiece less volume with an insert or interior coating, etc.  This in turn would sharpen lower notes some, but the higher notes more "stretching" the scale.

I think I finally get the analogy.  It would be simple to check using my mouthpiece inserts.  The first step would be  to warm up the saxophone and mark the spot on the neck where the mouthpiece plays well in tune in both registers.  Then put the mouthpiece onto the cork 1/4" and check the pitches
 of a 2 octave scale to see if they all go sharp by close to the same amount.
The last step would be to put the mouthpiece back to the original position and put the 1/4" insert into the shank of the mouthpiece.

If your theory is correct with the insert (narrower reed) the lower notes of the scale then would go sharp to the same degree as pushing the mouthpiece in 1/4", but as one plays up the scale into the second octave, the pitch should go even sharper.  I will do this test and record the results. 
 This would also be an excellent test for the artificial embouchure when I get it up and running.

If there were a difference, would you calculate the truncation ratio based upon the main body taper or the neck taper?

 Changing mpc position does not alter the truncation ratio.

 Keep in mind that changing the MP position also  changes the volume and, also,

        If I understand you correctly, you are saying that Benade&#39;s statement that    making the reed or staple shorter on the oboe will raise the pitch of    all of the notes an equal amount AND that making the reed shorter is the     equivalent of pushing a sax mouthpiece further onto the cork. 
 Obviously    making the neck of the saxophone shorter would not be a practical way to    change the pitch.
 
 Then you are claiming that using a narrower reed    or staple which has the same length to the tip but less volume will    stretch the scale making the higher tones go sharp.  The equivalent of    this on saxophone would be to leave the mouthpiece in the same place on the    neck, but  give the
 interior of the mouthpiece less volume with an insert or    interior coating, etc.  This in turn would sharpen lower notes some, but    the higher notes more "stretching" the scale.
 
 I think I finally get the    analogy.  It would be simple to check using my mouthpiece inserts.     The first step would be  to warm up the saxophone and mark the spot on    the neck where the mouthpiece plays well in tune in both registers.  Then    put the mouthpiece onto the  cork 1/4" and
 check the pitches of a 2 octave    scale to see if they all go sharp by close to the same amount.
 The last    step would be to put the mouthpiece back to the original position and put the    1/4" insert into the shank of the mouthpiece.
 
 If your theory is correct    with the insert (narrower reed) the lower notes of the scale then would go    sharp to the same degree as pushing the mouthpiece in 1/4", but as one plays    up the scale into the second octave, the pitch should go even sharper.  I    will do this test and record  the
 results.  This would also be an    excellent test for the artificial embouchure when I get it up and    running.

I believe it is important to remember that in actuality the truncation of the cone occurs at the top of the neck in order to provide a source to generate the soundwave.  The only time the truncation occurs elsewhere is to make the saxophone fit into its case.

The neck in spite of its gentle curve, short cylinder attached to its bottom, and small octave vent perturbation is much closer to an ideal cone than is the body section of the saxophone with its extensive "lattice" of closed tone holes.

Acoustically speaking, the flare of the body cone should be greater than its measured slope because the sound wave passes more and more of these closed tone holes as it moves to the bow of the sax---each tonehole representing a larger bore to the sound wave along the way.

It is my thinking then that to use the geometric physical dimensions of the body tube to determine the length or volume of the missing cone will produce much more inaccurate results than using the dimensions of the neck which are closer to the ideal cone.  Your mileage may vary.

I believe it is important to remember that in actuality the truncation of
the cone occurs at the top of the neck in order to provide a source to
generate the soundwave. The only time the truncation occurs elsewhere is to
make the saxophone fit into its case.

The neck in spite of its gentle curve, short cylinder attached to its
bottom, and small octave vent perturbation is much closer to an ideal cone
than is the body section of the saxophone with its extensive "lattice" of
closed tone holes.

Acoustically speaking, the flare of the body cone should be greater than its
measured slope because the sound wave passes more and more of these closed
tone holes as it moves to the bow of the sax---each tonehole representing a
larger bore to the sound wave along the way.

It is my thinking then that to use the geometric physical dimensions of the
body tube to determine the length or volume of the missing cone will produce
much more inaccurate results than using the dimensions of the neck which are
closer to the ideal cone. Your mileage may vary.

John,

I understand your thinking and it seems reasonable, however, there are a few important things that your explanation does not take into account, which I believe it should, to be sound (no pun intended):

1. With the exception of the duplicated tone holes (side C, side Bb, Chromatic F#),  the inaccuracies induced by the closed tone holes are compensated for by way of tone hole placement/size - adjusting the length of the tube - in order to provide an accurate low octave (lower frequency) scale.  

2. All of the tone holes and all of the notes emanate from the body of the saxophone.  Not one tone emanates from the neck.   A good low octave scale can be achieved via #1 regardless of the neck taper.

3. All acoustical publications describe the substitution volume requirement as mainly a prerequisite for LOWER FREQUENCY accuracy and response.

4. All acoustical publications describe the modified neck taper, or similar upper body taper (oboes) as an adjustment to the main body taper to insure alignment of HIGHER FREQUENCIES.

5. The Frs, mouthpice on it&#39;s neck playing frequency adjustment is responsible for higher frequency alignment. 

6.  Nederveen diagrams clearly and describes the difference between the missing cone based upon the body taper and that of the neck (or modified upper body) taper, and their acoustical effects in his book.  I won&#39;t give you the page, as, if you have the book you should know it, and if you don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t matter.

What Nederveen says, and what #1-#5 indicate, is that low frequency requirements remain low frequency requirements, and higher frequency requirements the same.  To be correct, the missing cone volume, which insures lower frequency accuracy and response, must be determined by the tube which generates the low frequency octave tones - the main body tube.

            <pre class='message__body'>But, for example, take a modern soprano, which has a much wider cone section at the top of the tube that makes a rather abrupt transition to the main cone of the body. It is only a minor fraction of the full tube length. Would you use that as your cone to calculate the missing volume? I don&#39;t
 think so. OTOH you are quite right that the main body of the sax is essentially a wider cone than it appears because of the extra compliance of the tone holes.

There are mathematical ways of calculating the effects of the cavities of closed tone holes, but it is a major pain, from what I have seen.Still, since every sax has basically the same tone holes, it might be possible to get a figure for the effective change in cone due to tone holes that would
 apply to all saxes.

So what have we got? A non-ideal cone with extra compliances, which must be tweaked in order to pull the modes into line. One place where it is tweaked is in the neck curve, and at the very end of the neck. Therefore, while the neck might be close to conical, it does not have the effective angle
 of the full tube, I think. 

And really, where does all this get us? The mpc is moved according to the ambient temperature and the reed compliance changes the modes, not to mention embouchure effects. At best, the ideal mpc volume, like the ideal cone, is a theoretical fiction, subject to the vagaries of the real world. I
 think that "close enough for jazz" really applies here.

John, the truncation ratio is a measure of the length of the missing segment compared to the length of the full cone. Every time you open a tone hole, effectively shortening the tube, you change the truncation ratio. Mode relationships in a truncated cone depend on the ratio of the diameters of
 the two ends. The neck diameter is fixed, but the end diameter will depend on how much of the tube is in play. Actually these two concepts are just two ways of saying the same thing..

            <pre class='message__body'>Let&#39;s just cut to the chase in this discussion and save some time. 
These two paragraphs seem to summarize the argument presented in the
previous post on the question of whether the body tube or neck should be
used to calculate the volume (length) of the missing cone.

6.  Nederveen diagrams clearly and describes the difference between the
missing cone based upon the body taper and that of the neck (or modified
upper body) taper, and their acoustical effects in his book.  I won&#39;t
give you the page, as, if you have the book you should know it, and if
you don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t matter.

Come on Lance.  If you are going to pull Nederveen out of your holster
in this shootout, you have got to do better than that.  Nederveen&#39;s
diagrams all have numbers as do the equations and pages in his book.  
You are making a statement of fact that "Nederveen describes the
difference between the missing cone based upon the body taper and that
of the neck, and their acoustical effects."  A specific citation here is
requested in order to discuss Nederveen&#39;s exact words and their
meanings.

> What Nederveen says, and what #1-#5 indicate, is that low frequency
requirements remain low frequency requirements, and higher frequency
requirements the same.  To be correct, the missing cone volume, which
insures lower frequency accuracy and response, must be determined by the
tube which generates the low frequency octave tones - the main body
tube.

Again, a conclusion has been drawn upon information in Nederveen&#39;s book
that has not been quoted directly nor referenced by page number.  In
order to respond to these arguments based on information drawn from
Nederveen&#39;s book it is necessary to have the original statements
presented verbatim and in context because as you know, information can
be interpreted in many different ways.   Thank you.

            <pre class='message__body'>There&#39;s only one diagram in Nederveen&#39;s book showing the projected missing cone of the neck (or in this case, modified upper body) taper superimposed over that of the body taper - page 119, Fig A3.15.  

"On the oboe, near the top, we sometimes find that the cone angle in the upper part of the instrument is slightly increased, in the way sketched in Fig. A3.15.  Kergomand (1988) and Dalmont et all (1995) have shown that this modification helps the higher resonances to remain harmonic up to thigher frequencies.  This can be understood as follows.  In the resonance condition eq. (27.2) the term containing the mouthpiece volume V approximately compensates the second term in the power series expansion of tan(wo-Wo). The increased cone angle near the top introduces a term which compensated the third term in this expansion."  

Nederveen&#39;s resonance formula on page 39, describes the term containing the mouthpiece volume (based upon the main body taper (as there is no other taper mentioned until the reduced taper above) as fulfilling the second term requirements in the power series he uses to describe waves in a truncated conical tube - ie. the relationship of the first octave to the second.  "Saxophones were found to have a (real) cavity volume somewhere in the proper range, Vm/Vo=1"  

The thing is John,  the entire body of hertofore published works on acoustics start out describing the volume requirement of the substitution of the ideal cone as being a prerequisite for lower frequency relationships.  In later discussion, when the reality of  increased taper angle in the neck or upper body is introduced, it is universally described as being a compensation for higher frequency relationships.  At no point is the definition of the substitutions lower frequency volume prerequisite redefined as being based upon the upper cone taper&#39;s modification for higher frequencies. Just the contrary (example: Nederveen).  Only you claim that this is so, and I have yet to see you provide one bit of published information from any organized study, to support your statement.   Show me something and I&#39;ll take it seriously, otherwise, it seems just based upon your whim, contradictory to everything else.

      A series of closed tone holes acts as an enlargement of

          Cone length and cone angle are two different things. Actually, I

The truncation ratio is the ratio of the missing part of the cone to the full cone. The missing part of the cone is determined by extrapolating from the end of the neck to the virtual conic apex by extending out using the cone angle of the tube. Obviously this missing conic apex is the same no
 matter what the length of the conic frustum (the body of the sax), and depends entirely on the diameter of the base and the cone angle. 

However, if you change the length of the frustum by opening keys, so that the air column does not reach the end of the bell, you have altered the ratio.

I don&#39;t think so.

Nederveen, page 69: "For conical reed instruments ............the truncation, i.e., the distance
between the top of the extrapolated cone and the geometric top the instrument."

The GEOMETRIC TOP  of the sax is the mouthpiece tip. The truncation ratio (Scavone&#39;s beta}
= Xo/L, Where Xo is the distance from the missing cone apex to the MP. L is the length of
the air column  measured from the apex. On page 23 of his dissertation, Scavone shows 
a graph of the partials as they are affected by beta. The greater beta, the more spread are
the partials. This makes sense because higher beta makes the sax more like a clarinet.

The junctions we use to make calculations about the missing apex are imaginary and do
not constitute a truncation in the played sax. We need a different word for these places.
{body/neck junction, neck/mp junction} Any suggestions?

Jim,

I think you are misinterpreting what Nederveen is saying.  The extrapolated cone is the "missing cone" determined by theoretically extending the truncated body to the apex.  The geometric top of the instrument is the point of truncation.  Nederveen describes this later when discussing how the truncation ratio, the ratio of the length of the truncated body, to the length of the theoretical missing cone to the apex, determines the period of reed closure during each cycle.

volume due to the compliance of a reed (between 1.2 and 1.9 
cm3, discussed later), it is comparable with that of the missing 
cone (3.35 cm3). This replacement has the effect of achieving 
resonances that fall approximately in the harmonic series 
expected for the complete cone [15, 16]. (The impedance 
peaks of a simple truncated cone are more widely spaced and 
not harmonically related.)"

Jim,

I think you are misinterpreting what Nederveen is saying.  The extrapolated cone is the "missing cone" determined by theoretically extending the truncated body to the apex.  The geometric top of the instrument is the point of truncation.  Nederveen describes this later when discussing how the
 truncation ratio, the ratio of the length of the truncated body, to the length of the theoretical missing cone to the apex, determines the period of reed closure during each cycle.

The truncation ratio isr0/r1. And you are wrong, the geometric top of the instrument is the end of the neck, the mpc is the substitution for
 the missing conic apex. It would not make a lick of sense if the substitution for the missing apex were part of the missing apex. 

This quote discusses the effect of truncation ratio on the reed cycle, and perhaps the language is clearer:

An analogous Helmholtz motion can be found in conical reed instruments. The reed alternately closes the reed channel and, similarly to the string, two phases alternate: a long phase, during which the reed channel is open, and a shorter phase, during which the reed closes the reed channel. The
 ratio N of the time duration of the two episodes is equal to the ratio of the length of the cone (which is truncated because of the reed) to the length of the missing part of the cone. This specific oscillation of the reed has a direct consequence on the spectrum: harmonics whose frequencies are
 close to N multiplied by the fundamental frequencies are weak. In other words, there is an anti-formant whose frequency is Nf1, where f1 is the fundamental frequency. This frequency does not depend on the played note and is inversely proportional to the length of the missing part of the cone. 

Scavone is discussing something completely different.

 The GEOMETRIC TOP  of the sax is the mouthpiece tip. The  truncation ratio (Scavone&#39;s beta}
 = Xo/L, Where Xo is the distance from the missing cone apex to  the MP. L is the length of
 the air column  measured from the apex. On page 23 of his  dissertation, Scavone shows 
 a graph of the partials as they are affected by beta. The  greater beta, the more spread are
 the partials. This makes sense because higher beta makes the  sax more like a clarinet.
  
 The junctions we use to make calculations about the missing  apex are imaginary and do
 not constitute a truncation in the played sax. We need a  different word for these places.

        Jim,

The truncation ratio is the ratio of the missing part of the    cone to the full cone. The missing part of the cone is determined by    extrapolating from the end of the neck to the virtual conic apex by extending    out using the cone angle of the tube. Obviously this missing conic apex is the   
 same no matter what the length of the conic frustum (the body of the sax), and    depends entirely on the diameter of the base and the cone angle.    

However, if you change the length of the frustum by opening keys, so    that the air column does not reach the end of the bell, you have altered the    ratio.

 designer reduced the initial taper x              slightly, in order to compensate for the added compliance of the              tone holes or left the end diameter unchanged but changed the              position of the tone holes (length), thus narrowing the taper, then              your

The thing is, you              don&#39;t know for sure what any manufacturer&#39;s initial design is              or what compensations are made.

I suggest, since non of the              as yet published works on acoustics (save Ferron, which many have              more or less thrown out the window in many regards) substantiate              John&#39;s premise, that he submit a comprehensive study for review by              the interested

I, for one, am not annoyed.

It may get a bit tiresome, but it belongs here certainly. Also, I think the
recursiveness is helpful (each time I get a little more).

Haven&#39;t people been at parties, with different converations taking place in

Jim,

Nederveen&#39;s model is closed at the end, with a V chamber positioned directly over the tube.  Therein lies you confusion perhaps.

forum so as to not annoy some here.
 
Concerning Nederveen fig 27.5, r0 is the distance

  Jim, with all due respect, this is absolutely incorrect. Check Nederveen pg 
  39. Look at fig. 27.5. r0 is the truncated part of the cone, r1 is the full 
  cone. The truncation ratio isr0/r1. And you are wrong, the geometric top of 
  the instrument is the end of the neck, the mpc is the substitution for the 
  missing conic apex. It would not make a lick of sense if the substitution for 
  the missing apex were part of the missing apex. 

This quote discusses 
  the effect of truncation ratio on the reed cycle, and perhaps the language is 
  clearer:

An analogous Helmholtz motion can be found in conical reed 
  instruments. The reed alternately closes the reed channel and, similarly to 
  the string, two phases alternate: a long phase, during which the reed channel 
  is open, and a shorter phase, during which the reed closes the reed channel. 
  The ratio N of the time duration of 
  the two episodes is equal to the ratio of the length of the cone (which is 
  truncated because of the reed) to the length of the missing part of the cone. 
  This specific oscillation of the reed has a direct consequence on the 
  spectrum: harmonics whose frequencies are close to N multiplied by the 
  fundamental frequencies are weak. In other words, there is an anti-formant 
  whose frequency is Nf1, where f1 is the fundamental frequency. This frequency 
  does not depend on the played note and is inversely proportional to the length 
  of the missing part of the cone. 

Scavone is discussing something 
  completely different.

    The GEOMETRIC TOP  of the sax is the mouthpiece tip. 
    The truncation ratio (Scavone&#39;s beta}

    the sax more like a clarinet.
     
    The junctions we use to make calculations about the

    not constitute a truncation in the played sax. We need a

      Jim,

The truncation ratio is the ratio of the missing part of 
      the cone to the full cone. The missing part of the cone is determined by 
      extrapolating from the end of the neck to the virtual conic apex by 
      extending out using the cone angle of the tube. Obviously this missing 
      conic apex is the same no matter what the length of the conic frustum (the 
      body of the sax), and depends entirely on the diameter of the base and the 
      cone angle. 

However, if you change the length of the frustum by 
      opening keys, so that the air column does not reach the end of the bell, 
      you have altered the ratio.

              A series of closed tone holes acts as an 
                enlargement of the bore.  If the designer started with a 
                cone of x degree taper and added tone holes, then in effect, the 
                taper would become wider.  If however, the designer reduced 
                the initial taper x slightly, in order to compensate for the 
                added compliance of the tone holes or left the end diameter 
                unchanged but changed the position of the tone holes (length), 
                thus narrowing the taper, then your observation would be 
                invalid.  

The thing is, you don&#39;t know for sure 
                what any manufacturer&#39; s initial design is or what 
                compensations are made.  I can follow your and John&#39;s 
                logic, but your postulation is not based upon anything solid, 
                not mathematics, not any scientific procedure, nor any empirical 
                trial and error testing.  It is mere supposition which you 
                are stating as fact more or less.  Something which you 
                usually come down hard on others for.  

I suggest, 
                since non of the as yet published works on acoustics (save 
                Ferron, which many have more or less thrown out the window in 
                many regards) substantiate John&#39;s premise, that he submit a 
                comprehensive study for review by the interested acoustical 
                society, in which he also responds convincingly to every 
                heretofore published study stating the contrary view.

                  Cone length and cone angle are two different things. 
                  Actually, I wonder if the extra compliance of the closed tone 
                  holes actually changes the effective cone angle, or just act 
                  as an extra tube length. Do you 
                  know?

You speak as if no compensations are

                          tube length) for the effects of the extra compliance

Just one last thing here. Nederveen is representing the volume of the mpc as V, substituting for the volume V0 of the truncated apex. The end is closed because when the mpc is on the sax the end is closed. He just put the mpc at right angles to make the conic truncation clearer.

The truncation ratio of the sax is about 1:10. If you include the mpc as the geometric end of the instrument then the truncation ratio becomes something like 1:5, which is clearly incorrect.

Toby,
  
 Good discussion, but maybe we should move it to the  "acoustics" section of the other
 forum so as to not annoy some here.
  
 Concerning Nederveen fig 27.5, r0 is the distance  from the missing apex to the closed end
 of the sax. The end of the neck is not  closed.

        Jim, with all due respect, this is absolutely incorrect. Check Nederveen pg    39. Look at fig. 27.5. r0 is the truncated part of the cone, r1 is the full    cone. The truncation ratio isr0/r1. And you are wrong, the geometric top of    the instrument is the end of the neck, the mpc is the
 substitution for the    missing conic apex. It would not make a lick of sense if the substitution for    the missing apex were part of the missing apex. 

This quote discusses    the effect of truncation ratio on the reed cycle, and perhaps the language is    clearer:

An analogous Helmholtz motion can be found in conical reed    instruments. The reed alternately closes the reed channel and, similarly to    the string, two phases alternate: a long phase, during which the reed channel    is open, and a shorter phase, during which the reed closes the reed channel.
    The ratio N of the time duration of    the two episodes is equal to the ratio of the length of the cone (which is    truncated because of the reed) to the length of the missing part of the cone.    This specific oscillation of the reed has a direct consequence on the    spectrum: harmonics
 whose frequencies are close to N multiplied by the    fundamental frequencies are weak. In other words, there is an anti-formant    whose frequency is Nf1, where f1 is the fundamental frequency. This frequency    does not depend on the played note and is inversely proportional to the length    of
 the missing part of the cone. 

Scavone is discussing something    completely different.

     Toby,
      
     I don&#39;t think so.
      
     Nederveen, page 69: "For conical reed instruments      ............the truncation, i.e., the distance
     between the top of the extrapolated cone and the geometric      top the instrument."
      
     The GEOMETRIC TOP  of the sax is the mouthpiece tip.      The truncation ratio (Scavone&#39;s beta}
     = Xo/L, Where Xo is the distance from the missing cone      apex to the MP. L is the length of
     the air column  measured from the apex. On page 23 of      his dissertation, Scavone shows 
     a graph of the partials as they are affected by beta. The      greater beta, the more spread are
     the partials. This makes sense because higher beta makes      the sax more like a clarinet.
      
     The junctions we use to make calculations about the      missing apex are imaginary and do
     not constitute a truncation in the played sax. We need a      different word for these places.
     {body/neck junction, neck/mp junction} Any      suggestions?

                Jim,

The truncation ratio is the ratio of the missing part of        the cone to the full cone. The missing part of the cone is determined by        extrapolating from the end of the neck to the virtual conic apex by        extending out using the cone angle of the tube. Obviously this missing       
 conic apex is the same no matter what the length of the conic frustum (the        body of the sax), and depends entirely on the diameter of the base and the        cone angle. 

However, if you change the length of the frustum by        opening keys, so that the air column does not reach the end of the bell,        you have altered the ratio.

 would become wider.  If however, the designer reduced                  the initial taper x slightly, in order to compensate for the                  added compliance of the tone holes or left the end diameter                  unchanged but changed the position of the tone holes (length),         
         thus narrowing the taper, then your observation would be                  invalid.  

The thing is, you don&#39;t know for sure                  what any manufacturer&#39;s initial design is or what                  compensations are made.

 scientific procedure, nor any empirical                  trial and error testing.  It is mere supposition which you                  are stating as fact more or less.  Something which you                  usually come down hard on others for.  

I suggest,                  since non of the as yet published works on acoustics (save                  Ferron, which many have more or less thrown out the window in                  many regards) substantiate John&#39;s premise, that he submit a                  comprehensive study for review by the
 interested acoustical                  society, in which he also responds convincingly to every                  heretofore published study stating the contrary view.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

I don&#39; think anyone is pretending that saxes are designed by theory alone. But theory is valuable, or could be valuable, if makers would or could employ it. Here is a quote from the foreword to Nederveen&#39;s book:

"Physicists are strange people who do not rest before everything is &#39;understood&#39;, which to them means: &#39;formulated in mathematical relations and equations&#39;. Musical instruments obey fundamental physical laws, and it is understandable therefore that many prominent acousticians--such as von Helmholtz, Rayleigh and Bonasse--have studied various aspects of instruments&#39; behavior, and not without success.

An important aim of investigations into a musical instrument is to explain its pitch when sounded, a subject already initiated by Pythagoras, though in a somewhat mystical manner. Were this problem solved for all instruments, a significant step in the direction of scientific design would have been taken. In instrument-making today, rule-of-thumb or trial-and-error methods are far too often the ruling factor. [my emphasis]

In my opinion, the author of this book...has been successful in giving a physical and mathematical description of many, if not of all, mechanisms governing the tuning of woodwind instruments. He has thus made an important contribution toward the qualitative and quantitative explanation of their behavior. His results constitute a powerful tool both for correcting tuning errors in existing instruments and for creating new designs."

Nederveen himself says:

"Because empirically designed instruments are fairly satisfactory, there has always been a lack of commercial interest in instrument research...Moreover, a musical instrument often is said to be a work of art inaccessible to scientific research although several publications suggest otherwise. These resent investigations have increased knowledge in matters of tuning and tone-quality of musical instruments, knowledge that can replace mere trial-and-error by scientific calculations. Up to now, however, there have been no spectacular results and this may explain the reserve of musicians and instrument makers toward research..."

As I keep saying, no one is proposing that we should try to design an instrument solely on the drawing board; however science can certainly to better designs. It is interesting to consider that the airplane is much younger than the sax, but dedicated R&D (from commercial pressures, to be sure) has brought us incredible advances in its form. In less than 75 years we went from the Wright Flyer I to the SR-71 Blackbird, and now to the F-22 Raptor. In that time the sax got an automatic octave key and a high F#.

Of course these products are not really comparable, but it may well be that science does hold some keys towards significant improvements in musical instrument design. One only has to look at the flute pre- and post-Böhm to see what is possible in instrument design. Makers stumbled along with small incremental improvements in the same basic design for about 200 years, until old Theobald completely changed the playing field. There were hundreds of flute makers, both large and small, who were left in the dust by his new design, based largely on newly-understood acoustic principles.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Toby,

I really believe that some things are best ignored.  I wouldn&#39;t waste my
time defending against such petty backbiting.  It really says more about
the source than it does about those of us who are engaged in an
intelligent discussion.  &#39;Nuf said.

  While the missing cone debate has been raging, I have been doing some
more calculations and extending some of the studies I have previously
posted on my website.  Here are the fruits of my labors.

Basically I began by  finding the ideal spot on the neck for a
mouthpiece on a saxophone I am very familiar with.  Because the tuning
and intonation aligns so beautifully at this spot, the assumption was
made that the volume of the missing cone is effectively replicated by
the equivalent volume of the mouthpiece when it is played in that exact
position.

From there I worked backwards measuring the physical volume of the
mouthpiece, calculating the volume to add to that to get the total
"effective volume" using the method described by Benade.  Once that
figure was obtained, I used Ferron&#39;s math to calculate the taper of the
neck, and from there the length and volume of the missing  cone
extrapolated by extending the taper of the neck.  The calculated volume
of that missing cone was then compared to the effective volume of the
mouthpiece.   The results were within 1.8 % of perfect agreement.

To test the theory that the volume of the missing cone should be
extrapolated by using the taper of the body as Lance suggests, the body
measurements were taken and the slope found for the body tube.  Using
the same formulas as before it was found that the slope of the body
differed from that of the neck by .2 degrees.  This resulted in a
missing cone 50 mm longer than the missing cone calculated from the neck
taper, and a missing cone whose volume was 10 ml greater than the one
calculated from the neck.
This missing cone volume was nowhere close to that of the mouthpiece in
its ideal spot on the neck.  In other words:

In order to replicate this missing cone volume requirement the
mouthpiece would have to be pulled completely off the neck cork and it
would still be 3 ml short!

Based on these findings it appears that Ferron&#39;s idea of extending the
neck is the more accurate one to follow to calculate the missing
cone---at least for the saxophone and mouthpiece used for this study.

The full study with scale drawings and formulas used can be found at

rule-of-thumb or trial-and-error methods are far too often the ruling
factor. [my emphasis]

mechanisms governing the tuning of woodwind instruments. He has thus
made an important contribution toward the qualitative and quantitative
explanation of their behavior. His results constitute a powerful tool
both for correcting tuning errors in existing instruments and for
creating new designs."

there has always been a lack of commercial interest in instrument
research...Moreover, a musical instrument often is said to be a work of
art inaccessible to scientific research although several publications
suggest otherwise. These resent investigations have increased knowledge
in matters of tuning and tone-quality of musical instruments, knowledge
that can replace mere trial-and-error by scientific calculations. Up to
now, however, there have been no spectacular results and this may
explain the reserve of musicians and instrument makers toward
research..."

instrument solely on the drawing board; however science can certainly to
better designs. It is interesting to consider that the airplane is much
younger than the sax, but dedicated R&D (from commercial pressures, to
be sure) has brought us incredible advances in its form. In less than 75
years we went from the Wright Flyer I to the SR-71 Blackbird, and now to
the F-22 Raptor. In that time the sax got an automatic octave key and a
high F#.

that science does hold some keys towards significant improvements in
musical instrument design. One only has to look at the flute pre- and
post-Böhm to see what is possible in instrument design. Makers
stumbled along with small incremental improvements in the same basic
design for about 200 years, until old Theobald completely changed the
playing field. There were hundreds of flute makers, both large and
small, who were left in the dust by his new design, based largely on
newly-understood acoustic principles.

It seems that your experiments point to the neck angle as
being the main determinant of the truncation volume. It
may well be so. It would be interesting to test a few
different horns and see how well the data correlates, as
(according to Nederveen) the cone angle(s) can vary widely
between different sax designs.

It is probably also important to remember that there are a
number of factors which influence intonation, some quite
greatly, such as ambient temperature. Are you testing at
temps around 27 degrees?

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

You may want to recheck your measurements, formulas and figures, as using your measurements and only calculating the volume of cones (the volume of a cone is a simple calculation - and subtracting your defined cones from one another) I get entirely different results, so something is definitely wrong.:

The volume of the neck taper missing cone based upon your neck radius (6.3mm) and missing cone length (213.7mm) is the same ( 8.88cl).  You claim your neck has a volume of 49cl, however calculating the cone from the large end of the neck radius (11.4mm) to the apex (386.7mm) and subtracting the missing cone 8.88cl from that gives me a neck volume of 43.54cl.  The volume of the cylindrical tenon section (without the gap) is 8.72cl, and I estimate the 1mm gap at the base of the tenon to be .452cl, for a mystery volume of 9.17ml.  I say mystery, since you don&#39;t include it in any of your calculations or explanations.

Taking your body measurements, you claim that the missing cone based upon the length (453.63mm) and the body small end radius (11.54mm) has total volume of 67.86cl, from which you subtract your neck volume of 49cl to get your final 18.86cl, excessively large body taper based mouthpiece volume.  

My cone calculator says a cone with a base radius of 11.54mm and a lenght of 457.63mm has a volume of 63.82cl, from which we subtract my neck volume of 43.54cl, and also the mystery volume of  9.17cl (since your diagram indicates this volume&#39;s length is part of the missing cone, and as such it&#39;s volume belongs to the neck.), so the total body based mouthpiece volume should be 10.9cl.   Still, that is not accurate since there are obviously mistakes in your figures.

Let&#39;s get it straightened out.

Believe me, they’e ALWAYS looking for new ideas and ways to improve their products…..I got started in the design consulting business many years ago by building a better product and taking it to the NAMM show and letting the manufacturers play it and see that it was better. At the time, none of the factory owners knew me from Adam. You have to prove to them you know what you are talking about, have original ideas, and the chops to implement the ideas and demonstrate that they are a clear improvement. I think they recognize that there is a huge difference between actually doing it and just talking about it……at least that’s been my experience

In your "shoot from the hip" response to try to discredit the  measurements and findings of my study, you obviously overlooked an important detail.  Since I am on my way to work this morning, I don&#39;t have time to offer a detailed response to your arguments at this time.

With embouchure variations and equipment variations, I doubt that there will always be voluime comparison agreement within a few percent.  But I would like to re-visit and update the calcualations I did years ago and add some of the detials you have that I did not consider.

Hi Toby,

I really believe that some things are best ignored.  I wouldn&#39;t waste my time defending against such petty backbiting.  It really says more about the source than it does about those of us who are engaged in an intelligent discussion.  &#39;Nuf said.

 While the missing cone debate has been raging, I have been doing some more calculations and extending some of the studies I have previously posted on my website.  Here are the fruits of my labors.

Basically I began by  finding the ideal spot on the neck for a mouthpiece on a saxophone I am very familiar with.  Because the tuning and intonation aligns so beautifully at this spot, the assumption was made that the volume of the missing cone is effectively replicated by the equivalent volume of the mouthpiece when it is played in that exact position.   

From there I worked backwards measuring the physical volume of the mouthpiece, calculating the volume to add to that to get the total "effective volume" using the method described by Benade.  Once that figure was obtained, I used Ferron&#39;s math to calculate the taper of the neck, and from there the length and volume of the missing  cone extrapolated by extending the taper of the neck.  The calculated volume of that missing cone was then compared to the effective volume of the mouthpiece.   The results were within 1.8 % of perfect agreement.

To test the theory that the volume of the missing cone should be extrapolated by using the taper of the body as Lance suggests, the body measurements were taken and the slope found for the body tube.  Using the same formulas as before it was found that the slope of the body differed from that of the neck by .2 degrees.  This resulted in a missing cone 50 mm longer than the missing cone calculated from the neck taper, and a missing cone whose volume was 10 ml greater than the one calculated from the neck.
This missing cone volume was nowhere close to that of the mouthpiece in its ideal spot on the neck.  In other words:

In order to replicate this missing cone volume requirement the mouthpiece would have to be pulled completely off the neck cork and it would still be 3 ml short!

Based on these findings it appears that Ferron&#39;s idea of extending the neck is the more accurate one to follow to calculate the missing cone---at least for the saxophone and mouthpiece used for this study.

The full study with scale drawings and formulas used can be found at this link:  Missing Cone Volume Comparison Study 

To see how the "effective volume" of the mouthpiece was determined go to: Mouthpiece Effective Volume

In less than 75 years we went from the Wright Flyer I to the SR-71 Blackbird, and now to the F-22 Raptor. In that time the sax got an automatic octave key and a high F#.

One only has to look at the flute pre- and post-Böhm to see what is possible in instrument design. Makers stumbled along with small incremental improvements in the same basic design for about 200 years, until old Theobald completely changed the playing field. There were hundreds of flute makers, both large and small, who were left in the dust by his new design, based largely on newly-understood acoustic principles.

I do think you guys are doing the saxophone community a great disservice through the implication that this is how the saxophone design process works. It isn&#39;t. Not even close.

Just a thought..that&#39; s the way most scientific/academic research is validated.

The point that Steve Goodson designs and makes saxophones and others do not has been made time and time and time again.  We all get it.  Can we please give that a rest for a while and just discuss those topics that are of personal interest and just ignore the rest?

            <pre class='message__body'>"Maybe everybody is NOT satisfied, as you say, Lance."

I have not tried any new horns of late myself, but I do have a client who just sent me his Zephyr alto.  He emailed me that he had been to the Namm show, and tried every horn available, and decided he would be happier investing more money in his King.  FWIW.

At this point, I make key-work, conical tenons, and do various other modifications to mostly vintage horns.  I plan to start making mouthpieces and necks very soon.   Designing an entire horn is still a few forum discussions away I think.  

As you can see from John&#39;s work on cone volume, we&#39;re still trying to agree on how to measure and calculate things so we can compare notes intelligently.  That still has some value I think.

important detail."

Hi John,

I&#39;ve been over your document a number of times.  Let&#39;s address one issue at a time - Measured Neck Volume.   You don&#39;t explain how you measured the neck volume.  Calculations from the measurements you give for your neck (diameters and lengths) do not produce your results, neither the 173mm section nor that section with the tenon volume nor tenon and gap volume added.

The only other explanation is, you measured the actual volume of the neck/tenon (I assume) with water.  Fine.  That would be the actual physical volume of the neck then.  There is one problem with consistency then, if that is the case..  

If your measured and diagrammed neck illustration data, produces an inaccurate neck volume calculation, because of the bend and shape of the actual physical neck - i.e., you must resort to actual physical water volume measurements to get an accurate volume measurement, why would you consider the calculated results for the neck&#39;s taper and the resultant missing cone length, which are based on the same insufficient illustrated shapes and measurements, to be accurate?

I think a mm by mm plot of the neck diameter would be revealing.

Lance

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,

One clear calculation error:

Volume of the body taper determined missing cone.

Your measurements:  

cone base radius = 11.54mm (23.8mm diameter)
cone length = 457.63mm

Your volume calculation = 67.86cl
My calculation (4 different online cone calculators and excel) = 63.82cl

How do you explain the 4cl difference?

The point that Steve Goodson designs and makes saxophones and others do not has been made time and time and time again. We all get it. Can we please give that a rest for a while and just discuss those topics that are of personal interest and just ignore the rest?

To begin with, one half of 23.8 is 11.9 . . . .

Here is my response to the earlier post about the missing cone volume
study.

The volume of the neck taper missing cone based upon your neck radius
(6.3mm) and missing cone length (213.7mm) is the same ( 8.88cl).

So far so good.

You claim your neck has a volume of 49cl, however calculating the cone
from the large end of the neck radius (11.4mm) to the apex (386.7mm) and
subtracting the missing cone 8.88cl from that gives me a neck volume of
43.54cl.

A careful reading of my study shows that the neck has a measured volume
of 49 ml.  This was a conservative reading using a syringe to fill the
neck with water.  Checking the measured volume today using a graduated
cylinder borrowed from work, the measured volume is closer to 50 ml. 
Substituting that figure would not significantly change the results.

The volume of the cylindrical tenon section (without the gap) is 8.72cl,
and I estimate the 1mm gap at the base of the tenon to be .452cl, for a
mystery volume of 9.17ml.  I say mystery, since you don&#39;t include it in
any of your calculations or explanations.

That is correct for the calculated volume of the cylindrical tenon at
the base of the neck.  That volume is obviously included in the 49 ml
measured volume of the neck.  A "gap" is not a part of the neck
of the saxophone and as such was not included in my calculations of the
missing cone extrapolated from the taper of the neck.

Taking your body measurements, you claim that the missing cone based
upon the length (453.63mm) and the body small end radius (11.54mm) has
total volume of 67.86cl, from which you subtract your neck volume of
49cl to get your final 18.86cl, excessively large body taper based
mouthpiece volume.

Actually the radius is 11.9 mm not 11.54, but the rest is correct.

My cone calculator says a cone with a base radius of 11.54mm and a
length of 457.63mm has a volume of 63.82cl,

My calculations as follows are correct using 11.9 mm as the radius, and
by the way the 456.73 mm length includes the notorious 1mm gap.

11.9 sq = 141.61,
141.61 x 3.1416 = 444.88,
444.88  x 457.63 = 203,590.43
203,590.43 divided by 3000 = 67.86 ml

. . .from which we subtract my neck volume of 43.54cl, and also the
mystery volume of  9.17cl (since your diagram indicates this volume&#39;s
length is part of the missing cone, and as such it&#39;s volume belongs to
the neck.), so the total body based mouthpiece volume should be 10.9cl.
Still, that is not accurate since there are obviously mistakes in your
figures.

These remaining arguments carry no weight since the actual measured
volume of the neck was used throughout, there is no "mystery
volume",  and there are no mistakes in my figures.

Let&#39;s look at why there may be a 2 or 3 ml discrepancy between the
calculated volume inside the neck and the actual measured volume.  My
thoughts are:

1. The difficulty of getting an entirely accurate measurement of the
length.  I am working on a string of wooden beads in graduated sizes to
help solve this problem.

2.  The fact that the neck may not be a completely straight sided cone. 
If the sides are slightly concave the volume will be less.  If the walls
are slightly convex the volume will be more.

Let&#39;s get it straightened out.

I&#39;ve done my best to straighten it out.  I look forward to others
doing their own study and having the chance to compare the results.

Thanks for clearing that up John.  It was late last night.  

Since you are using actual volume measurement, and the radii of the conical neck section are fixed,  determining the actual effective length is simply a matter of calculating the missing variable from the known volume and the known radii.  If we go with 49cl volume, and subtract the known cylindrical volume of ca. 9cl, then the actual conical neck volume is 40cl, the effective neck length is around 158mm, instead of 173mm, which makes your taper more acute, your missing cone shorter (195mm, instead of 217mm) and the missing cone volume smaller (8.11cl, instead of 8.88cl)

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Lance,

There is no such thing as the "effective length" of the neck.  It&#39;s
measured geometric length is its length. It is that length that is
transversed by the soundwave as it passes through the neck. It would be
the length of an imaginary string suspended in the exact center of the
tapered-bent tube from top to bottom.   Hopefully my beaded string will
come close to measuring it that way.

You are going by the assumption that the radii and volume will give the
the exact height (length)  of the ideal straight walled truncated cone. 
That is true, but the neck is most probably not an ideal straight
walled/even tapered cone.  To paraphrase Popeye, "It is  what it is" and
needs to be treated as such in the measurements and calculations.  You
are probably thinking "then how can we trust Ferron&#39;s  taper formula to
give us an accurate missing cone?"  One way to check would be to use
Nederveen&#39;s measurements of the saxophone "crooks" as he calls them. 
One could calculate the taper from  each measurement point, average them
all, and then compare to the taper calculated using the top and bottom
measurements.  It wouldn&#39;t be that hard since he has done the work
already.

The mouthpiece is another story altogether, since its total effective or
equivalent volume or effective length for that matter bears little
resemblance to its geometric proportions.

I&#39;m guessing it doesn&#39;t make a large difference in the
bend of a sax neck for our purposes.

BTW, do either of you remember the source of article about
cutting a groove just behind the tip rail of a mpc to
change the Bernoulli forces and improve response? I&#39;m
thinking it was Benade, but I can&#39;t find it anywhere. I&#39;ve
got a Beechler alto piece that I have never really liked,
and I am thinking about sacrificing it to science...

Sorry to cut in but I too have a Beechler. It is an ordinary hard rubber one. No diamond inlay and it has a constricted throat. I have taken it to 80 thou vintage Meyer 5 as per the groups posts. I thinned the rails near the tip as much as I could without altering the appearance too much.  This piece is my current go to and plays with a lovely sound a bit warmer than a Meyer. It is very consistent right through the range and screams in the harmonics.  It goes from a very small roll over to an even straight baffle down in to the chamber. 
Just today I checked the facing again to make sure that it was true.
It plays just that little bit stuffy and I am at a loss to understand why. I am comparing it to various Meyers that I have.
Do you have the same problem?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Ross,

Mine is a Bellite metal. Very edgy, very thin. When I first bought it I couldn&#39;t stop it from squeaking and chirping, no matter how careful I was. After I started working on mpcs I realized that the facing was totally unbalanced. I&#39;ve got it now so that it plays, but it is still much more
 tempermental than any of my other alto pcs, so it has been sitting in my box for a long time. 

About a year ago I read an article, I think by Benade, where he talks about the fact that cutting a rather deep groove just behind the tip rail is quite beneficial, as it allows Bernoulli forces to act to close the reed tip. I have found that taking down the area just behind the tip rail on other
 mpcs was always helpful to their response, without seriously altering the sound. 

Because this mpc is stainless steel, I have avoided trying any serious routing, as one slip with a diamond bit would mean the end of the tip rail. I&#39;m considering making a cutout jig from metal to act as a stop to keep this from happening: perhaps even plastic would work--it just needs to be in
 the way if the bit slips to absorb the damage.

If and when I do this I&#39;ll report back. I&#39;m very interested in just how this mod will change the playing characteristics of the piece (and the sound). If it really does make the response better without changing the timbre too much, it might be a valuable fix for very-high-baffle pieces in general,
 as I find they tend to be more chirpy than more conservative designs.

In terms of stuffiness: Look for any edges in your Beechler: especially at the window cutout and where the chamber becomes the throat. If you round those off you might find your mpc becomes less stuffy. In any case it can&#39;t hurt anything.

FWIW,
Toby

Toby,
 Sorry to cut in but I too have a Beechler. It is an  ordinary hard rubber one. No diamond inlay and it has a constricted throat. I  have taken it to 80 thou vintage Meyer 5 as per the groups posts. I thinned the  rails near the tip as much as I could without altering the appearance too  much. 
 This piece is my current go to and plays with a lovely sound a bit  warmer than a Meyer. It is very consistent right through the range and screams  in the harmonics.  It goes from a very small roll over to an even straight  baffle down in to the chamber. 
 Just today I checked the facing again to make sure  that it was true.
 It plays just that little bit stuffy and I am at a  loss to understand why. I am comparing it to various Meyers that I  have.
 Do you have the same problem?
 cheers

            <pre class='message__body'>The HR Beechler is an underated Meyer Bros-like blank.  Make sure the facing curve compares well to the other Meyer-like mouthpieces you are comparing it to.  Also hold them up side-by-side and compare the baffle roll-overs and slope going  into the throat.  You do not need to make them all clones.  But if you are trying to determine why your Beechler is stuffy, this may show you some differences.

Often a slightly softer reed is all you need to make a stuffy set-up bloom into a vibrant one.  Sometimes you need to get a few bumps off the facing curve.  You can also try adding a dab of baffle with temporary putty to see if that is an adjustment that works.

It was in this reference:

hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/25/27/96/PDF/ajp-jp4199404C5120.pdf

Which says this:

"when a sharp edged ditch is carved just downstream of the reed channel exit
one can experience an easier attack transient."

In illustration "C", we see a cross section of a mouthpiece with said ditch
carved just behind what I construe as the tip rail.

            <pre class='message__body'>By cutting a groove you would actually be lowering the Bernoulli effect.  The velocity would slow down and /or become turbulent depending on the depth cut.  Perhaps the goal was to only keep the Bernoulii effect at the tip rail and have it fall off afterwards.  

I see an advantage of removing or lowering roll-over baffles when mouthpieces are squeaking.  Especially on high baffle mouthpieces.  There is little need for a roll-over AND a high wedge bafffle.  

A few mouthpiece design have a "lake" after the tip rail.  A lot of Bergs have a flat area but a few have a concave "lake".  A few special Lawtons had them.  They have not really caught on since they do not offer a significant advantage and/or are difficult to make.  

Metalites have a fall-off after the tip rail then their high baffle starts.

"In two places, tenor and alto saxophones have bends in the bore. The
crook in the upper part of the bore shows very low curvature and does
not exercise any appreciable influence.  The reverse is the case for the
sharp bend in the lower part.  This bend affects only the lowest notes
and does not even come into play for the upper register.  The length of
the bend is about 12% of the acoustical length of the lowest
fundamental.  In Section 37 it was shown that such sharp bends
correspond to a shortening and widening of the equivalent straight tube,
where the differences may be of the order of 5% for the curved parts. 
This means that a perceptible increase of the resonance frequency is not
unlikely."

But it&#39;s ok to juggle the neck volume?  Can you used a 173mm long, diagrammed neck of 43.74cl volume to determine the neck taper missing cone, though your physical neck counterpart has a volume of only 40cl.  Then, when figuring the body tube missing cone volume, is it correct to subtract the physical neck volume of 40cl (+tenon +gap) instead of the 173mm long, diagrammed neck of 43.74cl (+tenon +gap).   I think your neck volumes should remain constant.

Nederveen, p61, says that slight bends do not require any correction.  His example of a tight bend requiring 4% correction is a ratio of the tube diameter radius, to the bend radius of 0.55.  An alto neck would not require correction then.

 It was in this reference:
 
 hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/25/27/96/PDF/ajp-jp4199404C5120.pdf
 
 Which says this:
 
 "when a sharp edged ditch is carved just downstream of the reed channel exit
 one can experience an easier attack transient."
 
 In illustration "C", we see a cross section of a mouthpiece with said ditch
 carved just behind what I construe as the tip rail.

 Hi Ross,
 
 Mine is a Bellite metal. Very edgy, very thin. When I first bought it I couldn&#39;t stop it from squeaking and chirping, no matter how careful I was. After I started working on mpcs I realized that the facing was totally unbalanced. I&#39;ve got it now so that it plays, but it is still much more
 tempermental than any of my other alto pcs, so it has been sitting in my box for a long time. 
 
 About a year ago I read an article, I think by Benade, where he talks about the fact that cutting a rather deep groove just behind the tip rail is quite beneficial, as it allows Bernoulli forces to act to close the reed tip. I have found that taking down the area just behind the tip rail on other
 mpcs was always helpful to their response, without seriously altering the sound. 
 
 Because this mpc is stainless steel, I have avoided trying any serious routing, as one slip with a diamond bit would mean the end of the tip rail. I&#39;m considering making a cutout jig from metal to act as a stop to keep this from happening: perhaps even plastic would work--it just needs to be in
 the way if the bit slips to absorb the damage.
 
 If and when I do this I&#39;ll report back. I&#39;m very interested in just how this mod will change the playing characteristics of the piece (and the sound). If it really does make the response better without changing the timbre too much, it might be a valuable fix for very-high-baffle pieces in
 general, as I find they tend to be more chirpy than more conservative designs.
 
 In terms of stuffiness: Look for any edges in your Beechler: especially at the window cutout and where the chamber becomes the throat. If you round those off you might find your mpc becomes less stuffy. In any case it can&#39;t hurt anything.
 
 Toby
 
 FWIW,

 Toby,
  
 Sorry to cut in but I too have a Beechler. It is an  ordinary hard rubber one. No diamond inlay and it has a constricted throat. I  have taken it to 80 thou vintage Meyer 5 as per the groups posts. I thinned the  rails near the tip as much as I could without altering the appearance too  much. 
 This piece is my current go to and plays with a lovely sound a bit  warmer than a Meyer. It is very consistent right through the range and screams  in the harmonics.  It goes from a very small roll over to an even straight  baffle down in to the chamber. 
  
 Just today I checked the facing again to make sure  that it was true.
  
 It plays just that little bit stuffy and I am at a  loss to understand why. I am comparing it to various Meyers that I  have.
  
 Do you have the same problem?
  
 cheers

No one is juggling the neck volume but you.  The actual measured volume
of the neck including the tenon section used in my study was 49 ml.  In
the first part of the study the virtual missing cone was calculated from
the end of the neck using the taper of the neck.  The volume of that
imaginary missing cone to its apex was then added to the physical real
world volume of the neck including the tenon to get a total to be
compared to the second part of the study which calculated a "missing
cone" from the body of the saxophone---specifically from the bottom of
the tenon receiver.

Then, when figuring the body tube missing cone volume, is it correct to
subtract the physical neck volume of 40cl (+tenon +gap) instead of the
173mm long, diagrammed neck of 43.74cl (+tenon +gap).   I think your
neck volumes should remain constant.

Again, the measured neck volume including the tenon is 49 ml.  It is
this volume that gives the neck&#39;s portion of the virtual missing cone
derived by extending the body taper.   The same real world measured neck
volume was used throughout the study. There was no "juggling" of the
neck volume as suggested, and in fact the neck volume remained constant.

The part that I think is most important to understand is that if the
volume of the missing cone derived by extending the taper of the main
body to its apex is larger in its first 197 mm (the measured length of
the neck including the tenon) than the real world measured physical
volume of the neck, then the remainder of the missing cone that the
mouthpiece substitutes for must be even larger to make up the
difference.  This is in fact what was found in this study that made the
missing cone extrapolated from the body taper unpractical.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry, but I&#39;m still confused.  Humor me please.

You used the dimensions of your physical neck (length 173mm, radii of  11.4mm and 6.3mm), without the tenon, to calculate the taper and the missing cone&#39;s first instance.  Correct?

Though you did not do it, I feel compelled to compare the actual volume of the physical neck section you used for your measurements (without tenon) with the calculated volume of the model, Ferron neck (without tenon).

The tenon and gap have a volume of just over 9cl.  Subtracting that from your 49cl neck + tenon+ gap volume, leave 40cl volume for your curved neck tube  (length 173mm, radii of  11.4mm and 6.3mm).  Your model, Ferron neck, of the same dimensions, has a volume of 43.74cl.  

So, 3.74cl, a 9.35% difference.  You and Toby felt that the extra actual volume added by the tone holes, would make the body tube taper model measurements inaccurate.  Do you think that having 9.35% less actual neck volume than your model, Ferron neck tube does the same thing?  I&#39;m certain that the additional volume added by the tone holes (flow entering the tone hole only up to 10% of the hole&#39;s diameter) to the body tube would be far, far, far less than 9.35%.

            <pre class='message__body'>Back to mouthpieces for just a moment...

I went ahead and modded my Beechler Bellite alto piece. I bought this many years ago, with a 9 tip opening--a suicidal choice. At first it was impossible to play--squeaked no matter what I tried. 

Some years ago when I started refacing, I took it back out and cut it down to around a 7, took down the back of the baffle a bit and most importantly evened out the very unbalanced rails. 

This helped quite a bit, but I could never get it too chirp-resistant; it was always a bit edgy. A pity, because it really screams, and is useful in those too-loud bands. It has extremely thin side rails, and I thought this in a high baffle piece might explain its behavior.

As I mentioned, I thought it might be worthwhile (since it just sat in a box), to try to cut a ridge behind the tip rail, as suggested in that paper (unfortunately no longer online).

So today I took out my Dremel (with the flexible shaft attachment). It ain&#39;t a micromotor but with the shaft it is decent for fine work in tight places. I have a set of thirty diamond stonecutter&#39;s bits, and I found it relatively easy to control the cut--actually the hardness of the SS made it
 much easier to work with than had it been a softer material, although it took a bit longer. I&#39;ve posted a pic. It ain&#39;t beautiful, as it is hard to get it even with a 1 mm diamond ball, but it works. I cut behind the tip rail and around a bit down the side rails.

I also decided to get rid of all the edges in the mpc. I rounded the bottom of the window and took the edge off the inside of the side rails and around the window cutout--not much, jut enough to take off the sharp edge.

I&#39;m very happy with the result. Before it was all I could do to keep it from chirping, or at least approaching a chirp--you know that feeling that the reed is blocked up and getting ready to complain. Now I cannot get it to chirp, or even get near. Response is better overall, and the sound
 smoother at higher dynamics. Timbre may be just a bit rounder but still sounds like a buzzsaw cutting through tin.

I also decided to take down the side walls where they made an abrupt transition into the throat. I cut down the straight walls so that they make an (almost) smooth transition to the throat, and added a bit of a chamber, taking that also down to the level of the throat. 

It&#39;s a bit hard to tell what effect this had on the sound (perhaps a bit more free-blowing), but it seems to have helped with a sharp second octave, taking that down (it appears) 5-10 cents now at normal playing position for AD0. That&#39;s on the right in the pic. Again, the diamond bits left
 things a bit rough, and I will probably try to smooth out the walls a bit, but OTOH nobody can see it and it works, so I may not try to make it perfect.

All in all a couple of hours very well spent. Worth exploring this kind of mod (basically the ridge behind the tip) if you have a mpc on which you don&#39;t mind experimenting.

Benade and Nederveen, amongst others, have described both mathematically and theoretically - a sequence of closed tone holes is equivalent to a general enlargement of the bore.   If we accept Nederveen&#39;s claim that flow enters a closed tone hole up to 10% of the diameter of the tone hole, then calculating the effective enlargement is not impossible (my next project). Based on my previous volume calculations of thick resonators (they displaced an average of 18% or the tone hole chimney volume.) I estimate an effective bore volume enlargement of less than 1%.

Yes, it enlarges and lengthens the bore effectively, for which the manufacturer already compensated by placing the tone holes accordingly (reducing the length).  Double compensation should not be necessary.

Compensating for the closed tone holes is not the point.  The point is whether using the geometric measurements of the body tube (which are not the same as the acoustic measurements due to the closed tone hole lattice) would produce an accurate "missing cone".  I believe that my study shows that it does not.

Your study is an impressive work, but it also shows me that your physical neck tube has 9.35% less volume than your model, Ferron theoretical tube, of the same dimensions, from which you made your conclusions.  That discrepancy, plus your unwillingness to address it, claiming that your results are within 1% accurate, outweighs everything else in my mind.  That&#39;s just me though.  

In future similar studies, I think a great deal more needs to be made of how measurements are taken.  A caliper won&#39;t fit inside the tenon to measure the neck, so how did you measure the neck tube diameter exactly?  Did you take the tenon off?  Measure from the outside?  How far does the neck tube protrude into the tenon ring?  If you didn&#39;t take the tenon off, how did you measure the tube length?  All these things apply to the receiver and body tube, and the body/bow coupling as well.  Did you clean all residue solder from all the measuring surfaces?  If you used water to measure neck volume, describe how you stopped the end.  There&#39;s a lot of room for error there.  

Is close enough for Jazz, good enough for science?

I agree with the above statement and therein lies the humor.

You used the dimensions of your physical neck (length 173mm, radii of 
11.4mm and 6.3mm), without the tenon, to calculate the taper and the
missing cone&#39;s first instance.  Correct?

That is correct.  The formula given in Ferron&#39;s book was used to
determine the taper of the neck as 1.689 degrees.  That in turn was used
to extrapolate the length of the imaginary cone extended from the end of
the neck to its apex.  That figure was found to be 213.7 mm.

Though you did not do it, I feel compelled to compare the actual volume
of the physical neck section you used for your measurements (without
tenon) with the calculated volume of the model, Ferron neck (without
tenon).

It is true that the measured physical volume of the neck differs from
the volume of the imaginary cone calculated using that taper and base
radius minus the calculated smaller missing cone from the end of the
neck.   The reason for this is that the neck is not a perfect cone with
straight sides and an even taper throughout its length.  If you have a
better way to determine the taper of the "imperfect cone" we call a
neck, I would be interested to hear it.

The tenon and gap have a volume of just over 9cl.

A 1 mm gap between the bottom of the neck tenon and the end of its
receiver is not part of the neck.  It is a gap!

Subtracting that from your 49cl neck + tenon+ gap volume, leave
40clvolume for your curved neck tube (length 173mm, radii of  11.4mm
and6.3mm).  Your model, Ferron neck, of the same dimensions, has a
volumeof 43.74cl.  So, 3.74cl, a 9.35% difference.

Forgetting about the 1mm gap, my calculations show a difference between
the measured physical volume of the neck without the tenon (43.33 m),
and the calculated volume of the imaginary perfect truncated cone neck
(40.275 ml) to be 3.055 ml.   The volume of the neck either real or
imagined carries no significance on the outcome of finding the missing
cone, unless the neck is considered to be part of the "missing cone". 
Since it is not actually missing, but a physical part of the instrument,
I think it is a waste of time to haggle over a 3 ml difference.

You and Toby felt that the extra actual volume added by the tone holes,
would make the body tube taper model measurements inaccurate.  Do you
think that having 9.35% less actual neck volume than your model, Ferron
neck tube does the same thing?

Certainly not.  The missing cone volume derived from the body of the
saxophone was so large that the effective mouthpiece volume was still
short even when the mouthpiece was pulled completely off the cork.

There is another proof that can be linked to the findings of the study
that bears repeating.

Benade&#39;s second condition for the missing cone is that the Frequency of
the mouthpiece on its neck must be equal to the natural resonant 
frequency of the neck plus the missing cone.   Using measurements from
the study the following statements are true:

-The length of the missing cone calculated using the taper of the neck
was found to be 213.7 mm.

-The missing cone, plus the neck, plus its tenon total  407.7 mm

-On the saxophone the wavelength of a given note is 2x the physical
length of the instrument plus its end correction (.6 x radius)

-The missing cone, plus the neck, plus the tenon, plus the end
correction is  414.6.  That length times 2 = 829.2 hz

-The wavelength of Ab concert at speed of sound 345 = 831 hz

-This is the exact pitch produced on the mouthpiece and neck alone with
the mouthpiece in that position.

I would certainly welcome other studies done on this topic and would be
happy to share notes and/or measurements with anyone who is interested.

What I feel is important to remember is that whenever the saxophone
mouthpiece is pulled farther off the neck both the length and the volume
change simultaneously.   Benade makes the comparison of a saxophone
mouthpiece on its neck to the oboe reed on its staple to illustrate the
requirement that the resonant frequency of the "reed on its staple" or
Frs  needs to match the natural resonant frequency of the "extended"
missing cone defined as the reed on its staple or in the case of the
saxophone the mouthpiece on its neck.

There are some important differences to consider:

-The oboe reed cannot be moved forward and back on its staple in
ordinary conditions like the sax mouthpiece on its neck, because it is
bound to the staple with string.

-The blades of the oboe reed can be made more narrow by squeezing the
sides and/or tightening a wire around the base of the blades.  The same
saxophone mouthpiece cannot be made more narrow.

-The oboe reed&#39;s staple can be cut off and shortened.  The saxophone
neck cannot be cut without injuring the instrument.

My point is that Benade&#39;s pitch statement about oboe reeds applies only
when the length and volume can be adjusted independent of one another.  
I have a hard time accepting the application of this principle to
saxophone mouthpieces, since in practice changes in length and volume
are interdependent and occur simultaneously.


The findings of the Mouthpiece Insert Pitch Study 
&lt;http://jbtsaxmusic.homestead.com/Neck_insert_study_text_2.pdf>  are on
point to this discussion.

I believe that the results suggest that when the effective mouthpiece
volume is smaller than that of the missing cone the overall pitch is
sharp and the octaves are too wide.

The reverse of that is also true that when the equivalent mouthpiece
volume is larger than that of the missing cone, the overall pitch is
flat and the octaves are too narrow.

In this view, the length of the instrument to the tip of the mouthpiece
has no significance other than its effect to raise or lower the volume
inside the mouthpiece.   In other words the tuning and relationships of
the harmonics have everything to do with the effective volume of the
mouthpiece, and that effective volume is controlled to a large degree by
the placement of the mouthpiece on the cork.

But note that Benade specifies either a change in staple length *or a change in reed length* has the same effect: to change the pitch overall of all registers more or less equally.
 Changing the reed length (making the blades shorter or longer) is equivalent to moving the mpc on the neck of the sax.

Squeezing the reed is equivalent to changing the internal volume of the sax mpc, and this changes mode relationships.

So actually it is possible to change length and volume independent of each other on the oboe, just not in the same reed. This does not change the fundamental concepts involved.

The findings of the Mouthpiece Insert Pitch Study  are on point to this discussion. 

I believe that the results suggest that when the effective mouthpiece volume is smaller than that of the missing cone the overall pitch is sharp and the octaves are too wide.  

The reverse of that is also true that when the equivalent mouthpiece volume is larger than that of the missing cone, the overall pitch is flat and the octaves are too narrow.  

In this view, the length of the instrument to the tip of the mouthpiece has no significance other than its effect to raise or lower the volume inside the mouthpiece.   In other words the tuning and relationships of the harmonics have everything to do with the effective volume of the mouthpiece,
 and that effective volume is controlled to a large degree by the placement of the mouthpiece on the cork.

            <pre class='message__body'>Stop the presses.

I have thought of a way that we increase the effective volume inside the
mouthpiece without moving it on or off the cork. That is by increasing
or decreasing embouchure pressure on the reed.

Dr. Ray Smith at BYU who is an accomplished saxophonist in both jazz and
classical playing teaches that if your high notes are sharp---push the
mouthpiece in.  What he means of course is that often inexperienced
players play too high on the mouthpiece pitch.  As a result they pull
the mouthpiece out to get the high octave in tune.  This produces a
volume inside the mouthpiece larger than that of the missing cone and
the low register plays flat meaning the octaves are too wide.

When the mouthpiece is put farther on to the cork, it takes away the
excess volume inside the mouthpiece and then some.  The player then
adjusts by dropping the jaw, opening the oral cavity, and playing lower
on the mouthpiece pitch to get back down to AD0.   This dials in the
effective mouthpiece volume so it matches that of the missing cone, and
brings the Frs of the neck and mouthpiece down to the required frequency
and the saxophone plays in pitch and in tune with itself.

The same effects to a lesser degree occur when a harder or softer reed
is used.  Dr. Wolfe writes that going from a hard to a soft reed on the
tenor sax can increase the effective volume of the mouthpiece a couple
of milliliters.   It is beginning to make sense to me how all these
relationships work together as they apply to the saxophone.

Of course you are right about the staple.  It would never be shortened
on the cork end.  One would just wrap the reed on a shorter staple just
as a bassoonist would use a different length bocal.

I&#39;m still trying to grasp Benade&#39;s statement that:

"Enlarging or shortening the staple enlarges V total and raises Frs".  I
suppose that the only way to test this would be solder an extension on
to the end of a saxophone neck and then remove it, keeping the
mouthpiece in the same position on the cork.  Or one could use a junk
neck and cut the end off with a hacksaw.

Ok you got me.  :)  

Seriously, I had not linked lipping notes conceptually to the changes in mouthpiece volume before now.  Seeing the lipped pitch bending from this somewhat different perspective of changes in mouthpiece volume ties a lot of what Benade writes together in my mind.

On the saxophone, you ream out the mouthpiece chamber or change mouthpieces for a fatter chamber, in order to change volume independently (to some extent) of length..

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

Players tune dynamically all the time by changing embouchure pressure, which changes the Vtotal (although other effects are involved as well in &#39;lipping&#39; notes). The idea is to get the mode relationships as close as possible so that the player doesn&#39;t have to do wild mouth calisthenics to stay in
 tune.

Baroque flutes were notoriously out of tune, and players had to continuously roll the flute in and out while playing to stay on pitch. Of course this developed into an art form, but was not universally appreciated. Mozart is reported to have said that the only thing worse than a flute in the
 orchestra was two flutes in the orchestra.

Frs is going to depend on two things, the volume enclosed in the tube and the end diameter of the tube. If you shorten the tube it clearly raises Frs, as does making the end of the tube wider. 

Just as a clarification, if the cone were complete, changing the end diameter would not have that effect--no matter what the length of the cone, but since the staple (or the neck) is like a mini-conical woodwind in itself (truncated cone, not complete cone), changing the cone angle will change the
 volume requirement for the substitution (reed or mpc), and since that doesn&#39;t change the frequency of the entire system (reed/staple or mpc/neck) will change with a change in cone angle (such as enlarging the end of the staple in Benade&#39;s example).

1.  This is never done "on the fly" while playing like moving the
mouthpiece on or off the cork.

2.  Once this volume change is made, that mouthpiece will need to be set
at a different location on the cork to play in tune.

            <pre class='message__body'>I am referring more to playing at a given mouthpiece pitch rather than
lipping specific notes up or down.  If I may, I would like to bring the
discussion back to reality rather than theoretical constructs like
completed cones and what happens when you expand the end of the neck
tube.

What I would like to discuss is what conditions would meet one of
Benade&#39;s two requirements, but not the other and what the effects might
be.

For example, if the mouthpiece effective volume matched that of the
missing cone, but the Frs of the mouthpiece and neck did not match the
natural resonant frequency of the missing cone plus the neck.  Under
what circumstances might this be the case, and what would the effects
be.

Also, if the Frs of the mouthpiece and neck matched the natural resonant
frequency of the missing cone plus the neck, but the volume inside the
mouthpiece was larger or smaller than that of the missing cone.   How
would this be a possibility, and what would the effect be upon the
playing characteristics of that set up?

I suppose that the only way to test this would be solder an extension on

            <pre class='message__body'>As far as I understand it, if the Frs is too high you end up with intonation problems at high frequencies, i.e, the top of the second register and the palm notes. This seems to depend somewhat on the shape of the mpc. Fletcher and Rossing specify that to satisfy the condition of the correct
 Helmholtz resonance, the chamber of the mpc should be "somewhat bulbous" in shape, much like older mpcs. I had a look recently at an old Cmel mpc I have and found that the chamber was significantly larger than the throat. No modern mpc is like that. 

It would be eminently possible to make a high-baffle, larger chamber piece, but this seems never to be done today. It looks to me like most modern mpcs simply have a drill bit stuck up the shank to a certain depth to form the throat, leaving a sharp edge where the thick side walls and high baffle
 end. It would be much more work (especially with metal) to do this correctly, and have a chamber that was larger than the throat, since this is a reverse profile and could not be simply drilled out. Perhaps what is needed is to weld two parts together, or to make the shank oversize, drill it
 large, and then put in an insert to fit on the neck. Neither of these would look too cool, and thus would probably hurt sales...

I recently did major surgery on an alto piece because it was playing the second register sharp on my horn. I took quite a lot of metal off the bottom end of the baffle and smoothed out the abrupt transition between the side walls and the throat. You are quite right that the mpc position to tune to
 A = 440 changed (I had to push the mpc on much further), but at that position the second register no longer played sharp.

            <pre class='message__body'>Your hands on experiment appears to prove this statement by Benade, FMA
p.471

"10.  On a conical air column with only a small missing apical part, an
alteration of the reed cavity effective volume which changes the mode -1
frequency by a small percentage will produce four times as much change
in the mode-2 frequency, and nine times as much in the mode-3.  Thus a
reduction in the reed cavity volume produces a widening of the resonance
frequency ratios, while an increase in the cavity volume narrows these
ratios.  On less completer cones, the effect on the frequency ratios is
less."

And this statement by Benade, Acoustic Evolution of Wind Instruments p.
26

"As little as 3 mm shortening  [the oboe reed] will raise the overall
playing pitch of essentially the whole scale by 15 to 20 cents on a oboe
if the cooperations are in reasonably good order."


So essentially you increased the volume inside the mouthpiece which
lowered the frequency of mode 1 by x cents, and mode 2 by 4x cents which
made the mouthpiece play x cents flat at the same position on the cork,
but made the relationship of modes one and 2 better in tune.  Then you
pushed the mouthpiece farther on to the cork (shortening the reed) to
bring mode 1 back up to AD0.

The only part that is still confusing to me is that pushing the
mouthpiece in not only shortens the "length of the reed" but it also
reduces the volume in the mouthpiece cavity which according to Benade&#39;s
first quote should widen the frequency ratios making the upper register
sharp again.  Can you explain the discrepancy.

            <pre class='message__body'>John, 

Nederveen gives the math involved around pg 40. It is way beyond me. Anyway, it involves spherical wave timing. Wolfe explained it simply as follows: when the reflected wave reaches the mpc it slows down in the presence of an enlarged cavity. It is as though the compression wave takes extra time
 to bring the larger cavity to the correct pressure so that the wave can continue on to the top of the mpc. The trick is to retard the wavefront enough so that it reaches the tip of the mpc at exactly the time that wavefront would have reached the apex of the cone if the cone were complete.

Obviously this must be frequency dependent. Nederveen says: "Deviations from the preferred value of V strongly influence the high register and the upper part of the low register, whereas the lowest notes are altered less."

This seems to indicate that the mpc should initially be set for correct tuning of the lowest notes, and then taken from there. However this assumes that the lower notes on a given instrument are correctly intonated, which is hardly always the case. If the maker has "adjusted" the low notes (based
 on a given scale or mpc or style of mpc or playing) then this is hardly a good idea.

I digress...

This much is clear. The problem is that Benade does not make exactly clear the relationship between the effect of length and the effect of volume. He says that either shortening the staple OR shortening the reed itself will result in raising the frequencies more or less equally, but as you point
 out, these involve two different things. Shortening the reed lessens cavity volume as well as overall length, while shortening the staple leaves the cavity volume the same while shortening the truncated cone. 

My guess is that shortening the staple and shortening the reed by the same amount would not result in exactly the same intonation effect, but it appears that the most important factor is shortening the overall length of the instrument, and that the specific effects of shortening either the cone or
 the reed are small enough that Benade ignores the distinction.

In isolation, then, it appears that simply shortening the length without changing the volume would result in the first mode rising in pitch more than the second.

Back to my experiment: The first step is enlarging the mpc volume. This drops the second register more than the first, but both are lowered when the mpc is at the same position on the cork. 

The important point here is that I take out enough metal so that the second mode is now significantly flatter than the first mode, although now both are flat at the original mpc position  

Now we inch the mpc more onto the neck, shortening the instrument. This has two effects. First it raises both modes more or less equally because the length is being shortened. Second, since the volume is also decreasing, the second mode is rising faster than the first. 

The trick is to have flattened the second mode enough that although it is rising faster than the first, a point of coincidence is reached when the first mode reaches concert pitch.

So we have to balance volume (less volume makes the second mode sharper than the first) with length (less length makes the second mode flatter than the first).

That&#39;s my guess as to how it works, based on Benade&#39;s statements and my own experience (which is hardly a rigorous proof, however).

But there is a huge fly in the ointment here, as regards what I think I observed. 

I just spent some time trying to get some accurate measurements of length and volume as relate to intonation. The fact is that this seems near impossible due to the great variations in intonation possible with very small shifts in embouchure position and lip pressure.

I found that I could tune first octave G within a range of about 4 mm on the neck with slightly different emboucure parameters, but this had a large effect on the tuning of second octave G. Beyond that, slight changes in embouchre affected second octave G tuning much more than first octave G.

Of course we know all that, but it has profound consequences in trying to get a handle on all this, and I don&#39;t want to mislead you. It is possible that at least some of the effect that I reported in my experiment has to do with changes in my embouchure position. Unfortunately I did not measure
 the internal volume or length before the modification of the Runyon, so I can&#39;t post A/B results,.

For instance, I tried to carefully measure the tuning of two different alto mpcs, a Beechler Bellite and a Vandoren A35. The Bellite is high baffle, whereas the Vandoren is more or less classical with a rather low baffle. 

The tip openings are quite similar. I found that the Beechler tuned at a length of about 66 mm from end of neck to tip rail while the Vandoren tuned at 61 mm. The measured volumes were different: the Beechler (at that position) had an internal volume around 8.5 ml, while the Vandoren was around
 9.5 ml. I stress that all these measurements are approximate, and the average of a number of different tries, in which I found the correct position to vary +-2 mm or so. In any case the same reed was used and because the tip openings are similar no great embouchure variations were needed to blow
 both comfortably.

But the trend seems to be that the longer mpc needed less internal volume to tune to concert pitch, but with a caveat: the Beechler consistently played the second octave G significantly sharper than the Vandoren, by 10-15 cents. 

This seems to bear out the thought that a shorter, fatter mpc will bring the higher modes down somewhat, and would then explain why by reaming out the chamber of my Runyon, it brought the octaves into line even though the mpc was pushed further on the neck, reducing the internal volume somewhat
 (if my observations are correct).

Although it is hard to quantify this, because of wide variations due to temperature variations and embouchure and blowing factors, it does seem to bear out Benade&#39;s points as concern length vs. volume in conical instruments.

A good further step, to really control factors here, would be to take two identical mpcs and significantly change the chamber volume on one, leaving the other alone. Then do A/B comparisons of correct tuning length from tip to end of the neck, corresponding internal volumes and mode relationships
 when the lower mode is in tune.

Bear in mind that since small embouchure variations can make a big difference, you would either have to use an artificial embouchure or do a wide number of trials to get decent statistical results.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

I would submit that what John is mentioning is not what most guys mean or are doing when they talking about "lipping" notes in tune. "Lipping" is often a fairly large embouchure adjustment in order to fix intonation on individual notes. However, players who do this very much have general trouble with intonation. One has less trouble with intonation when the embouchure is generally quite relaxed, and the oral tract does the adjusting by way of "voicing" the notes. This approach to playing works well with the recommendation that John cites: a mpc that is pushed fairly far onto the cork, and a relaxed embouchure that plays "down" to pitch. This is not the equivalent of "lipping" on individual notes, which often means "lipping up", i.e. biting.

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually it doesn&#39;t appear that the vocal tract can do anything about intonation at all. There was speculation that since the vocal tract is an upstream resonator it might be possible to "tune" it to a significant frequency of a note being played and affect the way the reed vibrates, but recent
 research has shown that this does not happen until the altissimo notes. Wolfe et al. at UNSW did a well-received study on this and found that neither professional players nor amateurs alter the vocal tract in any consistent way UNTIL the altissimo range, where it is absolutely essential to shape
 the vocal tract in such a way that it has a resonant frequency equal to a significant frequency of the altissimo note in question. All the pro players did this kind of shaping; amateurs unable to do so could not play altissimo.

I can give you the link if you are interested--or it is pretty obviously available on the UNSW site.

As I mentioned in my mpc experiment, I was surprised at how much I could lip notes with only very minor embouchure changes. Not so much in the first octave, and especially not so much at the low end of the first octave, but in the middle of the second octave I could, with minor embouchure changes,
 lip a note up or down 40 cents.

The big problem with lipping notes is that you can&#39;t lip all the notes equally;  it&#39;s easier to lip both higher and shorter-tube notes (generally, and at least within the first two octaves). This means that you want to generally be in tune for the notes harder to lip, and not have to do much for
 the notes easier to lip (but at least you can if necessary).

The big problem comes when you have a mouthpiece whose specs are out of whack, or if your general embouchure tension (either too tight or too loose) throws those octaves out. In either case, there is no way to get all the notes in tune with generally the same embouchure. Of course if you have a
 horn that is also out of tune with itself the same applies.

This is why beginning players sound so horrible in terms of intonation--they are playing each note with a fixed embouchure, having not acquired the skill to vary the pitch dynamically according to need. This is similar to beginning violin players, who don&#39;t yet know exactly the  finger positions
 needed to achieve correct pitch on various notes. Violin players, with long practice, gain the skill to know generally where to put their fingers, and--importantly--how to get spot on quickly when they are in the neighborhood. Sax players, with long practice, learn the best general embouchure to
 achieve a good sound, and how to quickly and seamlessly adjust their bite on the reed to center the pitch of each note.

You have been doing this so long that it is unconscious, and you probably think that you are adjusting you vocal tract, but what you are really doing is transposing your feeling of singing with the horn into an incredibly complex series of fine adjustments of lip tension and shape and bite on the
 mpc, coupled with synchronous modulation of breath pressure, to play a note with a certain color, a certain dynamic and a certain pitch, not to mention that you are varying all of these all the time in the name of artistry and expression.

I submit that the ever-present, tube resonance of the mouthpiece + constriction (I&#39;ll call it the mc resonance), which creates the hole in the saxophone spectrum, giving the saxophone it&#39;s characteristic sound, (see, http://www.acoustics.org/press/151st/Dalmont.html) plays an important roll in "voicing" notes.  Having a short wavelength, ("e.g. the second mode frequency of the shortest used tube." - Benade),  it would be more influenced by the effective volume manipulations of the vocal tract than a good portion of the regime forming resonances of the normal range.  It&#39;s conceivable, that most regimes would have at least one resonance with a node in the vicinity of .the mc resonance&#39;s displacement anti-node (just inside the neck opening), and the unsuspecting regime resonance would suffer pitch and perhaps amplitude altering interference from mc (thus the spectrum hole).  Vocal tract manipulation is used to move the position of mc&#39;s displacement
 anti-node far enough away from the regime&#39;s resonance in order avoid it&#39;s interference with the sounding regime.

Vocal tract manipulations don&#39;t alter pitch per se.  They alter modal alignment (frequency) in the higher frequencies which result in amplitude ratio changes in the regime and perhaps very minor pitch changes in the fundamental as a result of the regime adjusting to maximize acoustic energy.

Wolfe was rather unequivocal on this point (Zt is vocal tract impedance and Zb is bore impedance): 

"Over the lower range of the instrument, the peaks in Zb are much greater than those in Zt. In this range, the peaks in Zt
varied greatly among players, and showed no consistent
relation to the note played. In the high ($B!H(Baltissimo$B!I(B) range, however, the professional players consistently tuned a strong peak in Zt near to or slightly above the fundamental of the note played ."

I submit that the ever-present, tube resonance of the mouthpiece + constriction (I&#39;ll call it the mc resonance), which creates the hole in the saxophone spectrum, giving the saxophone it&#39;s characteristic sound, (see, http://www.acoustics.org/press/151st/Dalmont.html) plays an important roll in
 "voicing" notes.  Having a short wavelength, ("e.g. the second mode frequency of the shortest used tube." - Benade),  it would be more influenced by the effective volume manipulations of the vocal tract than a good portion of the regime forming resonances of the normal range.  It&#39;s conceivable,
 that most regimes would have at least one resonance with a node in the vicinity of .the mc resonance&#39;s displacement anti-node (just inside the neck opening), and the unsuspecting regime resonance would suffer pitch  and perhaps amplitude altering interference from mc (thus the spectrum hole). 
 Vocal tract manipulation is used to move the position of mc&#39;s displacement anti-node far enough away from the regime&#39;s resonance in order avoid it&#39;s interference with the sounding regime.

Vocal tract manipulations don&#39;t alter pitch per se.  They alter modal alignment (frequency) in the higher frequencies which result in amplitude ratio changes in the regime and perhaps very minor pitch changes in the fundamental as a result of the regime adjusting to maximize acoustic energy.

OK, OK. But the point is that you can probably find two same brand, same opening mpcs that play the same frequency when they are at the same point on the neck, and whose mode relations are generally the same within a few cents. That is certainly close enough to have a control for comparison when you alter one.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a much different view based upon my experience.  I think Dr.
Wolfe&#39;s finding that players don&#39;t adjust their vocal tracts in any
consistent way when playing below the altissimo range, should not be
interpreted to mean that they don&#39;t use vocal tract settings or
adjustments when they play the normal range of the saxophone.

Some examples come to mind:

-First there is the well known mouthpiece exercise in which the goal is
to master a complete scale on the mouthpiece alone without making
significant changes with the lip pressure.  This involves changing the
pitch using the vocal tract almost exclusively.  Once this technique is
mastered it of course facilitates the mastery of playing overtones and
notes in the altissimo range, but just as important it allows the player
to "voice" notes in the normal playing range of the instrument.  This
voicing has both the purpose of changing the "timbre" of any given note,
but also it&#39;s pitch.

An exercise I have successfully used with my students is to have them
drop the pitch of a very sharp 4th line D to where it is way too flat by
dropping the jaw and opening the oral cavity and then bring the pitch
back up to be in tune by re-tightening the lips and keeping the jaw and
oral cavity the same.  Sharp notes just "lipped" down often have a
"flabby" tone.  By lowering the pitch "vocally" instead, the tone
quality is maintained.

-Another pedagogical tool also applies, and that is "tuning the
airstream" using the shape of the mouth and throat.  This works
especially well when teaching brass and flute tone production, but it is
also effective on sax and clarinet.  The process is simply to hum the
pitch of the note you are going to play and then blow that pitch on an
airstream.  It sounds like an airy whistle.  Then when the note is
played using that air velocity and shape of the oral cavity, the pitch
and focus of the tone are excellent.  It produces what is referred to as
a "well centered tone".

It is true that a player does not have time to make this focus
adjustment for each note when the notes change rapidly,  but when
playing a slow sustained passage  it is an effective means of
controlling the quality of the tone and intonation.

My last point is that young saxophone players when equipped with a
saxophone that plays well in tune like the YAS 23 and taught to play the
correct pitch on the mouthpiece and neck (Ab concert for the alto) will
have very good intonation the range of the saxophone using the same
embouchure pressure throughout.

"Lipping" is often a fairly large embouchure adjustment in order to fix
intonation on individual notes. However, players who do this very much
have general trouble

You have given far too much information for me to digest in one sitting so I&#39;ll have to wait to respond to some of your points.

That said, I have access to literally scores of identical mouthpieces that have been replaced due to bite marks etc. but are in otherwise excellent playing condition.

Measuring the effects of mouthpiece volume changes will be one of the first tests done with the artificial embouchure device, affectionately named "deep throat" following a suggestion by one of Keith&#39;s forum members.

alignments in the higher frequencies?"

Logic.   

If these statements are true:

1. The effective volume of the mouthpiece chamber includes a portion of the vocal tract.
2. Length remaining unaltered, changes in mouthpiece volume affect the frs of the mouthpiece/constriction resonance.
3. Frs is an adjustment for the alignment of higher frequency resonances.

- then, vocal tract alterations will alter mode alignment of higher frequency resonances.

"I can see no reason why vocal tract alterations would affect the timing
of the reed, which is a function of the truncation ratio."

Close, but not exactly so.  The truncation ratio is a mechanical absolute. Reed closed  timing is controlled by the mouthpiece/constriction resonance frs. The frs of the mouthpiece/constriction resonance is a function of the mouthpiece effective volume and length, and the constriction length and diameter, which for optimal acoustical results, should match the frequency of the theoretical missing cone.

I have not done an exhaustive search yet.  Fletcher touched on it somewhere, as have a few others.  Nederveen explains the reed closure period and resultant acoustical power differences compared to cylindrical instruments.  It is what Dalmont calls the "anti-formant" and if the mouthpiece/constriction frs were correct, would be found at the neck opening, where the bore starts to expand, I would say.  

I have gone over with Toby without resolution, the idea that it is exactly this resonance that Benade refers to when discussing the frs of the substitution - ( paraphrased) the body will see a something that acoustically resembles the missing cone.  There will be a pressure node (the mouthpiece/constriction resonance&#39;s displacement anti-node) at or slightly inside the mouthpiece shank (he actually refers to an oboe staple) for played tones above frs, and moving slightly inside the neck (oboe body) for played tones below frs.  Though Dalmont states that the anti-formant freq. exists independent of the note played, Benade states that the mc resonance disp, anti-node affects played resonances with nodes in it&#39;s area.  I surmise that the reverse is also true to some extent, which would explain the nodes movement from just inside the shank to just inside the neck.

I have not done a thorough search of the UNSW site.

And I see Toby&#39;s point clearly, and in the end, it doesn&#39;t matter, as the results of matching the mc resonance frs or the mouthpiece + neck frs, are for our purposes about the same.

 I would recommend using a single large chamber mouthpiece with a removable baffle insert.  This gives you two test points that are fairly repeatable and identical except for chamber volume and baffle.

    OK, OK. But the point is that you can probably find two same brand, same opening mpcs that play the same frequency when they are at the same point on the neck, and whose mode relations are generally the same within a few cents. That is certainly close enough to have a control for comparison
 when you alter one.

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

This is mostly apples and oranges. If you look at was Wolfe is saying, it is that the impedance of the bore is so much more powerful than the impedance of the vocal tract in the normal range, that the latter can barely influence the former. If you take the mpc off the horn there is no more bore
 impedance and of course the vocal tract has a much larger effect.

The pedagogical tools are just that: a way of visualizing something that is actually something else. I&#39;ve done some personal experiments and find that vocal tract manipulations have near zero (if not zero) effect on the tone *if I keep my embouchure the same*. However changing the vocal tract by
 visualizing the note, or even "singing" the note to align the resonance, has a lot to do about fine optimization of the embouchure and almost nothing to do with the upstream resonator contributing anything to the sound, at least in woodwinds. The different kind of reed in brasses make it a
 different proposition in that case, as the vocal tract can influence vibration of the lips. A hard cane reed is a different matter.

I think Dr. Wolfe&#39;s finding that players don&#39;t adjust their vocal tracts in any consistent way when playing below the altissimo range, should not be interpreted to
 mean that they don&#39;t use vocal tract settings or adjustments when they play the normal range of the saxophone.

Some examples come to mind:  

-First there is the well known mouthpiece exercise in which the goal is to master a complete scale on the mouthpiece alone without making significant changes with the lip pressure.  This involves changing the pitch using the vocal tract almost exclusively.  Once this technique is mastered it of
 course facilitates the mastery of playing overtones and notes in the altissimo range, but just as important it allows the player to "voice" notes in the normal playing range of the instrument.  This voicing has both the purpose of changing the "timbre" of any given note, but also it&#39;s pitch.   

An exercise I have successfully used with my students is to have them drop the pitch of a very sharp 4th line D to where it is way too flat by dropping the jaw and opening the oral cavity and then bring the pitch back up to be in tune by re-tightening the lips and keeping the jaw and oral cavity
 the same.  Sharp notes just "lipped" down often have a "flabby" tone.  By lowering the pitch "vocally" instead, the tone quality is maintained.

-Another pedagogical tool also applies, and that is "tuning the airstream" using the shape of the mouth and throat.  This works especially well when teaching brass and flute tone production, but it is also effective on sax and clarinet.  The process is simply to hum the pitch of the note you are
 going to play and then blow that pitch on an airstream.  It sounds like an airy whistle.  Then when the note is played using that air velocity and shape of the oral cavity, the pitch and focus of the tone are excellent.  It produces what is referred to as a "well centered tone".

It is true that a player does not have time to make this focus adjustment for each note when the notes change rapidly,  but when playing a slow sustained passage  it is an effective means of controlling the quality of the tone and intonation.

My last point is that young saxophone players when equipped with a saxophone that plays well in tune like the YAS 23 and taught to play the correct pitch on the mouthpiece and neck (Ab concert for the alto) will have very good intonation the range of the saxophone using the same embouchure
 pressure throughout.

I think it is true that vocal tract resonances can somewhat change the timbre of played notes, if they are aligned with a specific strong peak in the note, but that is something different from changing the actual pitch.

Here is Wolfe&#39;s conclusion:

"We conclude that the vocal tract resonances have only modest effects on the sounding pitch over much of the instrument$B!G(Bs range. However, to play notes in the altissimo range, players learn to tune a resonance of the tract near to the note to be played."

OK, modest effects are still effects, but his research showed that professional players are all over the map, and do not tune their vocal tract resonances to the playing frequencies except in altissimos.

Logic.   

If these statements are true:

1. The effective volume of the mouthpiece chamber includes a portion of the vocal tract.
2. Length remaining unaltered, changes in mouthpiece volume affect the frs of the mouthpiece/constriction resonance.
3. Frs is an adjustment for the alignment of higher frequency resonances.

- then, vocal tract alterations will alter mode alignment of higher frequency resonances.

"I can see no reason why vocal tract alterations would affect the timing of the reed, which is a function of the truncation ratio."

Close, but not exactly so.  The truncation ratio is a mechanical absolute. Reed closed  timing is controlled by the mouthpiece/constriction resonance frs. The frs of the mouthpiece/constriction resonance is a function of the mouthpiece effective volume and length, and the constriction length and
 diameter, which for optimal acoustical results, should match the frequency of the theoretical missing cone.

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t want to exhume corpses, but Dalmont&#39;s statement clearly says that the antiformant is at Nf1, where N is the inverse of the truncation ratio and is independent of the played note. This is totally different from what Benade is talking about.

In terms of Benade&#39;s node and its movement--this is clear, I think, if you consider the following: Playing the substitution and constriction apart from the main body of the instrument--let&#39;s say the oboe reed on its staple--results in a pressure node at the end of the staple tube. This should be
 obvious, because the oboe reed and staple is a mini-woodwind in its own right, and the end of the staple is the end of the mini-body tube. So the tube has a certain length and with the reed beating (ignoring reed effects for the moment) that has a certain frequency. This is Frs. I&#39;m pretty sure
 we are all on the same page here.

Now let&#39;s look at what Benade is saying:

"We can continue our search for a useful imitation of the missing part of the cone by trying the effect of matching Frs for the reed system to the first-mode natural frequency of the cone apex itself."

--So the point of the exercise is to make sure that the resonance frequency of the reed/staple (or mpc/neck) is the same as that of the missing part of the cone. One thing that it is vital to understand is that if we are measuring the Frs of the mpc plus the neck, the missing cone consists of
 everything from the tenon up, NOT just from the end of the neck. This, I believe is the source of confusion, and stems from a misunderstanding about oboe reeds. The staple is analogous to the neck of the sax; it is not analogous to the mpc chamber. If this is understood the rest becomes clear.
 Benade continues:

"In the general frequency neighborhood of Frs the oboe will then &#39;see&#39; an object at its upper end whose acoustical behavior is quite similar to the missing apical cone."

--Translated for sax, this becomes the main body tube seeing an object (mpc + neck) looking like the apical tip. Remember that the analog of the oboe reed + staple is the mpc + neck, not just the mpc.

"In particular, there will be a pressure node in the neighborhood of the junction of the main bore with the reed staple [same as sax neck-toby], lying a little inside the staple at frequencies somewhat above Frs and moving down below the junction at oboe playing frequencies below Frs--behavior
 that is identical with that found in an ideal cone. "[my emphasis]

--He is talking about the oboe playing the actual oboe note with the same frequency as Frs. Now since the oboe reed plus staple is much shorter than the tube length of any note in the first mode, this has to be the oboe playing a note and using the octave key. This means that the player plays
 whatever note at which the air column is twice the length of the reed + staple, and then cuts the frequency in half with the octave key. In f1 mode, there is a pressure node for this note (as with any note) at the first open hole. But this note is chosen so that the air column is twice the length
 of reed/staple.  And thus in f2 there is a second pressure node exactly halfway, right? That is exactly at the point where the staple meets the body--and that is why he specifies that this behavior is identical with that found in an ideal cone. Then, when the oboe plays higher and the wave is
 shorter, it moves up a bit into the staple, and why when the oboe plays lower and the wave is longer, it moves down into the body. This is nothing more nor less than the normal tube-midpoint pressure node in any f2 note. The whole point of the exercise is only to show that the mpc+neck, if
 correctly designed, should act exactly as the complete cone, in that the wave should have nodes at the correct points in the air column when the piece for which we measured Frs is joined to the whole air column (or at least for the second mode, so that the octaves are in tune. We don&#39;t overblow
 the third octave directly so it can do what it likes).

So translating for sax, this means that the sax playing note which is the same as the note sounding with mpc/neck blown off the body (Frs), should have a pressure node exactly at the bottom of the tenon, and it will move up into the neck as the sax plays higher and the waves get shorter, and vice
 versa. It NEVER gets anywhere near the shank of the mpc at any playing frequency, except perhaps in the highest altissimos.

Here is an example. My mpc frequency alone is Bb4, with neck around Ab3. That latter corresponds to fingered F with octave key. So according to Benade--if the mpc/neck is acting correctly--this would mean that the pressure node would not get up to the end of the neck until I was playing an
 altissimo G, and would not actually get into the shank of the mpc until altissimo Bb or so.

I hope this is finally clear.

I have not done an exhaustive search yet.  Fletcher touched on it somewhere, as have a few others.  Nederveen explains the reed closure period and resultant acoustical power differences compared to cylindrical instruments.  It is what Dalmont calls the "anti-formant" and if the
 mouthpiece/constriction frs were correct, would be found at the neck opening, where the bore starts to expand, I would say.  

I have gone over with Toby without resolution, the idea that it is exactly this resonance that Benade refers to when discussing the frs of the substitution - ( paraphrased) the body will see a something that acoustically resembles the missing cone.  There will be a pressure node (the
 mouthpiece/constriction resonance&#39;s displacement  anti-node) at or slightly inside the mouthpiece shank (he actually refers to an oboe staple) for played tones above frs, and moving slightly inside the neck (oboe body) for played tones below frs.  Though Dalmont states that the anti-formant freq.
 exists independent of the note played, Benade states that the mc resonance disp, anti-node affects played resonances with nodes in it&#39;s area.  I surmise that the reverse is also true to some extent, which would explain the nodes movement from just inside the shank to just inside the neck.

I have not done a thorough search of the UNSW site.

I agree that VT changes are generally not effective as pitch adjustments.   Timbral and response adjustments are a different matter however, and the degree that they become evident to the player, is directly related to his/her level of artistic development.  From the school of fine clarinet playing, saxophonist have adopted the practice of lowering and extending the jaw, until the joints "pop" out of their socket, maximizing the volume of the mouth cavity and opening the soft pallet, to incorporate the sinuses.  The results are clearly heard and felt, and can not be attributed to any slight change in embouchure.

One must arch the tongue in the back of the mouth in order to get optimal tone and response in the upper (normal) register.

The same can be said for low register playing, especially tenor and baritone.  There are just certain things that one must do in the vocal tract, which are not a result of embouchure changes, to get each note to respond, and sound, optimally.   For me, there&#39;s almost nothing worse than the sound of someone playing a low C on tenor, who doesn&#39;t know where to put his tongue after articulating the note.

In this multi-part sax clinic, Frank Catalano, demonstrates some impressive things one can do by.manipulating the vocal tract:

            <pre class='message__body'>This is certainly abundantly true as concerns the flute. All side-blown flutes have a cavity above the embouchure hole for tuning the high notes (and this is actually analogous in many ways to the whole concept of getting the Frs of a mpc correct to tune the high register of the sax). The
 Helmholtz resonance of this little chamber acts the same as the sax antiformant, almost cancelling paritals in its neighborhood.

The import of this did not become clear to me until I picked up my Okuralo, which is really a standard metal Boehm flute with a shakuhachi-type, endblown head. This instrument came with a standard Boehm head as well, and the difference in timbre is extremely marked. The normal flute sounds
 "hollow" compared to the end-blown version. And it is NOT a subtle difference.

However without the tuning chamber, the Okuralo, like all endblown flutes, becomes hopelessly sharp in the third octave....sigh....

            <pre class='message__body'>As I posted,  Your statements are clear.

Dalmont&#39;s statement of the mouthpiece/constriction resonance&#39;s independence is accurate in the big picture, but, as Benade states that the same resonance affects the equally independent resonances of the sounding regime, one can only assume that the reverse would also true, to some extent.  Clearly however, the gross frs of the mc resonance is not dependent upon the note being played.

      I don&#39;t want to exhume corpses, but Dalmont&#39;s statement clearly says that the antiformant is at Nf1, where N is the inverse of the truncation ratio and is independent of the played note. This is totally different from what Benade is talking about.



In terms of Benade&#39;s node and its movement--this is clear, I think, if you consider the following: Playing the substitution and constriction apart from the main body of the instrument-- let&#39;s say the oboe reed on its staple--results in a pressure node at the end of the staple tube. This should be
 obvious, because the oboe reed and staple is a mini-woodwind in its own right, and the end of the staple is the end of the mini-body tube. So the tube has a certain length and with the reed beating (ignoring reed effects for the moment) that has a certain frequency. This is Frs. I&#39;m pretty sure
 we are all on the same page here.



Now let&#39;s look at what Benade is saying:



"We can continue our search for a useful imitation of the missing part of the cone by trying the effect of matching Frs for the reed system to the first-mode natural frequency of the cone apex itself."



--So the point of the exercise is to make sure that the resonance frequency of the reed/staple (or mpc/neck) is the same as that of the missing part of the cone. One thing that it is vital to understand is that if we are measuring the Frs of the mpc plus the neck, the missing cone consists of
 everything from the tenon up, NOT just from the end of the neck. This, I believe is the source of confusion, and stems from a misunderstanding about oboe reeds. The staple is analogous to the neck of the sax; it is not analogous to the mpc chamber. If this is understood the rest becomes clear.
 Benade continues:



"In the general frequency neighborhood of Frs the oboe will then &#39;see&#39; an object at its upper end whose acoustical behavior is quite similar to the missing apical cone."



--Translated for sax, this becomes the main body tube seeing an object (mpc + neck) looking like the apical tip. Remember that the analog of the oboe reed + staple is the mpc + neck, not just the mpc.



"In particular, there will be a pressure node in the neighborhood of the junction of the main bore with the reed staple [same as sax neck-toby], lying a little inside the staple at frequencies somewhat above Frs and moving down below the junction at oboe playing frequencies below Frs--behavior that is identical with that found in an ideal cone. "[my emphasis]



--He is talking about the oboe playing the actual oboe note with the same frequency as Frs. Now since the oboe reed plus staple is much shorter than the tube length of any note in the first mode, this has to be the oboe playing a note and using the octave key. This means that the player plays
 whatever note at which the air column is twice the length of the reed + staple, and then cuts the frequency in half with the octave key. In f1 mode, there is a pressure node for this note (as with any note) at the first open hole. But this note is chosen so that the air column is twice the length
 of reed/staple.  And thus in f2 there is a second pressure node exactly halfway, right? That is exactly at the point where the staple meets the body--and that is why he specifies that this behavior is identical with that found in an ideal
 cone. Then, when the oboe plays higher and the wave is shorter, it moves up a bit into the staple, and why when the oboe plays lower and the wave is longer, it moves down into the body. This is nothing more nor less than the normal tube-midpoint pressure node in any f2 note. The whole point of
 the exercise is only to show that the mpc+neck, if correctly designed, should act exactly as the complete cone, in that the wave should have nodes at the correct points in the air column when the piece for which we measured Frs is joined to the whole air column (or at least for the second mode,
 so that the octaves are in tune. We don&#39;t overblow the third octave directly so it can do what it likes).



So translating for sax, this means that the sax playing note which is the same as the note sounding with mpc/neck blown off the body (Frs), should have a pressure node exactly at the bottom of the tenon, and it will move up into the neck as the sax plays higher and the waves get shorter, and vice
 versa. It NEVER gets anywhere near the shank of the mpc at any playing frequency, except perhaps in the highest altissimos.



Here is an example. My mpc frequency alone is Bb4, with neck around Ab3. That latter corresponds to fingered F with octave key. So according to Benade--if the mpc/neck is acting correctly--this would mean that the pressure node would not get up to the end of the neck until I was playing an
 altissimo G, and would not actually get into the shank of the mpc until altissimo Bb or so.



I hope this is finally clear.

I have not done an exhaustive search yet.  Fletcher touched on it somewhere, as have a few others.  Nederveen explains the reed closure period and resultant acoustical power differences compared to cylindrical instruments.  It is what Dalmont calls the "anti-formant" and if the
 mouthpiece/constric tion frs were correct, would be found at the neck opening, where the bore starts to expand, I would say.  



I have gone over with Toby without resolution, the idea that it is exactly this resonance that Benade refers to when discussing the frs of the substitution - ( paraphrased) the body will see a something that acoustically resembles the missing cone.  There will be a pressure node (the
 mouthpiece/constric tion resonance&#39;s displacement  anti-node) at or slightly inside the mouthpiece shank (he actually refers to an oboe staple) for played tones above frs, and moving slightly inside the neck (oboe body) for played tones below frs.  Though Dalmont states that the
 anti-formant freq. exists independent of the note played, Benade states that the mc resonance disp, anti-node affects played resonances with nodes in it&#39;s area.  I surmise that the reverse is also true to some extent, which would explain the nodes movement from just inside the shank to just
 inside the neck.



I have not done a thorough search of the UNSW site.

            <pre class='message__body'>Great playing. It is certainly interesting that in Wolfe&#39;s experiment there was no consistent optimization of the vocal tract resonances among the pro players he tested. Perhaps that is part of the difference in sound between different players.

I agree that VT changes are generally not effective as pitch adjustments.   Timbral and response adjustments are a different matter however, and the degree that they become evident to the player, is directly related to his/her level of artistic development.  From the school of fine clarinet
 playing, saxophonist have adopted the practice of lowering and extending the jaw, until the joints "pop" out of their socket, maximizing the volume of the mouth cavity and opening  the soft pallet, to incorporate the sinuses.  The results are clearly heard and felt, and can not be attributed to
 any slight change in embouchure.

One must arch the tongue in the back of the mouth in order to get optimal tone and response in the upper (normal) register.

The same can be said for low register playing, especially tenor and baritone.  There are just certain things that one must do in the vocal tract, which are not a result of embouchure changes, to get each note to respond, and sound, optimally.   For me, there&#39;s almost nothing worse than the sound
 of someone playing a low C on tenor, who doesn&#39;t know where to put his tongue after articulating the note.

In this multi-part sax clinic, Frank Catalano, demonstrates some impressive things one can do by.manipulating the vocal tract:

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry, I answered the first post before looking at the second. 

It appears that the whole point of getting the resonance correct is so that this exerts some influence on higher partials which would otherwise be mistimed and therefore out of tune due to the shape of the mpc. I&#39;m not sure just how much this actually changes the height of the peaks.

BTW--as to vocal tract manipulations--I find it impossible to keep the same embouchure if I change my jaw position or throat shape (which also involves the jaw). This might really be an excellent experiment for John&#39;s "deep lips" artificial embouchure. You could put very different shapes upstream
 of the embouchure itself while keeping the position and tension on the reed absolutely stable. Thus it would be easy to isolate the effects that are always interdependent with human players.

The junction of the main bore (of the oboe) with the reed staple is at
the bottom of the staple the reed is attached to---not the top. 
Therefore the pressure node of the frequencies just above Frs (the
frequency of the reed combined with its staple) will still be just
inside the cork end of the staple.  The frequencies just below Frs will
go just beyond that down into the body of the oboe itself.

The counterpart in an alto sax is the frequency produced by the
mouthpiece and neck apart from the body of the saxophone  which is very
close to Ab concert (written F).  The pressure node of the frequency
just above that pitch, F# for example, when played on the complete sax
will be found just up inside the neck tenon.  The pressure node of the
frequency just below that pitch, an E natural will be slightly past the
bottom of the neck receiver into the body of the sax.

This Ab concert would be the note sounded if the cone to its apex added
to the complete neck could produce its resonant frequency.  When the
mouthpiece substitutes for the missing cone by matching its volume, the
mouthpiece plus the complete neck produces this frequency.  When the Frs
- frequency of the reed on its staple or frequency of the sax mouthpiece
on its neck is the same as the pitch that would be produced by the
missing cone, if it could---the body of the instrument is "fooled" into
thinking the cone is complete and behaves accordingly.  This is exactly
the effect Benade describes in all of his writings on this topic.  On
this point he is very clear.

Benade also uses the term "constricted tube" to describe the staple,
bocal, and sax neck as well as the term "constriction".  There is also a
"point of constriction" at the opening of each of these that as you know
has a strong effect upon the production of the soundwave inside the
mouthpiece.  But when Benade uses the term "cavity plus constriction",
he is clearly referring to the mouthpiece and the entire neck.

I hope this helps to clarify these topics in our discussions, in order
to move forward instead of just going around in the same circles and
getting nowhere.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

I suppose we will just have to agree to disagree on this point.  Have you ever tried playing your saxophone using different vowel sound shapes with the mouth and tongue keeping the lips the same?  You can tongue DAE DEE DIE DOH DOO and get five different colors of sound.  Another test is to take the same reed, mouthpiece, and saxophone and have several advanced players play on the same set-up.  They will each sound different due to the natural differences in the size and shape of their vocal tracts and how they use shape that space when they play.

It is also important to remember that the working part of the mouthpiece is inside the mouth in the "upstream" as they call it.

As I wrote to Lance, it may well be that the timbre can be altered significantly, though not the pitch. I find it impossible to change vowel sounds in my throat without moving my jaw, and this will change all the embouchure parameters for sure. As I wrote, I think this is the perfect experiment
 for your artificial embouchure. You could have chambers of different shapes and sizes attached to the mechanical lips, or even something like a rubber ball that could be squeezed to change the shape, without affecting the tension on the reed one whit. This would very effectively isolate what is
 happening because of the resonator from what is happening because of the lips and teeth.

John,

Thanks very much for your explanation.  I understand exactly what you mean - crystal, only I do not agree, bear with me and I&#39;ll explain why.

1. Benade&#39;s diagram and description of a conical instrument&#39;s parts, which we all are familiar with - a truncated tube, and the substitution for the truncation - a cavity and a constriction.  This is perfectly clear and universally applicable.

2. The existence of a one-piece, straight sided, soprano saxophone, which according to Nederveen, would be an acoustically superior saxophone design, were only the truncation ratio reduced somewhat.  With a  cross-sectional view of it&#39;s bore, fitted with an Otto Link STM mouthpiece, .we can clearly see each section Benade described in # 1. - the cavity of the Link mouthpiece, the constriction of the mouthpiece&#39;s bore caused by the smaller opening of the body&#39;s bore. (the fact that it has no measurable length is unimportant. Play your mouthpiece alone, and then constrict the opening by covering 1/4 of it with a sheet of paper.  The pitch will drop noticeably, even though the paper is very, very thin.  The length of the constriction is unimportant.  Only the diameter is important.), and finally, the truncated, one-piece, straight sided body.  The meaning of anything Benade ever wrote about the saxophone is easily understood by applying it to this
 essential model.  Some statements require qualification, but are easy to understand when we remember that he sometimes addressed acoustical issues with mechanical convenience in mind, rather than complete acoustical accuracy, but all of his statements apply to this model, as they must.

3. In order to clarify Benade&#39;s nebulous statements, I emailed Dr. Joe Wolfe, and asked him to explain, just what constituted the substitution for the missing cone, the mouthpiece volume, or the mouthpiece volume + the neck volume.  His reply was, mouthpiece + reed compliance.  OK.  That is substantiated by #1 and #2.  So, without question, the neck is not part of the substitution.  The neck is body volume and body length, for those horns with removable necks, regardless of taper.

4. Frs is the playing frequency of the substitution, the mouthpiece + it&#39;s constriction.  That&#39;s OK by #1, #2, and #3, only it&#39;s impossible to measure without ruining the mouthpiece and we need the neck opening diameter reduction for our constriction. So Benade made his sematic and acoustic compromise, and told us to measure frs with the complete neck.  It is an approximation of the real frs, but it works, provided the neck is of the correct design.

5. I don&#39;t wish to compare saxophones with oboes or bassoons.  There is no need.  First, the model in #2 encompasses every essential aspect of the saxophone, and second, as Benade wrote, not every aspect of the oboe is applicable to the saxophone.











By your comments in this post, I&#39;m beginning to understand more clearly your misinterpretation of Benade&#39;s Frs statements.  Please bear with me.  On page 470 FMA Benade writes:

"We can continue our search for a useful imitation of the missing part of the cone by trying the effect of matching Frs for the reed system to the first-mode natural frequency of the cone apex itself.  In the general frequency neighborhood of Frs the oboe will then "see" an object at its upper end whose acoustical behavior is quite similar to that of the missing apical cone."

"In particular, there will be a pressure node in the neighborhood of the junction of the main bore with the reed staple, lying a little inside the staple at frequencies somewhat above Frs and moving down below the junction at oboe playing frequencies below Frs---behavior that is identical with that found in an ideal cone."

The junction of the main bore (of the oboe) with the reed staple is at the bottom of the staple the reed is attached to---not the top.  Therefore the pressure node of the frequencies just above Frs (the frequency of the reed combined with its staple) will still be just inside the cork end of the staple.  The frequencies just below Frs will go just beyond that down into the body of the oboe itself.  

The counterpart in an alto sax is the frequency produced by the mouthpiece and neck apart from the body of the saxophone  which is very close to Ab concert (written F).  The pressure node of the frequency just above that pitch, F# for example, when played on the complete sax will be found just up inside the neck tenon.  The pressure node of the frequency just below that pitch, an E natural will be slightly past the bottom of the neck receiver into the body of the sax.  

This Ab concert would be the note sounded if the cone to its apex added to the complete neck could produce its resonant frequency.  When the mouthpiece substitutes for the missing cone by matching its volume, the mouthpiece plus the complete neck produces this frequency.  When the Frs - frequency of the reed on its staple or frequency of the sax mouthpiece on its neck is the same as the pitch that would be produced by the missing cone, if it could---the body of the instrument is "fooled" into thinking the cone is complete and behaves accordingly.  This is exactly the effect Benade describes in all of his writings on this topic.  On this point he is very clear.

Benade also uses the term "constricted tube" to describe the staple, bocal, and sax neck as well as the term "constriction" .  There is also a "point of constriction" at the opening of each of these that as you know has a strong effect upon the production of the soundwave inside the mouthpiece.  But when Benade uses the term "cavity plus constriction", he is clearly referring to the mouthpiece and the entire neck.

I hope this helps to clarify these topics in our discussions, in order to move forward instead of just going around in the same circles and getting nowhere.

John

Toby,

I think the easiest and simplest demonstration of vocal tract effects, which does not alter the embouchure in the slightest, is to play in the normal upper register on alto, soprano, or clarinet, and notice the difference in sound and articulated response, between the "ahh" tongue position (back of tongue low), and the ""eee" tongue position (back of tongue high).

            <pre class='message__body'>The mpc substitutes for the missing conic apex. We want it to resemble as closely as possible that missing apex, so that the timing of the wavefronts is preserved as it would be in the real apex. 

The Frs is simply the resonant frequency of the substitution and whatever length of cone is attached to it: that should match the resonant frequency of the complete missing apex to the same diameter of the cone as we are measuring. Frs is not the resonant frequency of the substitution; it is the
 resonant frequency of the substitution/constriction combination, and practically that always includes some length of the body cone. For example, the Frs of a complete tenor sax is C3. This includes the substitution and all of the cone. Because the tube is long and its resonance predominates, this
 is not very helpful in finding out how well we are doing in substituting the truncated part of the cone. The purest measure of that, as Lance points out, would be to have the mpc cut to the point where the neck begins and have the mpc sitting on an infinitely thin plane centered on an opening the
 diameter of the end of the neck. 

As soon as we start adding cone length, we get more and more "normalizing" effect from the cone itself, and therefore a less and less accurate picture of what happens in the higher frequencies, where shorter and shorter wavelengths are more affected by irregularities in the substitution (because
 that length becomes a larger and larger fraction of their total wavelength).

Benade has indeed taken the easy road in specifying a convenient"end" to the constriction, but this adds a fairly large "normalizing" factor, in the shape of the neck cone (or oboe reed staple). On sax, it would be much more accurate to use the new Warburton neck system and just use the attachable
 neck end to measure Frs while it is inserted to the correct point in a mpc. This would add only an extremely short length of cone to the mix. Apparently Benade felt that measuring Frs to the end of the neck was good enough, and indeed other factors such as embouchure and reed characteristics and
 temperature and facings (and vocal tract configuration) probably make that about as accurate as it can be before those other factors have too large an effect and overwhelm finer measurements of the necessary volume.

I hope this helps to clarify these topics in our discussions, in order to move forward instead of just going around in the same circles and getting nowhere.

 The Frs is simply the resonant frequency of the substitution and whatever length of cone is attached to it: that should match the resonant frequency of the complete missing apex to the same diameter of the cone as we are measuring. Frs is not the resonant frequency of the substitution; it is the 
 resonant frequency of the substitution/constriction combination, and practically that always includes some length of the body cone. For example, the Frs of a complete tenor sax is C3. This includes the substitution and all of the cone. Because the tube is long and its resonance predominates, this
  is not very helpful in finding out how well we are doing in substituting the truncated part of the cone. The purest measure of that, as Lance points out, would be to have the mpc cut to the point where the neck begins and have the mpc sitting on an infinitely thin plane centered on an opening
 the  diameter of the end of the neck. 
 
 As soon as we start adding cone length, we get more and more "normalizing" effect from the cone itself, and therefore a less and less accurate picture of what happens in the higher frequencies, where shorter and shorter wavelengths are more affected by irregularities in the substitution (because 
 that length becomes a larger and larger fraction of their total wavelength).
 
 Benade has indeed taken the easy road in specifying a convenient"end" to the constriction, but this adds a fairly large "normalizing" factor, in the shape of the neck cone (or oboe reed staple). On sax, it would be much more accurate to use the new Warburton neck system and just use the
 attachable  neck end to measure Frs while it is inserted to the correct point in a mpc. This would add only an extremely short length of cone to the mix. Apparently Benade felt that measuring Frs to the end of the neck was good enough, and indeed other factors such as embouchure and reed
 characteristics and  temperature and facings (and vocal tract configuration) probably make that about as accurate as it can be before those other factors have too large an effect and overwhelm finer measurements of the necessary volume.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lance,

I&#39;m sorry you just don&#39;t get it.  I&#39;ve done my best to explain.  You
seem to have all the information, but not the understanding.  You
continue to stubbornly cling to the idea that the constriction Benade
refers to is only the point of constriction inside the mouthpiece where
the soundwave enters the opening of the neck instead of the entire
"constricted tube" which is the neck itself.

The rest of your misunderstanding comes from the term Frs.  This is the
Frequency of the reed on its staple when played apart from the oboe. 
The equivalent on the bassoon is the frequency of the reed on its bocal.
The equivalent on the saxophone is the mouthpiece on its neck.  Benade
did not mean that term to refer to the frequency of the mouthpiece alone
with the part of the shaft that goes on the cork cut off and a thin ring
glued to the end to imitate the smaller diameter opening of the neck. 
If that were the case he would have said so.

You have now called Dr. Benade&#39;s writings among other things "vague",
"nebulous", and a "semantic and acoustic compromise".
He in fact is one of the few writers of acoustic texts that are in large
part accessible to a lay person without a scientific background because
he writes, thinks, and explains things so clearly.   It is clearly an
exercise in futility to try to reason with you on this topic since your
mind is fixed on what you imagine to be true.  Unfortunately any further
discussion of topics related to the "missing cone" with such opposite
views of the basic terminology will not be any more productive than this
one.

When the mouthpiece substitutes for the missing cone by matching its
volume, the mouthpiece plus the complete neck produces this
frequency.Â  When the Frs - frequency of the reed on its staple or
frequency of the sax mouthpiece on its neck is the same as the pitch
that would be produced by the missing cone, if it could---the body of
the instrument is "fooled" into thinking the cone is complete and

You use the word "normalizing" like it is a bad thing.   [:)]

Isn&#39;t it more accurate to evaluate the mouthpiece&#39;s substitution of the
missing cone in terms of its interaction with a part of the body of the
instrument?  There is no "real world" parallel to playing the mouthpiece
unattached to a longer tube.  Plus playing on the mouthpiece alone is
far more unstable than playing it on the neck.  On the mouthpiece alone,
the pitch can be just about anywhere you want it to be. Just think how
it would be with 20 mm cut off the end of the shank!  How in the world
would you ever find the resonant frequency of such a small short tube
just by playing it?  I know that I couldn&#39;t do it.  Give me an oboe reed
on a staple, a bassoon reed on a bocal, or a sax mouthpiece on a neck
and I have a chance.

Toby and I are in agreement.  Do you see that?

For your interpretation of Benade to be correct, it must apply to all saxophones.  It does not apply to the straight walled, one piece soprano, so it is incorrect.  The interpretation that Toby and I adhere to applies to ALL saxophones.

As interesting as they are, I&#39;m not interested in comparing oboes to saxophones, in order to understand saxophones.  All I need to do is examine the soprano example I have provided.

Thanks though.  I do understand what you are saying.

Lance,

I&#39;m sorry you just don&#39;t get it.  I&#39;ve done my best to explain.  You seem to have all the information, but not the understanding.  You continue to stubbornly cling to the idea that the constriction Benade refers to is only the point of constriction inside the mouthpiece where the soundwave enters the opening of the neck instead of the entire "constricted tube" which is the neck itself.   

The rest of your misunderstanding comes from the term Frs.  This is the Frequency of the reed on its staple when played apart from the oboe.  The equivalent on the bassoon is the frequency of the reed on its bocal.  The equivalent on the saxophone is the mouthpiece on its neck.  Benade did not mean that term to refer to the frequency of the mouthpiece alone with the part of the shaft that goes on the cork cut off and a thin ring glued to the end to imitate the smaller diameter opening of the neck.  If that were the case he would have said so.

You have now called Dr. Benade&#39;s writings among other things "vague", "nebulous", and a "semantic and acoustic compromise".  
He in fact is one of the few writers of acoustic texts that are in large part accessible to a lay person without a scientific background because he writes, thinks, and explains things so clearly.   It is clearly an exercise in futility to try to reason with you on this topic since your mind is fixed on what you imagine to be true.  Unfortunately any further discussion of topics related to the "missing cone" with such opposite views of the basic terminology will not be any more productive than this one.

In order to clarify Benade&#39;s nebulous statements, I emailed Dr. Joe Wolfe, and asked him to explain, just what constituted the substitution for the missing cone, the mouthpiece volume, or the mouthpiece volume + the neck volume.Â  His reply was, mouthpiece + reed compliance.Â  OK.Â  That is substantiated by #1 and #2.Â  So, without question, the neck is not part of the substitution.Â  The neck is body volume and body length, for those horns with removable necks, regardless of taper.

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

The problem, if problem it is, is that the more of the cone you include, the less any deviation caused by the perturbation at the end of the tube (the mpc) is going to show up. Apparently, things start getting nasty when the truncation is equal to or larger than 1/4 wavelength. Smaller than this
 and the tube compared to truncation is enough so that the wavelength doesn&#39;t "mind" the perturbation too much. The cone looks complete to a long wavelength and so the frequency is not much disturbed. 

However as you go up the scale and the wavelengths become shorter, there starts to be more and more effect from the fact that the mpc is not actually the missing conic apex, but is just a pretender. This is true whether the wavelength is short because the tube is short, or because you are playing
 the a higher mode of a long tube.

I believe that Lance is correct. The limiting case for the Frs, and the one that gives the most accurate picture of how closely the resonance of the mpc matches the resonance of the missing apex, is one in which only the mpc is measured. BUT, you have to set up the correct conditions for how the
 mpc is seen by the cone, and this means that the mpc has to be terminated at the point where it meets the neck in real life, and with the entrance diameter of the neck.

If we had a system like the clarinet, life would be easier, since in that case the end of the mpc is the point where it joins the body and the exit diameter of the mpc is (for all intents and purposes) the entrance diameter of the body. So if we wish to get the Frs of a clainet mpc it can be
 measured by itself.

As Lance points out, doing this for sax is impractical, since it would mean cutting off the mpc at the point where the neck reaches in the shank, and adding a very thin insert to mimic the neck opening diameter.

Actually, it should be possible to mathematically correct for the blown frequency of a mpc--lowering the pitch a given amount for the length and diameter of the extra part of the shank, plus lowering again for the smaller diameter of the neck opening. We could probably find the formulae to do this.

But obviously Benade finds this overkill, and thinks that the extra length of the neck is not enough to throw things off too much for the playing frequencies of the sax.

Remember that we are only trying to correct for frequencies in the upper 2nd octave and plams: the best we can possibly do is to mimic the volume (which makes the mode relationships in most of the first two octaves OK), and add a second correction for this Frs, which pulls the second peak into
 alignment for the top of the second octave and palms. Beyond this we have to count on mode locking to pull errant third, fourth, fifth...n partials into line. 

That&#39;s how I understand it.

You use the word "normalizing" like it is a bad thing.  

Isn&#39;t it more accurate to evaluate the mouthpiece&#39;s substitution of the missing cone in terms of its interaction with a part of the body of the instrument?  There is no "real world" parallel to playing the mouthpiece unattached to a longer tube.  Plus playing on the mouthpiece alone is far more
 unstable than playing it on the neck.  On the mouthpiece alone, the pitch can be just about anywhere you want it to be. Just think how it would be with 20 mm cut off the end of the shank!  How in the world would you ever find the resonant frequency of such a small short tube just by playing it? 
 I know that I couldn&#39;t do it.  Give me an oboe reed on a staple, a bassoon reed on a bocal, or a sax mouthpiece on a neck and I have a chance.

When I did experiments with a soprano sax mouthpiece, I left the baffle alone.  

I drilled from the shank end, bringing the bore almost into the window area.  

I made inserts from 1/2" Delrin rod drilled out to 5/16" diameter.  The inserts were of various lengths.

No insert used represented a large chamber.  The longest insert represented a small chamber.  Etc.

It was easy to find which insert tuned the low octave correctly AND blew the upper octave and into the palm keys in tune.

And it was easy to see the effect too large or too small chamber produced.

But the point is that you can probably find two same brand, same opening mpcs that play the same frequency when they are at the same point on the neck, and whose mode relations are generally the same within a few cents.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, unless you want to change the sound and response of
the piece, it would certainly be better to leave the front
of the baffle alone.

Unfortunately the mpc that I&#39;d like to experiment on is so
thin that there is nothing to really ream out. The easy
way to do the experiments, though--even from its present
state--would be to use modeling clay to reduce the chamber
by given amounts. It should be easy to find how much water
a certain amount of clay displaces, and then simply mold
that into the chamber temporarily.

            <pre class='message__body'>There are some underlying truths that In my opinion trump all of the
esoteric theoretical ideas being put forth by both you and Lance.

They are:

1.  It is impossible to accurately measure the played frequency* of the
used volume of the mouthpiece plus a narrow ring to mimic the opening of
the neck.  (If anyone disagrees with this statement---the burden is upon
them to prove it can be done.  No other argument can have  any merit
whatsoever.)

2.  The mouthpiece always functions as a part of the the truncated
conical tube we call a saxophone.  Therefore, the acoustical behavior of
the sound wave generated by the interior workings of the mouthpiece as
it interacts with the tube that follows it has far more significance
that that of the mouthpiece as a separate unit by itself.

3.  Benade&#39;s use of the cavity + constriction (meaning the entire
staple, bocal, neck) in his missing cone requirements:

a.  Was clearly intended to show the similar acoustical properties
shared by all conical woodwinds.  (You cannot under any circumstances
measure the frequency of an oboe reed  apart from its staple).

b.  Was the most realistic, pragmatic, practical,  and I believe most
accurate under real playing conditions---way to define the frequency
requirement of the missing cone.  By adding the saxophone neck to the
missing cone you are simply moving the point of truncation.  This
changes none of the relationships that are found in the "real world"
playing of the instrument.

*  To refer to the natural frequency of the mouthpiece alone as Frs is a
misnomer.  Benade coined this term to refer to the
Frequency of the oboe reed added to its staple".  He writes on FMA p.
469:

" The reed cavity plus the constricted passageway through the staple (or
the reed plus bocal in the bassoon, or the mouthpiece plus neck in the
saxophone) must therefore be arranged to imitate the acoustical
properties of the missing part of the cone."

He then goes on to describe that the imitation has two (related) parts. 
1. That the volume of the missing cone must be matched by its
substitution.  2.  That the played frequency of the substitution must

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

We may just have to agree to disagre.  Two things though:

1. In all your debate, you have yet to address to any satisfaction, the one-piece, straight sided soprano example. To have any validity, your "rules" must apply to it, or they are no good.

2. "...(the mouthpiece plus neck in
the saxophone) must therefore be arranged to imitate the acoustical
properties of the missing part of the cone."

This is the contradiction which flaws your viewpoint.  This is impossible, as stated, since the neck is not part of the missing cone.  According to your own Missing Cone Volume Study, the missing cone extends from the end of the small neck opening to the apex, and does not include the slightest amount of neck volume or length.  We can just as correctly then, incorporate the bell in this formula.  You can&#39;t have it both ways.  The terminology must be defined and have only one meaning, AND IT MUST APPLY TO ALL SAXOPHONES. 

The view that Toby and I adhere to is the only one that satisfies all requirements.  The only solution to #2 is:  The neck is not part of the missing cone or the substitution, however, the 2 dimensional constriction caused by it&#39;s reduced opening diameter, is, and is the necessary element to complete the mouthpiece + constriction components which constitute the substitution.   It would be easier to see if the saxophone used a clarinet tenon style mouthpiece coupling.  Then the frs could easily be checked correctly using just the mouthpiece and a piece of tape, with a neck opening diameter hole in it, stuck over the end.  The mechanical aspects of the mouthpiece over the neck coupling do not change the acoustical characteristics of the instrument, and Benade&#39;s confusing contradictions are due to his attempt to be mechanically practical, rather than acoustically accurate.

There are some underlying truths that In my opinion trump all of the esoteric theoretical ideas being put forth by both you and Lance.

They are:

1.  It is impossible to accurately measure the played frequency* of the used volume of the mouthpiece plus a narrow ring to mimic the opening of the neck.  (If anyone disagrees with this statement--- the burden is upon them to prove it can be done.  No other argument can have  any merit whatsoever.)

2.  The mouthpiece always functions as a part of the the truncated conical tube we call a saxophone.  Therefore, the acoustical behavior of the sound wave generated by the interior workings of the mouthpiece as it interacts with the tube that follows it has far more significance that that of the mouthpiece as a separate unit by itself.

3.  Benade&#39;s use of the cavity + constriction (meaning the entire staple, bocal, neck) in his missing cone requirements:

a.  Was clearly intended to show the similar acoustical properties shared by all conical woodwinds.  (You cannot under any circumstances measure the frequency of an oboe reed  apart from its staple).

b.  Was the most realistic, pragmatic, practical,  and I believe most accurate under real playing conditions-- -way to define the frequency requirement of the missing cone.  By adding the saxophone neck to the missing cone you are simply moving the point of truncation.  This changes none of the relationships that are found in the "real world" playing of the instrument.

*  To refer to the natural frequency of the mouthpiece alone as Frs is a misnomer.  Benade coined this term to refer to the 
Frequency of the oboe reed added to its staple".  He writes on FMA p. 469:

" The reed cavity plus the constricted passageway through the staple (or the reed plus bocal in the bassoon, or the mouthpiece plus neck in the saxophone) must therefore be arranged to imitate the acoustical properties of the missing part of the cone."

He then goes on to describe that the imitation has two (related) parts.  1. That the volume of the missing cone must be matched by its substitution.  2.  That the played frequency of the substitution must equal the calculated frequency of the actual missing cone added to the constricted passageway using the formula:   F = C/2 Xo

I drilled from the shank end, bringing the bore almost into the window area.  



I made inserts from 1/2" Delrin rod drilled out to 5/16" diameter.  The inserts were of various lengths.



No insert used represented a large chamber.  The longest insert represented a small chamber.  Etc.



It was easy to find which insert tuned the low octave correctly AND blew the upper octave and into the palm keys in tune.



And it was easy to see the effect too large or too small chamber produced.

Yes.  And your earlier description of the effects of volume on intonation was very clear and easy to understand.   It should be automatically reposed, every month. IMO..  

I think adjusting volume in the throat via inserts is the best way to go about adjusting a mouthpiece, just for the sake of volume however.  One may want to adjust sound via volume distribution and shape, in which case, volume adjustments are made in the chamber, and the total volume then corrected in the throat, - rounding out sidewalls up to the tip and enlarging the chamber in order to achieve a more "spread" and flexible sound, for example

There is no need.   First, the model in #2 encompasses every essential

But the point is that you can probably find two same brand, same opening mpcs that play the same frequency when they are at the same point on the neck, and whose mode relations are generally the same within a few cents. That is certainly close enough to have a control for comparison when you alter one.

Just according to this discription:

Placing 3mm insert in the throat would cause the pitch to rise due to the reduction in volume.  Removing it and pushing the neck in 3mm further, to the same point as the end of the insert, would cause the pitch to rise due to the same reduction in volume and even more do to the 3mm reduction in the length of the tube.  Right?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hmmm...

I find it interesting that you go to such lengths to get around the fundamental fact that the point of the whole exercise is to get the Frs of the mpc to match that of the part of the cone that it replaces. The "neck" doesn&#39;t enter into this at all, except to provide the transition to the main body tube, and anyway the length of the neck is arbitrary, comprising a different percentage of the body tube in bass, bari, tenor and alto, and not even existing on many sops, as Lance points out.

And of course it is possible to measure Frs with at least a shorter portion of the cone: just cut off the end of a junker neck and use that instead of the whole neck. It should be pretty obvious, I would think, that the shorter the section of cone used, the more accurate would be the measurement of the mpc Frs.

To (hopefully) settle this debate, I post (yet again) the relevant section from F&R:

"While the saxophone has a single reed like the clarinet, the mouthpiece effectively truncates the conical taper of the main bore and introduces significant changes in tone color. In order that the horn modes be as nearly harmonic as possible, it is desirable that the mouthpiece mimic the acoustic behavior of the missing apex of the cone. This can be done at two frequencies, and then fits reasonably well over the whole range, At low frequencies, the matching is achieved if the internal volume of the mouthpiece is equal to that of the missing conical apex, which requires that the mouthpiece have a slightly bulbous internal shape so that it actually constitutes a sort of Helmholtz resonator. The high frequency match can then be achieved by arranging the shape of the constriction where it joins the main part of the instrument so that the Helmholtz resonance frequency of the mouthpiece is the same as the first resonance of the missing conical apex, at which it is half a wavelength long."

If that isn&#39;t clear I don&#39;t know what is.

Lance--note that these guys stress your point about the mpc introducing "significant changes in tone color". They go on further to say,

"This mouthpiece cavity has an important effect on the spectrum of the saxophone (Benade and Lutgen, 1988)...The cavity acts rather like the mouthcup of a brass instrument...and imparts an extra rise of 6 dB/octave below its resonance frequency and a fall of -6 dB/octave. The mouthpiece resonance frequency is typically comparable with the tonehole cutoff frequency [omega/c], so these extra slopes contribute simply to the behavior above and below [omega/c], which is typically about 850 Hz for an alto saxophone..."

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: The Elusive Missing Cone


    
  There are some underlying truths that In my opinion trump all of the esoteric theoretical ideas being put forth by both you and Lance.

  They are:

  1.  It is impossible to accurately measure the played frequency* of the used volume of the mouthpiece plus a narrow ring to mimic the opening of the neck.  (If anyone disagrees with this statement---the burden is upon them to prove it can be done.  No other argument can have  any merit whatsoever.)

  2.  The mouthpiece always functions as a part of the the truncated conical tube we call a saxophone.  Therefore, the acoustical behavior of the sound wave generated by the interior workings of the mouthpiece as it interacts with the tube that follows it has far more significance that that of the mouthpiece as a separate unit by itself.

  3.  Benade&#39;s use of the cavity + constriction (meaning the entire staple, bocal, neck) in his missing cone requirements:



    a.  Was clearly intended to show the similar acoustical properties shared by all conical woodwinds.  (You cannot under any circumstances measure the frequency of an oboe reed  apart from its staple).

    b.  Was the most realistic, pragmatic, practical,  and I believe most accurate under real playing conditions---way to define the frequency requirement of the missing cone.  By adding the saxophone neck to the missing cone you are simply moving the point of truncation.  This changes none of the relationships that are found in the "real world" playing of the instrument.


  *  To refer to the natural frequency of the mouthpiece alone as Frs is a misnomer.  Benade coined this term to refer to the 
  Frequency of the oboe reed added to its staple".  He writes on FMA p. 469:


    " The reed cavity plus the constricted passageway through the staple (or the reed plus bocal in the bassoon, or the mouthpiece plus neck in the saxophone) must therefore be arranged to imitate the acoustical properties of the missing part of the cone."


  He then goes on to describe that the imitation has two (related) parts.  1. That the volume of the missing cone must be matched by its substitution.  2.  That the played frequency of the substitution must equal the calculated frequency of the actual missing cone added to the constricted passageway using the formula:   F = C/2 Xo

The limiting case for the Frs, and the one that gives the most accurate picture of how closely the resonance of the mpc matches the resonance of the missing apex, is one in which only the mpc is measured.

Hmmm...
 
I find it interesting that you go to such lengths 
to get around the fundamental fact that the point of the whole exercise is to 
get the Frs of the mpc to match that of the part of the cone that it replaces. 
The "neck" doesn&#39;t enter into this at all, except to provide the transition to 
the main body tube, and anyway the length of the neck is arbitrary, comprising a 
different percentage of the body tube in bass, bari, tenor and alto, and not 
even existing on many sops, as Lance points out.
 
And of course it is possible to measure Frs with at 
least a shorter portion of the cone: just cut off the end of a junker neck and 
use that instead of the whole neck. It should be pretty obvious, I would think, 
that the shorter the section of cone used, the more accurate would be the 
measurement of the mpc Frs.
 
To (hopefully) settle this debate, I post (yet 
again) the relevant section from F&R:
 
"While the saxophone has a single reed like the 
clarinet, the mouthpiece effectively truncates the conical taper of the main 
bore and introduces significant changes in tone color. In order that the horn 
modes be as nearly harmonic as possible, it is desirable that the mouthpiece 
mimic the acoustic behavior of the missing apex of the cone. This can be done at 
two frequencies, and then fits reasonably well over the whole range, At low 
frequencies, the matching is achieved if the internal volume of the mouthpiece 
is equal to that of the missing conical apex, which requires that the mouthpiece 
have a slightly bulbous internal shape so that it actually constitutes a sort of 
Helmholtz resonator. The high frequency match can then be achieved by arranging 
the shape of the constriction where it joins the main part of the 
instrument so that the Helmholtz resonance frequency of the 
mouthpiece is the same as the first resonance of the missing conical 
apex, at which it is half a wavelength long."
 
If that isn&#39;t clear I don&#39;t know what 
is.

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: The Elusive 
  Missing Cone
  
  
  
  There are some underlying truths that In my opinion trump all of the 
  esoteric theoretical ideas being put forth by both you and Lance.

They 
  are:

1.  It is impossible to accurately measure the played 
  frequency* of the used volume of the mouthpiece plus a narrow ring to mimic 
  the opening of the neck.  (If anyone disagrees with this 
  statement--- the burden is upon them to prove it can be done.  No 
  other argument can have  any merit whatsoever.)

2.  The 
  mouthpiece always functions as a part of the the truncated conical tube we 
  call a saxophone.  Therefore, the acoustical behavior of the sound wave 
  generated by the interior workings of the mouthpiece as it interacts with the 
  tube that follows it has far more significance that that of the mouthpiece as 
  a separate unit by itself.

3.  Benade&#39;s use of the cavity + 
  constriction (meaning the entire staple, bocal, neck) in his missing cone 
  requirements:


  a.  Was clearly intended to show the similar acoustical 
    properties shared by all conical woodwinds.  (You cannot under any 
    circumstances measure the frequency of an oboe reed  apart from its 
    staple).

b.  Was the most realistic, pragmatic, practical,  
    and I believe most accurate under real playing conditions-- -way to 
    define the frequency requirement of the missing cone.  By adding the 
    saxophone neck to the missing cone you are simply moving the point of 
    truncation.  This changes none of the relationships that are found in 
    the "real world" playing of the instrument.

*  To 
  refer to the natural frequency of the mouthpiece alone as Frs is a 
  misnomer.  Benade coined this term to refer to the 
Frequency 
  of the oboe reed added to its staple".  He writes on FMA p. 
  469:


  " The reed cavity plus the constricted passageway through the 
    staple (or the reed plus bocal in the bassoon, or the mouthpiece plus neck 
    in the saxophone) must therefore be arranged to imitate the acoustical 
    properties of the missing part of the cone."

He then 
  goes on to describe that the imitation has two (related) parts.  1. That 
  the volume of the missing cone must be matched by its substitution.  
  2.  That the played frequency of the substitution must equal the 
  calculated frequency of the actual missing cone added to the constricted 
  passageway using the formula:   F = C/2 Xo

  Remember that we are only trying to correct for frequencies in the upper 2nd

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, this is a very interesting question, because it would
seem to suggest that to get intermode tuning correct when
the upper register is sharp, we should actually reduce the
chamber volume and pull the mpc further off the cork, but
this was not my experience empirically, unless I am
totally fooling myself.

For example, I did some (unfortunately not-too-rigorous)
tests with this Beechler alto piece and a Vandoren A35.
The Beechler to play G4 in tune, has a total length from
neck end to reed tip of ~66 mm. The Vandoren slots in at
~61 mm. And yet the Beechler plays much sharper in the
second register than the Vandoren, by about 15 cents. Huh?

The tip openings are about the same, but they blow much
differently, and so this may have something to do with
embouchure pressure. I can&#39;t really keep all the variables
straight.

But consider this: If the second mode is sharp, we can
keep pulling the mpc off the cork until the volume is
correct and the modes are in line (as larger volume
narrows the mode relationships). However at this point the
whole shebang is flat. So now we ream out the chamber so
that it goes flat at the same position. This will narrow
the modes again, making the second mode even flatter than
the first. Now we push the mpc on the cork. The first mode
rises, the second mode rises even faster (as reducing
volume widens the modes). When the two modes are again in
alignment at concert tuning you win the game.

            <pre class='message__body'>It is worth joining.  I have been a member for over 3 years.  Many of
the papers are just abstracts, but there are some full studies that
can&#39;t be found anywhere else.

In light of all of the esoteric theorizing about finding the frequency
(NOT Frs) of the missing cone that the mouthpiece is a substitution for,
I have done a visual representation of what I believe to be true.  That
is:

In theory both a cut off mouthpiece with a constricted ring at its end
and a mouthpiece at its normal position on a neck apart from a saxophone
can be used to accurately estimate the frequency of the missing cone. 
However, only one of these methods is practical and relatively easy and
effective to use.

The visual and mathematical support of this idea can be found here:

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree that finding the Frequency (NOT Frs) of the missing cone is the
point of the exercise.  However I believe (as does Benade) that
comparing the CALCULATED  Frequency of the length of the neck added to
the length of the missing cone with the PLAYED frequency of the
mouthpiece and neck apart from the saxophone gives an effective and
accurate way to do so.  It certainly is easier than chopping off the
mouthpiece and adding a narrow ring at the end to mimic the constriction
of the neck opening.

  Do you believe you could actually play that short mouthpiece device and
with any certainty zero in on it&#39;s natural (Helmholtz) resonant
frequency.  I know I certainly could not.  It is hard enough for me to
consistently produce an A concert on the alto sax mouthpiece alone---let
alone find the pitch that the mouthpiece "naturally" wants to play at. 
Remember too that most mouthpieces go 20 to 30 mm on to the cork and so
that much of the mouthpiece would need to be chopped off the shank.

It is interesting that Fletcher is saying essentially the same thing as
Benade.  However one part is not very clear to me to which I wish he
would have provided more detail.  It is the sentence that follows your
quotation in his book.  It reads:

"The high frequency match can then be achieved by arranging the shape of
the constriction where it joins the main part of the instrument so that
the Helmholtz resonance frequency of the mouthpiece is the same as the
first resonance of the missing conical apex, at which it is a half
wavelength long." [emphasis added]

It is almost like a riddle to solve.  How does one "arrange the shape of
the constriction" where it joins the main part of the instrument?  Is
the main part of the instrument the neck, or is it the body?  He seems
to be saying that the length of the missing cone  determines its
frequency "at which it is a half wavelength long".

This link gives a visual representation of what I believe to be true in
regard to finding the frequency of the elusive "missing cone".

This can be done at two frequencies, and then fits reasonably well over
the whole range, At low frequencies, the matching is achieved if the
internal volume of the mouthpiece is equal to that of the missing
conical apex, which requires that the mouthpiece have a slightly bulbous
internal shape so that it actually constitutes a sort of Helmholtz
resonator.

There is no need. First, the model in #2 encompasses every essential

of the oboe is applicable to the saxophone.

When the mouthpiece substitutes for the missing cone by matching its

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree that it is not practical to measure the mpc alone,
although it would be relatively easy to make a small brass
pipe with the same entrance diameter and angle as the
neck. It would need only to stick out from the shank far
enough to be able to easily remove it.

Frs stands for "resonance frequency". Both the missing
cone and the mpc have one and they should be the same. How
does your use of "frequency" differ?

I&#39;ll have a look at your link now.

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

I&#39;m certainly happy to keep discussing the theory, but I have to tell you that I wonder just how valuable it is in real life. I just completed some informal tests of extremely different mpcs, including an old Conn CMel mpc with a shank that fits an alto and has a huge chamber like a bubble, a Lakey, a Vandoren classic and that snaky Beechler. To make life even more interesting, I molded a huge blob of clay into the Beechler, which took up about half the chamber volume and some of the lower baffle too. This changed the tuning point on the neck until the mpc was just hanging off the end.

The result is that I realized that it made barely any difference. The huge blob of clay did seem, paradoxically, to make the second register somewhat sharp, but for the most part there was very little real-world difference , and nothing that I couldn&#39;t easily compensate for without a second thought with my embouchure. The CMel mpc had to be put on so far that the end of the shank was past the cork, but once there it played quite happily in tune, just as the Beechler did a good 10 mm farther back. If there was more than five cents difference between the way they played the first and second registers I couldn&#39;t tell.

My point here is that once you are anywhere in the ballpark, so many other factors become more important that small adjustments such as Frs are just subsumed in the general chaos of embouchure changes, reed effects, tube perturbations, temperature gradients and a whole number of other parameters which influence the final sound. In any case, as you pointed out, it is not so easy to change the Frs of the mpc, since it depends almost entirely on the volume and the exit diameter. Once the volume is correct Frs should follow along. I may do some experiments to change the neck diameter at the end with clay, just to see what happens, but in normal life you would not do such a thing.

Trying to find the Frs of the mpc was a nightmare. I did get a nice steady tone when blowing across it like a bottle with the window sealed, which is what a Helmholtz resonance is all about, but that was much higher than when the mpc was blown, unless I tightened my embouchure to the max. This makes sense, since the reed itself lowers all the resonant frequencies of the horn, and of course there is the question of virtual volume under the reed--not to mention that reed effects really predominate here due to the very weak impedance of the little mpc chamber compared to the influence of that big old reed controlled by the player.

This alone makes me see why Benade would recommend measuring the Frs in combination with the neck, but in that case, the Frs is strongly dependent on the enclosed volume of the neck, and small changes in the mpc volume hardly make a difference. Every single mpc, once it was set to play in tune, had just about the same Frs, no matter what the internal configuration. If there is a difference between the register tuning depending on length I couldn&#39;t sort it out among all the other effects.

I can easily lip the second register 30-40 cents either way, keeping decent tone. I  don&#39;t think that is in any way exceptional. Given that, what difference do a few cents make depending on the mpc configuration? Can you even tell?

When and if I have more time I am going to try to do this with a little bit more systematic methodology, and perhaps I will see some trends, but I can already see that the effects that we are endlessly discussing are slight at best.

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: The Elusive Missing Cone


    
  I agree that finding the Frequency (NOT Frs) of the missing cone is the point of the exercise.  However I believe (as does Benade) that comparing the CALCULATED  Frequency of the length of the neck added to the length of the missing cone with the PLAYED frequency of the mouthpiece and neck apart from the saxophone gives an effective and accurate way to do so.  It certainly is easier than chopping off the mouthpiece and adding a narrow ring at the end to mimic the constriction of the neck opening.  

   Do you believe you could actually play that short mouthpiece device and with any certainty zero in on it&#39;s natural (Helmholtz) resonant frequency.  I know I certainly could not.  It is hard enough for me to consistently produce an A concert on the alto sax mouthpiece alone---let alone find the pitch that the mouthpiece "naturally" wants to play at.  Remember too that most mouthpieces go 20 to 30 mm on to the cork and so that much of the mouthpiece would need to be chopped off the shank.

  It is interesting that Fletcher is saying essentially the same thing as Benade.  However one part is not very clear to me to which I wish he would have provided more detail.  It is the sentence that follows your quotation in his book.  It reads:

  "The high frequency match can then be achieved by arranging the shape of the constriction where it joins the main part of the instrument so that the Helmholtz resonance frequency of the mouthpiece is the same as the first resonance of the missing conical apex, at which it is a half wavelength long." [emphasis added]

  It is almost like a riddle to solve.  How does one "arrange the shape of the constriction" where it joins the main part of the instrument?  Is the main part of the instrument the neck, or is it the body?  He seems to be saying that the length of the missing cone  determines its frequency "at which it is a half wavelength long".

  This link gives a visual representation of what I believe to be true in regard to finding the frequency of the elusive "missing cone".    Calculating the Missing Cone Frequency

In order that the horn modes be as nearly harmonic as possible, it is desirable that the mouthpiece mimic the acoustic behavior of the missing apex of the cone. This can be done at two frequencies, and then fits reasonably well over the whole range, At low frequencies, the matching is achieved if the internal volume of the mouthpiece is equal to that of the missing conical apex, which requires that the mouthpiece have a slightly bulbous internal shape so that it actually constitutes a sort of Helmholtz resonator.

The inserts were inserted in the shank end, and pushed all the way up to the window.  With the shank removed, the mouthpiece had to be pushed further onto the neck cork in order to tune the lower octave.  But then the mouthpiece was sharp on the upper end of the upper octave, high C and on up into the palm keys.

With the longer inserts, the mouthpiece had to be pulled out somewhat to tune the low register (getting that missing cone volume correct, which caused the top end to go flat.

With one of the shorter inserts the result was good tuning in both registers and the palm keys were in tune.  But I had known this from other mouthpiece experiments.

Like Goldilocks, I had to find the one that was not too hot, not too cold, but was just right.

            <pre class='message__body'>Please Toby.  Both you and Lance have misunderstood Benade&#39;s term from
the beginning.  Frs  is first used by Benade on p. 467.

An oboe reed mounted on its little brass tube (called a staple) may be
thought of as a tiny woodwind in its own right, with a playing frequency
that is extremely sensitive to the forces exerted on the reed by the
player&#39;s embouchure and by his blowing pressure. . . If a player first
uses the reed to sound a specified note on his instrument and then plays
with the same embouchure and blowing pressure on the reed alone, the
resulting frequency Frs of the reed-plus-staple turns out to be well
defined upon test and retest.  [emphasis added]

Frs is the abbreviation of  Frequency of the reed on its staple.  The
equivalent on bassoon is the reed on its bocal.  The equivalent on the
saxophone is the mouthpiece on its neck.  Obviously as Lance points out,
a one piece straight soprano sax cannot have a measurable Frs because it
does not have a detachable neck (staple).   That does not mean that the
measurement of the Frs on saxes with removable necks to determine if the
frequency of the mouthpiece substitute for the missing cone matches its
calculated frequency is invalid.   That is a flawed argument.

Here is the logic that I use:    Xo  -  the calculated missing cone
length   Y - the measured neck length

If the calculated frequency of  Xo + Y  =  the played frequency  of   Xo
+ Y

Dropping the constant Y from each side of the equation we get

calculated frequency  Xo  =  played frequency Xo  which means that

The pitch requirement of the mouthpiece substitution has been met!

            <pre class='message__body'>I think this is a truth.  Some of the literature has placed too much importance on conditions "that must be met".  We can not even agree on what the authors meant but this does not appear to be that important either.  Some of the modern researchers are working more on understanding the embouchure better since that appears to be a more important factor than the finer details of the equipment design.  So far, the best results can be obtained via personal experimentation with set-ups and practice.   Resistance may be futile...

  I think this is a truth.  Some of the literature has placed too much importance on conditions "that must be met".  We can not even agree on what the authors meant but this does not appear to be that important either.  Some of the modern researchers are working more on understanding the embouchure better since that appears to be a more important factor than the finer details of the equipment design.

            <pre class='message__body'>Of course I do, Morgan. Insofar as I know, pretty much everybody I know who
is actually successful in the business of making mouthpieces for a living
understands it. That being said, it would appear from the discussion that
the minutia being argued over has little practical application. It&#39;s the old
"how many angels can dance on the head of a pin" scenario.  I note with
interest that the members of this group (including myself) who are actually
in the business of making mouthpieces (and there are a few here) refrain
from participating.

 

I have no objection whatsoever to the discussion, and hope it continues. I
would like to see the participants move into a more practical application
with real world examples that can be independently verified. I am not
absolutely certain, based on my experience, that some of what I have been
reading here recently is entirely correct.

Welcome back Steve.  Since you are the resident "expert" on this forum who designs and builds mouthpieces.  I&#39;m hoping you can share some of the knowledge you have gained from that experience with the rest of us.  For example:

If you have two tenor mouthpieces with exactly the same interior volume, but one is longer and narrower than the other:

1.  Will they both play in tune at the same position on the neck?

2.  Will the longer mouthpiece play the second mode and/or short tube notes differently (sharp or flat) compared to the other shorter mouthpiece of identical volume?

If a customer wrote to you that their current mouthpiece sounds great on their Conn 10M but everything from high C# on up is very sharp, what different mouthpiece characteristics would you recommend to solve their problem?  If you would recommend one of your mouthpieces instead, what are the characteristics of your mouthpiece design that solves this problem.  

These are just questions off the top of my head. I&#39;m sure others on the forum can think of even more questions that can tap into your knowledge and experience.

Thanks.

forum can think of even more questions that can tap into your knowledge and
experience.

Thanks.

I just hope your refusal to respond to my questions about mouthpiece volume here doesn&#39;t give the appearance to others that you don&#39;t know the answers.  Maybe if someone else were to ask you those same questions you could respond without having to "participate in any discussion" with me.  Just a thought.

John,

I understand exactly what Benade is saying, in every case of the use of frs.  As I explained, and you have yet to address the issue, in 

https://ccrma.stanford.edu/marl/Benade/documents/Benade-Physics323-1977.pdf

, page 21, just 1" above Benade&#39;s discription of frs being, "Frs - played frequency of the reed on it&#39;s own cavity and neck.", is his illustration of the parts of a conical reed instrument.  Clearly marked are, Xo, on the left, (the length of the substitution for the missing cone) and L, on the right (the length of the body&#39;s main bore).  On the side of Xo, are clearly shown the two parts of the missing cone, the cavity and the constriction.  If we take Benade literally, as you do, the neck ("Constriction - ...it is the sax neck.") is part of the missing cone, in it&#39;s entirety, in both volume and length.

As clear as that is established in both diagram and description, you still claim in your Missing Cone Volume Study, that the neck is not part of the missing cone. I, personally, can not ignore this huge contradiction.  Your use of your own original terminology, "The true missing cone is the part beyond the end of the saxophone neck", doesn&#39;t cut it for me.   I won&#39;t buy an interpretation of Benade, which means one thing here, and the opposite thing there,

I beginning to believe 3 things.

a.  that you have to be right---no matter what.
b.  that you love to argue.
c.  that  a and b together make up the frequency of "your" missing cone

The "true missing cone" is the truncated section at the end of the
saxophone neck that allows a mouthpiece to be put on the end to act as
its substitution.

The neck is considered a part of a missing conical section only if and
when it and the mouthpiece are detached from the body of the saxophone
to test the Frs.  The neck is never really missing unless you lose it
and can&#39;t play your saxophone.  Let&#39;s have the last word on this because
the argument is going beyond silly to the ridiculous.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,

It doesn&#39;t matter a bit. The frequency of the mpc volume
plus whatever part of the cone is included must match the
frequency of that length of complete cone. End of story,
end of chapter. If you use the full length of the sax,
playing low Bb, that should be the same frequency as the
resonant frequency of the entire sax if the cone were
complete. If you use one centimeter of neck, the Frs
should be the same frequency as the missing cone plus that
one centimeter of neck. Why is this so much trouble to
understand?

Benade&#39;s writings are not the Bible. He takes certain
license and uses descriptive approximations. If you want
to understand it fully you have to go strictly with the
math.

That being said, just why are we discussing this? What
practical use is this? I have to agree with Steve that you
need to actually do some empirical tests. It was certainly
instructive to me to see just how little all this matters,
or rather, just how little all this matters in light of
all the other factors (such as the Fr--reed resonance)
that also play a part in determining intonation.

This is like determinism--you are not going to be able to
predict every event in the universe from fully
understanding physical laws (as if that were possible). If
you use a rough understanding of the principles involved
as a guide it should help you move in the right empirical
directions, but this is all good only to a first
approximation in the real world.

When I once asked Joe Wolfe some questions like these, in
one of my debates with Lance, he sent me a cartoon about
"nerd sniping". I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t send it along, because
you should see it. In it two guys are discussing "nerd
sniping"--you give a nerd an interesting-looking but
totally irrelevant problem--the illustration was of trying
to figure out the impedance across a large series of one
ohm resistors. The nerd gets the problem and gets so
mentally lost, standing in the road and trying to work out
the answer, that he gets creamed by truck that he doesn&#39;t
notice barreling down the road. The two guys then figure
out how to score the hit.

The meaning was pretty obvious to me: get out of your head
and get to work on what matters. It is very easy to
experiment with different chamber volumes and sizes. Try
it, like I did, and find out just how much difference it
does or doesn&#39;t make, and what differences you find. 

Since embouchure changes can so thoroughly mask mpc
changes, it would probably be a good idea to get your "hot
lips" machine going. Even then, you need to consider the
fact that an artificial embouchure is static, and cannot
really represent what happens when you have a real player
dynamically controlling reed resonance.

      Ok Lance.  I will accept your idea as having validity in the real world when you can demonstrate the played frequency of a mouthpiece the same length as the portion of the mouthpiece that extends beyond the end of the neck is the same as the calculated frequency of the apical missing cone.  Good luck.

Lance,

I beginning to believe 3 things.

a.  that you have to be right---no matter what.
b.  that you love to argue.
c.  that  a and b together make up the frequency of "your" missing cone

The "true missing cone" is the truncated section at the end of the saxophone neck that allows a mouthpiece to be put on the end to act as its substitution.

The neck is considered a part of a missing conical section only if and when it and the mouthpiece are detached from the body of the saxophone to test the Frs.  The neck is never really missing unless you lose it and can&#39;t play your saxophone.  Let&#39;s have the last word on this because the argument is going beyond silly to the ridiculous.

I, personally, can not ignore this huge contradiction.  Your use of your own original terminology, "The true missing cone is the part beyond the end of the saxophone neck", doesn&#39;t cut it for me.   I won&#39;t buy an interpretation of Benade, which means one thing here, and the opposite thing there,

This discussion has deteriorated to arguments over details that are nearly meaningless... where I would say, "so what?"  Even if we were able to calculate an exact number for X, what are we going to do with it?  We certainly aren&#39;t going to reshape the bore of a customer&#39;s saxophone, nor are we going to relocate the toneholes.  

In the end, all we can do here is work on his mouthpiece.  Even here, I have found that not every intonation and response issue can be corrected with a proper mouthpiece, or altering a mouthpiece.  Sometimes it&#39;s just the lousy instrument.  And sometimes it&#39;s just the player.

I also question the point of all this use of bandwidth and fail to see any
practical application. The realities of the actual use of saxophone in the
real world have been all but totally ignored.

 

As to your suggestion that an artificial embouchure might yield some useful
findings, I very strongly disagree. If the ultimate goal of any research is
to "improve the breed", then you must conduct any and all tests in "real
world" situations, using bona fide players. There is considerable variation
among highly skilled players in embouchure, and for any product or design
improvement to be viable, it MUST work for all of them, not in an artificial
environment. This is the only way any design improvement is of any use
whatsoever to the saxophone community, and this is why artificial tests such
as you propose have been consistently rejected by designers and
manufacturers. The results have no relevance in the real world, and if they
have no relevance to the real world, what&#39;s the point?

 

Instead of the constant regurgitation of writings of the past, I would
suggest that the participants who insist on pursuing these matters actually
build some products and have them properly evaluated by independent third
parties. I would admonish them to "do it, THEN talk about it"!

 

It is really quite easy to enter the saxophone/mouthpiece business. Anyone
with original designs or improvements that they wish to advance can easily
do it. Sharon and I entered the business independently of any other
corporate entanglements a little over two years ago, and here is our
process, which can easily be used by anyone else who wishes to advance the
craft:

 

We build the first product prototype at our shop in New Orleans, and then
have it evaluated by our "posse" of full time professional players with a
strong studio work background. We listen to what the posse has to say and
make changes as necessary. If the product in question is a mouthpiece or
small component, we usually convert the design to a Solid Works file. If it
is an entire instrument, we prepare extensive drawings and specifications.
We then contact appropriate manufacturers (all of our products except
lubricants are manufactured by outside vendors who build to our
specifications) and upon selection of an appropriate vendor, have them build
a few (less than five) prototypes and send them to us. It is most important
that the vendor build multiple examples so we can be certain they can repeat
the manufacturing process consistently. We then verify that the prototypes
are built to our specification, and call the posse in again and have them
extensively play tested. If the prototypes are deemed acceptable, we then
order a production run.

 

It is in no way difficult to find factories to build your products. The
world is full of them. Our mouthpiece blanks (all are finished at our New
Orleans office) are manufactured by five different factories located in the
USA, Taiwan, and China. We make 18 different mouthpiece models, and try to
choose factories based on their expertise in a particular type of
manufacture. While it is true that the mouthpieces sold under my name
several years ago by Orpheus Music were modifications of existing designs
(sourced from two different vendors, one in Taiwan and one in China),
everything we sell today is unique to us and available nowhere else.

 

This is not a complicated process. Anyone can do it. All you have to do is
come up with an improved design, go to the NAMM show or Musik Messe to find
a wide variety of factories, and build your product. The market will then
tell you if you are correct in your design or not!

Hi John,

It doesn&#39;t matter a bit. The frequency of the mpc volume
plus whatever part of the cone is included must match the
frequency of that length of complete cone. End of story,
end of chapter. If you use the full length of the sax,
playing low Bb, that should be the same frequency as the
resonant frequency of the entire sax if the cone were
complete. If you use one centimeter of neck, the Frs
should be the same frequency as the missing cone plus that
one centimeter of neck. Why is this so much trouble to
understand?

Benade&#39;s writings are not the Bible. He takes certain
license and uses descriptive approximations. If you want
to understand it fully you have to go strictly with the
math.

That being said, just why are we discussing this? What
practical use is this? I have to agree with Steve that you
need to actually do some empirical tests. It was certainly
instructive to me to see just how little all this matters,
or rather, just how little all this matters in light of
all the other factors (such as the Fr--reed resonance)
that also play a part in determining intonation.

This is like determinism--you are not going to be able to
predict every event in the universe from fully
understanding physical laws (as if that were possible). If
you use a rough understanding of the principles involved
as a guide it should help you move in the right empirical
directions, but this is all good only to a first
approximation in the real world.

When I once asked Joe Wolfe some questions like these, in
one of my debates with Lance, he sent me a cartoon about
"nerd sniping". I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t send it along, because
you should see it. In it two guys are discussing "nerd
sniping"--you give a nerd an interesting-looking but
totally irrelevant problem--the illustration was of trying
to figure out the impedance across a large series of one
ohm resistors. The nerd gets the problem and gets so
mentally lost, standing in the road and trying to work out
the answer, that he gets creamed by truck that he doesn&#39;t
notice barreling down the road. The two guys then figure
out how to score the hit.

The meaning was pretty obvious to me: get out of your head
and get to work on what matters. It is very easy to
experiment with different chamber volumes and sizes. Try
it, like I did, and find out just how much difference it
does or doesn&#39;t make, and what differences you find. 

Since embouchure changes can so thoroughly mask mpc
changes, it would probably be a good idea to get your "hot
lips" machine going. Even then, you need to consider the
fact that an artificial embouchure is static, and cannot
really represent what happens when you have a real player
dynamically controlling reed resonance.

I can only speak for myself.  In planning some original, machined from brass rod, mouthpiece prototypes, I decided to go back to the purely theoretical basics, which I then compare and combine with what I know from my playing experience, so the discussion of equivalent mouthpiece volume and how to determine it, mouthpiece chamber volume, missing cone volume and how to determine it, and input from those also interested, even conflictingly, are of use.  I think that will yield more results than just randomly altering some pre-existing product to see if it improves.  So, for me, the gain is worth the pain, but I can see how others might feel otherwise.  They do have the option of just not opening the message after all. I use that option myself frequently.  It&#39;s easier than complaining.
