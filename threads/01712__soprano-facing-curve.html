            <pre class='message__body'>Hi There,
Would someone please be so kind as to give me measurements so that I 
can rescue a Selmer Soprano S80 D mpc which I have almost bodged by 
going too heavy on the table, making the tip opening too thin. I 
guess that I can say that I learn more from my mistakes, and the 
bigger the mistake the more that I learn!!!
The biggest lesson to learn I think is patience and not to rush jobs.

I think I want something like a 18mm Facing (0.0015) and a tip 
opening of about 1.5mm
I will be using the feelers .0015 .010 .024 .034 .050 as listed in 
the Eric Brand Manual.

Many thanks
I can&#39;t begin to thank you so much for the value of this Group, I am 
so pleased that I have discovered it!.
Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>dolgishev&#39;s numbers look good if you measure the 1.50 mm tip at the very
tip of the mouthpiece.  If you measure the tip inside the tip rail, and the
rail is .75mm thick, then the curve given is for a 1.40 mm tip opening.

Peter, Is this OK or would you like numbers for 1.50 mm as measured inside
the tip rail?

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,
Thankyou, I would also appreciate the measurements for a tip opening of 1.5  
measured inside the tip rail.
Best Regards,

The above is for a 1.5 mm tip as mesured on the very tip of the MP.

For 1.5 mm as measured from the inside of a .75 mm wide tip rail:
18.0
12.8
8.2
5.7
2.4

For the inside of a .5 mm wide tip rail (fairly thin):
18.0
12.7
8.0
5.5
2.2
