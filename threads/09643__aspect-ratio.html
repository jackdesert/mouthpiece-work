            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s a ratio, so whether metric or imperial, the number will be identical.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Y'all are talking about different things. The ellipse's aspect ratio is the
ratio of the long axis to the short axis. The larger that number, the less
circular the ellipse is. Keith was talking about elliptical ratios of between
7:1 and 12:1 - the long axis is between 7 and 12 times as long as the short
axis.

Hi , I can&#39;t find the clinic section. 7/12 ratio? It seems clarinets are 
generally 17/1 and alto sax approx. 10/1 What would a 7/12 measure out to in 
real terms? Are we mixing metric and imperial measure here?
