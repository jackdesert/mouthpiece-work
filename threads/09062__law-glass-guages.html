            <pre class='message__body'>I just wanted to put in an unsolicited plug for Lawrie Waldron&#39;s glass gauges.  Got a couple from him this week (Keith has some for sale IIRC), and I have to say this is the best glass gauge ever.  It&#39;s accurate, laser etched, the lines are nice and thin and the angled lines make alignment much easier than the parallel lines on all the other gauges.  You can&#39;t do great work with crap tools, and this is a very good tool indeed.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ll ask him for an email address unless you want to phone the UK.   Keith has some of the gauges for sale, though.
