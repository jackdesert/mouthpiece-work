            <pre class='message__body'>Good day,

    In my limited refacing time, I&#39;ve been using the radius of an arc using the tip opening as the height and the facing length (x2) as the length.

How can I apply the tip opening and the facing length to find the radius of an actual circle? 

Thank you for your consideration and Mr. Bradbury, thank you for approving my request!!
  
All the best.

            <pre class='message__body'>There are some spreadsheets in the Files section that should help with this.

I’m pretty “mathematically challenged”…..you’re the expert…..is it possible to get you to publish “basic mouthpiece math for dummies”? I’m sure a lot of members of this group would appreciate it!

            <pre class='message__body'>Look in the Files Methods area.   There is a Refacing for Dummies file there.
