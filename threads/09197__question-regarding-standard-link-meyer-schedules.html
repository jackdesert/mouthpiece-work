            <pre class='message__body'>The spreadsheets I have posted are not based on extensive measurements of mouthpieces.  Early on, I decided this would be difficult to do well.  A lot of what you would measure would contain defects from the maker or abuse/wear.  So I came up with a family of curves based on a few curves I found to work well.  The tip openings are based on the various charts that have been around.  However, I am starting to realize that more makers apparently specify their tip openings at the very tip than I previously thought.  My charts are all based on tip openings measured from inside the tip rail.

Ralph Morgan&#39;s Sax Journal article on Meyers has some detailed tip openings and facing lengths for Meyers.  However when I compare actual new or vintage Meyers to the chart, some come close but almost none are spot on.  Plus, the degree of ellipse varies.  But it only takes a shift in a couple of feeler readings to move the ellipse of best fit a full number or two.

I think Theo tried to fit his "Ring" curves to an extensive data base of vintage Link measurements.  From the plots on his site you can see some "noise" in his data set.  Theo has said that he deviates from these curves fits to get the results he wants from a facing curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Keith,

Thanks for the information regarding the Link/Meyer curves. Really interesting stuff, I see what you&#39;re saying about how it&#39;d be difficult to find some consistent readings from such old pieces. I&#39;ll definitely keep all that in mind.
