            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I found this webpage http://www.saxwelt.de/index.php?
module=ContentExpress&func=display&btitle=CE&mid=&ceid=463 and it 
looks like an interesting 2-piece sax mouthpiece design called "The 
Steamer".

Unfortunately the website is in German and my translating is not 
very good.  I cannot understand what the design is trying to 
achieve, but the page does mention Link and Brilhart mouthpieces and 
they seem to have quite a few models available.

The shank/bore seems to be metal and the body looks like hard rubber 
or plastic, although I don&#39;t know how it would be manufactured or 
how it fits on the shank.

Does anyone have any information on this model of mouthpiece or 
maybe you could provide a bit of translation ?

Thanks in advance

Rhys

  Hi,

  I found this webpage http://www.saxwelt.de/index.php?
  module=ContentExpress&func=display&btitle=CE&mid=&ceid=463 and it 
  looks like an interesting 2-piece sax mouthpiece design called "The 
  Steamer".

  Unfortunately the website is in German and my translating is not 
  very good. I cannot understand what the design is trying to 
  achieve, but the page does mention Link and Brilhart mouthpieces and 
  they seem to have quite a few models available.

  The shank/bore seems to be metal and the body looks like hard rubber 
  or plastic, although I don&#39;t know how it would be manufactured or 
  how it fits on the shank.

  Does anyone have any information on this model of mouthpiece or 
  maybe you could provide a bit of translation ?

  Thanks in advance

I worked on a couple of them and they appear to me as Asian made.

  There are some metal clarinet mouthpieces on eBay that 2-piece the other
  way. The interior is entirely metal. But the tenon and half the body is
  plastic. The beak is metal with an oval bite plate like a metal Selmer. 
  I worked on a couple of them and they appear to me as Asian made.

They may mean an "A" chamber shape, like many Brilharts.
