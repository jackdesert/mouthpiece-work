            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

No problem on the posting.  I did read more into it than you meant.  About
where to measure on the tip opening, first let me say that I used the same
vernier method that Ron used before I go smart.  Secondly,  I used to
measure on the outside of the tiprail until a customer went off on me and
told me that the reed doesn&#39;t even touch the outside part of the tiprail.  I
think he was right.

Now, I use the depth tool which Keith is right, it is very much like the
Winslow device which I like even more.  Paul was kind enough to hip me to
it.

Ya know, I always wanted other mouthpiece techs to talk to but when I
approached them, the were very standoffish.  This is going to be great for
everyone here. I&#39;ll be in Chicago from the 16th - 24th but will return
emails after that. Have a great day. Phil
