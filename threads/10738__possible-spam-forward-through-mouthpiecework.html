            <pre class='message__body'>I received an email from the mouthpiecework group this week as a forward from Bill Hausman with a link to something called canews15.net When this hit my system, it has apparently been trying to send spam to many of the contacts on my email list since I have been getting failure to deliver messages on my email due to these  contacts being no longer valid since I had not cleaned out of my contacts list, which I have now done. I contacted two folks on my current list by phone and they both informed me that they had received spam under my email name. I would like to know if anybody on the group&#39;s email list has received anything like this. And any practical advice on dealing with such spamming incidents. If I have played any part in unwittingly sending spam to the valued members of Mouthpiecework, I do apologize in advance.</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>Several of us have been victims of this Email spam/virus.  I have not seen a lot of info about it and it&#39;s variations.  I think it helps more to change your Email password than it does to scan and clean your PC.

            <pre class='message__body'>No problem Bill, I certainly don&#39;t hold you responsible in any way. This is one of the more egregious elements of email and the Internet.
