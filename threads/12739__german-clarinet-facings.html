            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
 

 Just wondering if anyone knows the difference between German and French clarinet mouthpiece facings?
 (not the internal dimensions or blanks, I literally mean just the facing)

 

 I understand that typically German facings are long and really closed but so are some
 French facings too (for example, Vandoren M13, Brad Behn mouthpieces, Gigliotti mouthpieces, etc...)
 So does that mean that the shape of the German facing curve is different to the French? 
 On this website: https://vsl.co.at/en/Clarinet_in_Bb/Two_Forms https://vsl.co.at/en/Clarinet_in_Bb/Two_Forms

 they state that the facing curves on German mouthpieces are slightly concave which is really interesting.
 Unfortunately I am unable to get my hands on German mouthpieces to measure and confirm this because of where I live. 
 

 Does anyone have facing measurements of German or Reform Boehm mouthpieces that they would be willing to share? 
 

 

 Cheers,
 

 Harim Oh
