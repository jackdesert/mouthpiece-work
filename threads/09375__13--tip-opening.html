            <pre class='message__body'>Mornin&#39; all-

I have a client playing on a .165" tip JJ HR* tenor piece.  It is marked 10* but Jody opened this to 13*.  He wants his Link opened to a similar tip.  Just wondering what you might think the best facing length would be for something like this?  I assume a nearly radial curve would be necessary.  This is the most athletic tip I have been asked to do.

Thanks!

Matt

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks.  This was one of the pieces Jody made for George Garzone.  I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to measure it yet, just doing my homework...

            <pre class='message__body'>I think some tenor reed cuts will leak air out the sides at 54.  But most are OK 
there so I would try that with such an extreme tip opening.

If the facing length is something other than 50 or 52 it wasn&#39;t done at Jody&#39;s. 
 I would try and see if 50 to 54 would generate a decent curve for that size.
