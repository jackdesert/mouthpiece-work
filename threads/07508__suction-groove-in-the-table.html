            <pre class='message__body'>There was the big discussion here a few months ago on this.  The general consensus was that the concavity in some mouthpieces was a result of thermal expansion during tooling, and not a design characteristic.  I spoke to Wolfe Tanninbaum (Tayne) about this the other day and he said that he intentionally puts a dip in the table as he felt that it "trained" the reed as regards the break point.  He had an article on this in a recent Saxophone Journal issue.

From purely a marketing standpoint though, ask yourself if making the table flat is an advantage.  I&#39;d say that most people who own saxophones do not worry about flattening their water swollen reed.  Once their reed swells to a certain point and doesn&#39;t seal any longer on the flat table, they will complain, and then get a new reed.  The same person with a concave table, will be able to play much longer on the same swollen reed, before the seal goes.  They won&#39;t have to change reeds so often, and if they are smart enough to make the connection, they will inevitably come to the conclusion that for them, the mouthpiece with the concave table is by far the better mouthpiece.  

So, I guess determining which was ultimately better for the merchant would depend upon what he was selling, mouthpieces or reeds.
