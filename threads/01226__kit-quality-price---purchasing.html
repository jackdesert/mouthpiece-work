            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys. 
I am enjoying the topics in this group and, while I have done a 
search of the files section, didn&#39;t see an actual comparison of the 
different tools for refacing.  

Apart from good quality calipers which sould be readily available, 
do the kits that are listed (Morgan, Winslow, Babbitt) have all the 
tools needed to start?  Is there a significant relationship between 
the pricing and the quality of these kits?  Do people buy individual 
items as required or is it better to get a kit to start?
Thanks,
Ralph

            <pre class='message__body'>In addition to tools, paper, etc, the Winslow kit has three mouthpieces 
to work on.  The files in the Winslow kit are a little large in my 
opinion.  I use a narrower file that Lilly at Runyon Products gave me... 
but a similar file can be bought from www.micromark.com 
&lt;http://www.micromark.com/>.  The catalog is free, order one.

 

Items you might want to consider (and you can look online using these 
part numbers) for mouthpiece work:

 

14412 Contour gauge

80973 Dial Caliper  (I have one of these)

82556 Digital Caliper 

33108 Swiss Pattern File set

 

 

 

For general sax repair:

 

60361  Screw Checker Inch   gauge to ID size and threads of small screws

60345  Screw Checker Metric 

80821  Brass Caliper Metric and Inch  Perfect size for measure pads and 
pad cups

Various taps and dies in sizes useful for saxes, inch and metric, from 
00-90 thru 8-32 (neck screws)

82710  Microlux Lathe 7x14

82573  Microlux Milling Machine

82714  Microlux Machine Center (combines mill with lathe

80822  Stay-Brite solder 450F silver solder

17110  Tix Solder "hardest soft solder" 275 F

17111  Tix Flux

17112  Tix AntiFlux

81657  Handheld torch
