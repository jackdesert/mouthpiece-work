            <pre class='message__body'>  We&#39;ve got some solid brass mouthpieces that were not correctly engraved
that we can&#39;t sell. 
There is nothing wrong with them other than they say the wrong thing on the
shank. I&#39;ve got tenor, soprano, and sopranino. I&#39;ll sell them for $35 each +
shipping. MINIMUM ORDER IS FIVE, no singles!
There is a rough facing on them. The tables need slight leveling and the
tips opened to your liking. They play just like they are, but are perfect
for facing practice. I&#39;ve got about a hundred to sell. You can&#39;t get good
practice pieces for less......contact me via email off the list at
