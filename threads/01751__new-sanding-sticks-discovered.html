            <pre class='message__body'>Folks,

My other interest is in woodcarving - and I occasionally stumble onto
"woodcarving" tools that would be applicable to mouthpiece refacing.

Here&#39;s another: 
Cushioned Sanding Files

From MDIWoodcarvers.com:
"Firm plastic center with a thin layer of foam under a quality 
sanding film. This is a handy and comfortable tool to use, at an 
affordable price! Each sanding file is 7 inches long. Bright 
fluorescent colors allow for easy distinction between four available 
grits. Two different grits per file."

You can find them at:

http://www.mdiwoodcarvers.com/sanding.htm

They also have Swiss sanding cloth - 4" wide rolls, sanding
hearts, and Sanding detailers - with little moveable sanding
belts.

Also found at this site are dental probes, magnifiers, epoxies, etc.

Enjoy!

-Pete

            <pre class='message__body'>These are quite easy to make--I use something similar in making shakuhachi flutes. Just wrap a layer or two of thick double-sided tape (or more of thin double-sided tape) around a dowel of whatever dimension serves you--for fine work I use the butt end of precision files--then affix a small piece of sandpaper around that. You can easily replace the paper when it is clogged, and you can vary the amount of "padding" by more or less wraps of tape.

            <pre class='message__body'>These look neat.  I&#39;m tempted to try some, but I really do not have any
problems wrapping small pieces of sandpaper around various files and sticks
to get the job done.

Micro-Mark carries these too and has some better pictures.

OR www.micromark.com Item 81471

Look at their other sanding products.  It also looks like they have some of
that Mylar adheasive-backed sandpaper I&#39;m quite fond of.
