Here&#39;s something interesting.   The harder you blow, the more the reed closes and the less air enters the mouthpiece.  The only reason the reed vibrates at all, is because the pressure inside the mouthpiece forces the reed open, letting air in.  So it would appear as if the efficiency with which air pressure manipulates the reed would be more important than how air is channeled into the mouthpiece.  Why all the emphasis on airflow?

But I have been puzzled by graphs that show the reed tip gradually closing off more as you blow harder.  The graph shows that airflow is decreasing as you blow harder but the sensation is that you are using more air.

p is the standing wave.  It&#39;s a feedback loop.  P generates but also wants to shut off the U that causes reed motion.  p is the initial reed motion pressure feeding back upon itself after 2 transits of the air column (+ the mysterious Helmholtz thing it does in the chamber).  The more it feeds back without distortion and signal loss, the more it influences the reed&#39;s motion, enabling more U.

My problem is that I was looking at the U vs (P-p) plot as a U vs P plot assuming avg p would not change much.  So since there is a strong 3 parameter relationship going on, is
 there a better illustration published that shows how p varies?

p is the standing wave.  It&#39;s a feedback loop.  P generates but also wants to shut off the U that causes reed motion.  p is the initial reed motion pressure feeding back upon itself after 2 transits of the air column (+ the mysterious Helmholtz thing it does in the chamber).  The more it feeds back without distortion and signal loss, the more it influences the reed&#39;s motion, enabling more U.

Not all players want a really free-blowing mouthpiece either.  Most are willing to trade off blowing efficiency for gains in other areas like a darker more spread tone, if that is their sound concept.

I agree that air flow considerations should rank a lot lower than many mouthpiece makers and players think.

      I think there is emphasis on airflow because it has been a useful teaching aid.  



But I have been puzzled by graphs that show the reed tip gradually closing off more as you blow harder.  The graph shows that airflow is decreasing as you blow harder but the sensation is that you are using more air.

      I think of optimal reed and facing aspects as an assumed prerequisite, just as I assume the horn has correct venting and leak-free padding.  I use a model reed, establish my preferred facing for my model embouchure, and then go about adjusting chamber parameters to suite, whether the objective is a fee-blowing setup or something with slightly less efficiency, giving the player more tonal control. In any case, the focus is on pressure and pressure related particle flow, rather than the flow of blown air into the mouthpiece.

      This efficiency (for a free-blowing setup) depends mostly on the design and quality of the facing curve and reed.  Next, I think the baffle design near the tip is important.  Then the wall shape at the base of the window.  I would say throat geometry and sidewalls are forth on my list.  

Not all players want a really free-blowing mouthpiece either.  Most are willing to trade off blowing efficiency for gains in other areas like a darker more spread tone, if that is their sound concept.
I agree that air flow considerations should rank a lot lower than many mouthpiece makers and players think.

      So, the difference between a free-blowing mouthpiece and a resistant mouthpiece, is all about how efficiently pressure changes inside the mouthpiece can cause the reed to move at the speed of sound, not how the blown air wanders through the chamber/throat/neck tube at 30mph.   Analyze your chamber design from that perspective and you may get some new ideas.

      "So since there is a strong 3 parameter relationship going on, is there a better illustration published that shows how p varies?"

p is the standing wave.  It&#39;s a feedback loop.  P generates but also wants to shut off the U that causes reed motion.  p is the initial reed motion pressure feeding back upon itself after 2 transits of the air column (+ the mysterious Helmholtz thing it does in the chamber).  The more it feeds back without distortion and signal loss, the more it influences the reed&#39;s motion, enabling more U.

      I see.  So as the player increases mouth pressure P, mouthpiece pressure p increases even more when you feel you are using more air U.  
But with smaller tip openings (or made smaller with your bottom lip), P can increase at a greater rate than p and the reed can close off (U=0).  But the conditions needed for this crossover/reversal are probably more complex than just tip opening.  
My problem is that I was looking at the U vs (P-p) plot as a U vs P plot assuming avg p would not change much.  So since there is a strong 3 parameter relationship going on, is
 there a better illustration published that shows how p varies?

      "I think there is emphasis on airflow because it has been a useful teaching aid."

As with other similar, commonly employed teaching aids (eg., blowing fast air improves tone at p dynamic levels), I grew up hearing and using them as much as anyone else, and they work, to a point.  Nothing has improved every aspect of my playing and even more-so my work on mouthpieces, as much or as rapidly as having an accurate child&#39;s "picture book" grasp of what is actually going on.  This is the information age and the Truth really will set you free.  

It&#39;s a good teaching aid for beginners, but after a point it will only hold you back.

"But I have been puzzled by graphs that show the reed tip gradually 
closing off more as you blow harder.  The graph shows that airflow is 
decreasing as you blow harder but the sensation is that you are using 
more air."

The graph is always labeled with flow (u) on the vertical axis and pressure (P-p) on the horizontal axis.  "P" = blowing pressure in the mouth.  "p" = pressure inside the mouthpiece.  On a scale of 1 - 10 of blowing pressure, if we blow steadily at 10 and the pressure inside the mouthpiece is 0, the graph shows the air flow is 0, which it is, as the reed closes and stays closed.  If we have + pressure of 5 inside the mouthpiece as the - pressure wave from the open tone hole/bell reflects at the reed with inversion, the pressure on the reed is now 10 - 5 = 5, so the reed is allowed to open to that degree (dependent upon reed strength) and a certain amount of that force 10 blown air, enters the mouthpiece.  For any given blowing pressure, the higher the mouthpiece pressure on the one side of the reed, the more it counteracts the blowing pressure on the other side of the reed, the wider the reed opens, and the more
 air goes into the mouthpiece.

So, no matter how hard you are blowing, the only reason any air enters the mouthpiece is because there is a pressure build-up on the other side of the reed that allows it to open.  From the mouthpiece design standpoint, how accurately and to what intensity, changes in pressure occur directly under the reed at the speed of sound  - how efficiently that pressure controls the reed - are of more importance than how the little puffs of air that enter the mouthpiece traveling at.......what?   30 mph, flow into the chamber, throat, and bore.

As with other similar, commonly employed teaching aids (eg., blowing fast air improves tone at p dynamic levels), I grew up hearing and using them as much as anyone else, and they work, to a point.  Nothing has improved every aspect of my playing and even more-so my work on mouthpieces, as much or as rapidly as having an accurate child&#39;s "picture book" grasp of what is actually going on.  This is the information age and the Truth really will set you free.  

It&#39;s a good teaching aid for beginners, but after a point it will only hold you back.

"But I have been puzzled by graphs that show the reed tip gradually 
closing off more as you blow harder.  The graph shows that airflow is 
decreasing as you blow harder but the sensation is that you are using 
more air."

The graph is always labeled with flow (u) on the vertical axis and pressure (P-p) on the horizontal axis.  "P" = blowing pressure in the mouth.  "p" = pressure inside the mouthpiece.  On a scale of 1 - 10 of blowing pressure, if we blow steadily at 10 and the pressure inside the mouthpiece is 0, the graph shows the air flow is 0, which it is, as the reed closes and stays closed.  If we have + pressure of 5 inside the mouthpiece as the - pressure wave from the open tone hole/bell reflects at the reed with inversion, the pressure on the reed is now 10 - 5 = 5, so the reed is allowed to open to that degree (dependent upon reed strength) and a certain amount of that force 10 blown air, enters the mouthpiece.  For any given blowing pressure, the higher the mouthpiece pressure on the one side of the reed, the more it counteracts the blowing pressure on the other side of the reed, the wider the reed opens, and the more
 air goes into the mouthpiece.

So, no matter how hard you are blowing, the only reason any air enters the mouthpiece is because there is a pressure build-up on the other side of the reed that allows it to open.  From the mouthpiece design standpoint, how accurately and to what intensity, changes in pressure occur directly under the reed at the speed of sound  - how efficiently that pressure controls the reed - are of more importance than how the little puffs of air that enter the mouthpiece traveling at.......what?   30 mph, flow into the chamber, throat, and bore.

But I have been puzzled by graphs that show the reed tip gradually closing off more as you blow harder.

I can articulate how to adjust facing curves for blowing resistance.  Can you explain why you choose to leave the curve alone and adjust the chamber instead?  How do you deal with changes in the tone that may go off target?

Changing other things (shape of the curve, anything about the chamber) changes the sound and/or response more than just a bit smaller or larger tip does.

            <pre class='message__body'>Player A gets a characteristic saxophone tone and is enamored with what he considers his ability to accent, and begin and end phrases "neatly" by manipulating his throat to control the air flow.  

Player B learned years ago, that such
 "throat playing" is actually indicative of a total lack of embouchure/tonal control at
 anything other than a f - ff dynamic level, and like all other serious saxophone players, before and since, strove to eliminate any hint of such throat manipulation tendencies from his playing.  In doing so, a whole world of professional playing experiences became his, which Player A would never have, as, there isn&#39;t
 one thing that will get you tossed out of any professional playing 
opportunity faster (other than not showing up) than, "using your throat".

So, what works fine for Player A for one reason in his circumstance, Player B will avoid at all costs for another in his.  The former will have nothing to say regarding tone that the latter could possibly find of interest.  The latter can say nothing on tone that the former is capable of understanding.  What a mess!  Where is Ego doing the talking?

Regardless of what our player&#39;s artistic requirements are, the mouthpiece facing has to do 3 things.  

1. provide an air-tight seal against the reed
2. provide a springy feel/response so the player can easily control the frequency of the reed&#39;s resonance over the range required for correct playing.
3. allow the reed to roll up the facing and close in a manner that is energy efficient and results in musically interesting tone qualities. 
 

In #3, I differentiate between mechanical resistance (stress/flexing) and acoustical resistance.  I use the facing to control mechanical resistance - the way the model reed responds to P (air pressure in the mouth) in the absence of p.  I use very, very fine baffle adjustments to control acoustical resistance (once the other main considerations have been set) - the way the model reed responds to p in the presence of P, or P - p. That gives me the mouthpiece results I want for my playing demands.  

I work with machine tools and hand scrape flat surfaces to .0005" accuracy (in 12").   While I find mouthpiece facings interesting, I don&#39;t consider them mysterious at all.

      Maybe I (we) should have a more open mind.  One or both of us might learn something.  That is really how these forums are intended to be used.  But too often egos get in the way.
I can articulate how to adjust facing curves for blowing resistance.  Can you explain why you choose to leave the curve alone and adjust the chamber instead?  How do you deal with changes in the tone that may go off target?

      Obviously that is what works for you as the audio files demonstrate.  IME there may come a point in a player&#39;s development where the facing and reed aspects alone are not sufficient to 
satisfy the player&#39;s demands.

      So you adjust the chamber to get the blowing resistance goal?   I find changing the reed and/or the facing curve shape is best for this.  That would make facing optimal in my book.

      I think of optimal reed and facing aspects as an assumed prerequisite, just as I assume the horn has correct venting and leak-free padding.  I use a model reed, establish my preferred facing for my model embouchure, and then go about adjusting chamber parameters to suite, whether the objective is a fee-blowing setup or something with slightly less efficiency, giving the player more tonal control.

      This efficiency (for a free-blowing setup) depends mostly on the design and quality of the facing curve and reed.  Next, I think the baffle design near the tip is important.  Then the wall shape at the base of the window.  I would say throat geometry and sidewalls are forth on my list.  

Not all players want a really free-blowing mouthpiece either.  Most are willing to trade off blowing efficiency for gains in other areas like a darker more spread tone, if that is their sound concept.
I agree that air flow considerations should rank a lot lower than many mouthpiece makers and players think.

p is the standing wave.  It&#39;s a feedback loop.  P generates but also wants to shut off the U that causes reed motion.  p is the initial reed motion pressure feeding back upon itself after 2 transits of the air column (+ the mysterious Helmholtz thing it does in the chamber).  The more it feeds back without distortion and signal loss, the more it influences the reed&#39;s motion, enabling more U.

      I see.  So as the player increases mouth pressure P, mouthpiece pressure p increases even more when you feel you are using more air U.  
But with smaller tip openings (or made smaller with your bottom lip), P can increase at a greater rate than p and the reed can close off (U=0).  But the conditions needed for this crossover/reversal are probably more complex than just tip opening.  
My problem is that I was looking at the U vs (P-p) plot as a U vs P plot assuming avg p would not change much.  So since there is a strong 3 parameter relationship going on, is
 there a better illustration published that shows how p varies?

1. provide an air-tight seal against the reed
 
Clear.  This can be done independent of "2" and "3" below.
 
2. provide a springy feel/response so the player can easily control the frequency of the reed&#39;s resonance over the range required for correct playing.
 
Do you adjust for "2" before moving on to "3" below or do you do them together?  I&#39;m thinking together.
 
3. allow the reed to roll up the facing and close in a manner that is energy efficient and results in musically interesting tone qualities. 
 
For "mechanical resistance" vs P efficiency, do you blow the mouthpiece off the sax in an attempt to evaluate with p=0?
 
For "acoustical resistance" vs P-p efficiency, are you primarily adjusting a roll-over baffle shape?  I think some rafacers call this adjustment "proper venting".  Veturi effects can be a big deal here as you know.  Now we have air velocity consideration, which is manipulated by.... Airflow.

            <pre class='message__body'>Player A/B sit together:  In some leagues, player A might be lucky enough to make one short appearance, but would then never be seen (heard) again.  I&#39;m aware that there are other levels of musical pursuit where professionals and amateurs regularly co-mingle.  Regardless, amongst professionals, the only thing worse than a throat player, is a throat player that thinks throat playing sounds good. Player A would have no chance of getting qualified for a performance degree study program using that method, regardless of what facing his mouthpiece had, and indubidably, he would make better mouthpieces (if he were to make mouthpieces) if his method of evaluation employed the universally accepted "correct" playing techniques.  Perhaps it could be used as a marketing ploy however to appeal to the broad consumer base sharing the same characteristics.

Springy
 Feel:  Funny question.  Of course the entire facing must be completed before any single part of it (other than table flatness) can be tested.  The first ca. 1/3 of the curve (from the break) provides me with the reed frequency control that I require.

Test P:  One can fill the mouthpiece with cotton to test blow for mechanical resistance, but I don&#39;t bother.  I have the P facing that works for me and simply remain aware of the difference between adjusting mechanical resistance and adjusting acoustical resistance:

1. any facing adjustment alters both mechanical AND acoustical resistance at the same time.  

2. baffle adjustments affect acoustical resistance only. Whether you attribute the reed snapping closed to a Bernoulli effect of 30mph blown air, or to the fact that speed of sound, air pressure changes under the reed in a narrow space cause it to move faster than air pressure changes in a wider space, where there is more air compliance, I
 classify either  as an acoustical factor.  I consider "venting" of air flow a conceptual error.

As to using facing adjustments exclusively - I don&#39;t see how sacrificing individual control of each parameter could 
be advantageous, other than being a "quick and dirty" solution, or unless you deal exclusively with flat-baffle pieces where the baffle shape is fixed. (and flat is not always really flat, as machinists know - another non facing adjustment that has profound effects).

In 40 years of playing and working on mouthpieces, every brand, model, facing (stock or custom - the names we know), what I have learned is that the facing (regardless of how sophisticated you make it) is only the beginning of getting things to really work. Many players are satisfied with that to some degree, though they invariably continue searching for another mouthpiece solution.  With me, in every case, I have to make additional fine baffle adjustments to separately match the acoustical resistance to the chosen facing&#39;s set mechanical resistance, to get the mouthpiece to do what I want.  The results are immediately noticed by player and listener alike, and that is what someone willing to pay $1000 for a mouthpiece is trying to buy.

Maybe Player A and Player B both agree that the world is flat?  They probably sit next to each other at some gigs.
 
1. provide an air-tight seal against the reed
 
Clear.  This can be done independent of "2" and "3" below.
 
2. provide a springy feel/response so the player can easily control the frequency of the reed&#39;s resonance over the range required for correct playing.
 
Do you adjust for "2" before moving on to "3" below or do you do them together?  I&#39;m thinking together.
 
3. allow the reed to roll up the facing and close in a manner that is energy efficient and results in musically interesting tone qualities. 
 
For "mechanical resistance" vs P efficiency, do you blow the mouthpiece off the sax in an attempt to evaluate with p=0?
 
For "acoustical resistance" vs P-p efficiency, are you primarily adjusting a roll-over baffle shape?  I think some rafacers call this adjustment "proper venting".  Veturi effects can be a big deal here as you know.  Now we have air velocity consideration, which is manipulated by.... Airflow.

Player A gets a characteristic saxophone tone and is enamored with what he considers his ability to accent, and begin and end phrases "neatly" by manipulating his throat to control the air flow.  

Player B learned years ago, that such "throat playing" is actually indicative of a total lack of embouchure/tonal control at anything other than a f - ff dynamic level, and like all other serious saxophone players, before and since, strove to eliminate any hint of such throat manipulation tendencies from his playing.  In doing so, a whole world of professional playing experiences became his, which Player A would never have, as, there isn&#39;t one thing that will get you tossed out of any professional playing opportunity faster (other than not showing up) than, "using your throat".

So, what works fine for Player
 A
 for one reason in his circumstance, Player B will avoid at all costs for another in his.  The former will have nothing to say regarding tone that the latter could possibly find of interest.  The latter can say nothing on tone that the former is capable of understanding.  What a mess!  Where is Ego doing the talking?

Regardless of what our player&#39;s artistic requirements are, the mouthpiece facing has to do 3 things.  

1. provide an air-tight seal against the reed
2. provide a springy feel/response so the player can easily control the frequency of the reed&#39;s resonance over the range required for correct playing.
3. allow the reed to roll up the facing and close in a manner that is energy efficient and results in musically interesting tone qualities.  

In #3, I differentiate between mechanical resistance (stress/flexing) and acoustical resistance.  I use the facing to control mechanical
 resistance - the way the model reed responds to P (air pressure in the mouth) in the absence of p.  I use very, very fine baffle adjustments to control acoustical resistance (once the other main considerations have been set) - the way the model reed responds to p in the presence of P, or P - p. That gives me the mouthpiece results I want for my playing demands.  

I work with machine tools and hand scrape flat surfaces to .0005" accuracy (in 12").   While I find mouthpiece facings interesting, I don&#39;t consider them mysterious at all.

Maybe I (we) should have a more open mind.  One or both of us might learn something.  That is really how these forums are intended to be used.  But too often egos get in the way.
 
I can articulate how to adjust facing curves for blowing resistance.  Can you explain why you choose to leave the curve alone and adjust the chamber instead?  How do you deal with changes in the tone that may go off target?

Obviously that is what works for you as the audio files demonstrate.  IME there may come a point in a player&#39;s development where the facing and reed aspects alone are not sufficient to 
satisfy the player&#39;s demands.

So you adjust the chamber to get the blowing resistance goal?   I find changing the reed and/or the facing curve shape is best for this.  That would make facing optimal in my book.

I think of optimal reed and facing aspects as an assumed prerequisite, just as I assume the horn has correct venting and leak-free padding.  I use a model reed, establish my preferred facing for my model embouchure, and then go about adjusting chamber parameters to suite, whether the objective is a fee-blowing setup or something with slightly less efficiency, giving the player more tonal control. In any case, the focus is on pressure and pressure related particle flow, rather than the flow of blown air into the mouthpiece.

This efficiency (for a free-blowing setup) depends mostly on the design and quality of the facing curve and reed.  Next, I think the baffle design near the tip is important.  Then the wall shape at the base of the window.  I would say throat geometry and sidewalls are forth on my list.   
Not all players want a really free-blowing mouthpiece either.  Most are willing to trade off blowing efficiency for gains in other areas like a darker more spread tone, if that is their sound concept.
 
I agree that air flow considerations should rank a lot lower than many mouthpiece makers and players think.

So, the difference between a free-blowing mouthpiece and a resistant mouthpiece, is all about how efficiently pressure changes inside the mouthpiece can cause the reed to move at the speed of sound, not how the blown air wanders through the chamber/throat/neck tube at 30mph.   Analyze your chamber design from that perspective and you may get some new ideas.

"So since there is a strong 3 parameter relationship going on, is there a better illustration published that shows how p varies?"

p is the standing wave.  It&#39;s a feedback loop.  P generates but also wants to shut off the U that causes reed motion.  p is the initial reed motion pressure feeding back upon itself after 2 transits of the air column (+ the mysterious Helmholtz thing it does in the chamber).  The more it feeds back without distortion and signal loss, the more it influences the reed&#39;s motion, enabling more U.

I see.  So as the player increases mouth pressure P, mouthpiece pressure p increases even more when you feel you are using more air U.  


But with smaller tip openings (or made smaller with your bottom lip), P can increase at a greater rate than p and the reed can close off (U=0).  But the conditions needed for this crossover/reversal are probably more complex than just tip opening.  


My problem is that I was looking at the U vs (P-p) plot as a U vs P plot assuming avg p would not change much.  So since there is a strong 3 parameter relationship going on, is there a better illustration published that shows how p varies?
