            <pre class='message__body'>If so, I would like to hear from you (privately, please, at
saxgourmet@...).
I&#39;m NOT going to try to sell you anything, and this is NOT about making
sales appointments. We would like to entertain some of the participants on
Saturday night, when NAPBIRT does not have a dinner meeting
scheduled.....nothing more

The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
