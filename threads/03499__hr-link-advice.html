            <pre class='message__body'>Before you give up on that Link, try it with a 1 or 1 1/2 reed.  That is 
often all that is needed to make those open MPs playable, even if your 
chops aren&#39;t what they once were :-) . As a bonus, sometimes you can get 
boxes of these low number reeds dirt cheap. Also, the bari synthetics 
allow tailoring the reed with fine sandpaper and glass. You may have a 
more playable MP than you thought. JimG
