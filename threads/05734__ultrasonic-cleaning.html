            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

Your link to otto frei&#39;s website led me to find a small ultrasonic 
cleaning rig (tank is 6" long, should fit even bari mouthpieces) for a 
very attractive price.  It would be nice to send mouthpieces off to 
clients in a super-sparkly-clean condition.  Any advice or info about 
this process?   Is it just a final cleanup process, or does it remove 
serious gunk as well?  (I assume you can use this process on HR and 
metal mouthpieces.)  Thanks.

It will not clean off calcium deposits.  I mostly use it for final cleaning
on all mouthpieces.

I just use a little squeeze of dish detergent.  I never tried anything
else.

- when it says to change the solution "often", every "x number"
ofcleanings? every x number of days?

When you see stuff growing and floating in it, change it.

- doesn&#39;t damage hard rubber, bite plates, epoxy baffles, (other?),true?

True.
