            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

Your link to otto frei&#39;s website led me to find a small ultrasonic 
cleaning rig (tank is 6" long, should fit even bari mouthpieces) for a 
very attractive price.  It would be nice to send mouthpieces off to 
clients in a super-sparkly-clean condition.  Any advice or info about 
this process?   Is it just a final cleanup process, or does it remove 
serious gunk as well?  (I assume you can use this process on HR and 
metal mouthpieces.)  Thanks.

Dan T

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a small ultrasonic cleaner.  Got it from Micro-Mark on sale but the
non-sale price is good too.  ~$80?

It will not clean off calcium deposits.  I mostly use it for final cleaning
on all mouthpieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Just got the $40 ultrasonic cleaner from Otto Frei - haven't used it yet. Some
questions:  
  
\\- can you use (as the instructions say) a small amount of dish detergent
instead of the special solution, or is it worth it to just get the special
stuff?  
\\- when it says to change the solution "often", every "x number" of
cleanings? every x number of days?  
\\- doesn't damage hard rubber, bite plates, epoxy baffles, (other?), true?  
  
Thanks. Can't wait to get some mouthpieces sparkly clean.

I just use a little squeeze of dish detergent.  I never tried anything
else.

- when it says to change the solution "often", every "x number"
ofcleanings? every x number of days?

When you see stuff growing and floating in it, change it.

- doesn&#39;t damage hard rubber, bite plates, epoxy baffles, (other?),true?

True.
