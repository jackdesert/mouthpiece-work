            <pre class='message__body'>Viruses, while possible on yahoo, are not probable.  Yahoo has extensive
virus scanning, and it is seldom that an email can come through with a
virus attached, unless it is extremely new.  From what I know of Yahoo,
it is very safe to use.  If you use Yahoo email, any attachments you
send are scanned as they are uploaded.

No one should be on the net these days without a good anti-virus
program.  As it has the best interface, and in my experience with other
programs, too, the best protection, I advise Norton AV.  Yes, I will
name names� Norton is much better than McAfee.  McAfee has let through
viruses that Norton stopped.  But AV programs are only good if you
update the virus definitions often.  I do it at least twice a week,
sometimes three or four times a week.

If you use a cable modem, where you are online all the time, or even a
dial up modem, you also need a good firewall.  The two top rated ones
are Zonealarm (www.zonelabs.com) and Black Ice.  If you look on the
site, there is ZoneAlarm Pro, which has a moderate cost, and a free
version for non commercial users.  You may have to look around for the
free version, but it is there.  This also stops a lot of email with
viruses.  The free one works just fine.

There are armies of 13 yr old punks with automatic programs sniffing
around your computer�s ports, looking for a way in so they can turn your
computer into a �bot� (robot or slave), to do their dirty work� like
hundreds or thousands of slave computers, waiting for the command from
them to send out continuous pings to a site they have chosen for a
�denial of service attack.�  They overload the system, and some business
or person is overloaded, cannot use the net.  They do this kind of thing
for fun.  Or they download your personal info.  Zonealarm will also
prevent spyware or a Trojan horse put in your computer by a hacker from
accessing the net without you knowing.  You will be surprised at the
number of games, and other programs (RealPlayer,etc) that try to access
the net by themselves.  In case you think I exaggerate, I have been
pinged repeatedly by Bugaria, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and even
Beijing.

And another precaution� many viruses take advantage of Windows scripting
(Visual Basic Scripting) to make copies and do its dirty work.  Never
open attachments with two or more extensions, esp ones with .vbs
extensions (example, saxpicture.jpg.vbs or goodmusic.mp3.vbs).  You can
safely turn off Visual Basic Scripting, there is a tool to do that
called Noscript.  You can download this from Symantec, the parent
company of Norton AV.  You simply double click on this tiny program and
it allows you to disable or enable scripting.  This will help limit the
damage from VBS based viruses.

One more thing, go to www.lavasoftusa.com and download (free) Adaware.
This will scan your computer for �spyware�, which reports your surfing
habits back to God knows who.  They spy on you and target ads at you.
Run Adaware at least weekly.  It can also be set to run automatically.

Zonealarm, Adaware, and Noscript are FREE and effective tools.  There is
no reason not to have them.  And Norton Anti Virus is a cost of going
online.

Oh, those cute exe�s that your friends sent you, �Hey, this is really
funny, take a look!�  Well, delete those emails as fast as you get them,
and never click on those attachments.  And when your friends send you
Word attachments, make sure the body of the email mentions the
attachment, your name, and the senders name, and not a vague one like
�This is the file you requested, I am sending you this file�.   I feel
safer opening an attachment when I know I requested such a thing.  If
not sure, write the sender.  And like VD, just cause they are nice
people and you know them well, does not mean they don�t have a virus.

I hope these tips will help keep your computer virus-free.  I have not
had a problem in quite a long time.
