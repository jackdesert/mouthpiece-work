            <pre class='message__body'>A friend asked me to work on a Pomarico Jazz crystal clarinet mouthpiece.  It was about 1.45 tip opening and it was too much work for him.   Not being that experienced working on crystal I finally had some success with 120 paper.  The finer stuff just didn&#39;t cut enough for me.  As I closed down the tip opening by lengthening the table and shortening the facing the mouthpiece started to work pretty nicely.  As it stands it is  26, 18, 12, 7 with a tip of 1.28mm.   I&#39;m not seeing any drawbacks in the way it plays(tone, response and control).  Would anyone else use numbers like this for a clarinet mouthpiece?  Additionally does anyone regularly face a mouthpiece and leave the first two facing numbers until the end... in the numbers above that would be the 26 and 18. Adjusting and tweaking these until things worked with the rest of the facing      thanks
