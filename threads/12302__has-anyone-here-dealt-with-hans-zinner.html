            <pre class='message__body'>  I contacted Zinner a couple weeks ago inquiring about purchasing unfinished blanks and I have yet to get any response.  I;ve sent follow-up emails since then as well with nada.

  Has anyone else here had any business dealings with Zinner or know if they will sell blanks to anyone that wants them?    

Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think I tried once years ago too.  Same experience.   You may need to work through a German liaison.

            <pre class='message__body'>Muncy Winds used to carry blanks.  I go directly to Zinner, but am buying in high volume for my mouthpiece business.  You pay for international shipping, USA import taxes and possibly your State import taxes.  It is not much cheaper than buying a few from Phil Muncy!
