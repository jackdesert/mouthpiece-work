            <pre class='message__body'>  I contacted Zinner a couple weeks ago inquiring about purchasing unfinished blanks and I have yet to get any response.  I;ve sent follow-up emails since then as well with nada.

  Has anyone else here had any business dealings with Zinner or know if they will sell blanks to anyone that wants them?    

Thanks.

You pay for international shipping, USA import taxes and possibly your State import taxes.  It is not much cheaper than buying a few from Phil Muncy!
