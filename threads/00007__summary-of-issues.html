...Here&#39;s the point.

Most of the literature on woodwind acoustics discusses a "missing cone" at the end of a saxophone.

From Benade we know that two requirements must be met for the saxophone to work properly.

1.  The "effective" volume of the mouthpiece must closely match the volume of the missing cone.

2.  The frequency (pitch) played by the mouthpiece + neck (Frs) must be the same as the calculated frequency 
      of the missing cone + neck. 

Here&#39;s the challenge.

- Except for Ferron&#39;s Saxophone is My Voice there is no mention in the literature of how to actually find the volume of the missing cone or it&#39;s length.  

-There is nowhere in the literature that includes studies of matching mouthpiece "effective" volume to that of a missing cone.

-There is nowhere in the literature that includes measurements of the Frs of various saxophone necks with various mouthpieces.

-There is only a brief mention in Benade&#39;s text of how to determine the "effective" volume of a mouthpiece, which very basically means the volume added by the vibration of the reed and the player&#39;s mouth to the geometric volume inside the mouthpiece.

Here is whyI believe this information is important

-It is common knowledge that some modern mouthpieces with a long narrow shank play out of tune on older instruments.  Measuring and testing Benade&#39;s requirements with different mouthpieces on the necks of these instruments can offer solutions, or better still provide a scientific description for why a solution found by trial and error works.

-Knowing that the chamber and shank each have a very different role in the interior geometry of a mouthpiece,  having a clear understanding of the overall volume required by that particular mouthpiece can help the mouthpiece maker/refacer to balance those volumes without changing the intonation characteristics of the mouthpiece.

-Some problems players experience with mouthpieces are "pilot error" and not a fault of the equipment.  A clear understanding of mouthpiece pitch and its role in meeting Benade&#39;s requirements can go a long way to helping customers/students overcome these types of problems.

-Some mouthpieces produce a "warble" on some models of saxophones.  The typical approach is to blindly do trial and error until the problem goes away.  The key to understanding the cause of the warble and therefore its solution, I believe lies in better understanding the mouthpiece substitution for the missing cone.

-There are dozens of other ideas, but this should get the point across.   Let me know if you have any further questions.
