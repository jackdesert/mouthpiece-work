            <pre class='message__body'>  Sharon and I survived the show.....and had a great time. The attendance
was WAY off....you could swing a cat in the aisles.....I&#39;ve been attending
the show since the mid 1980&#39;s and have never seen so few people....a photo
ID was required EVERY time you entered the hall, so the bogus attendees were
kept out......if you didn&#39;t have proper credentials, you simply didn&#39;t get
in......we visited every saxophone and saxophone related booth at the show,
and frankly saw very little that was new.....Rheuben Allen had some really
nice innovative horns, Selmer showed a much improved LaVoix, Mauriat had a
couple of interesting new models, and Theo Wanne had some spectacular new
mouthpieces. International Woodwind showed everything from a Tubax to a
soprillo, and I really embarrassed myself trying to play them.....Sharon and
I held meetings with executives from Conn-Selmer, Yamaha, Antigua, F.E.
Olds, Mauriat, Jody Jazz, Oleg Products, Saxrax, Keilwerth, Buffet, Amati,
Unison, Cannonball, Getzen, J. J. Babbitt, Prestini, BG, Marca, BAM, SKB,
and many other manufacturers, and I think we left with a good feel for what
is going on in the industry.....Of course, we spent most of our time (and
some really FINE dinners!) with our vendors and have worked out all the
production schedules and pricing for the Voodoo Rex, the Super 400, the new
Saxgourmet baritone, and the new Saxgourmet curved soprano. We also
finalized the deals for our new line of cases and our Saxgourmet neck straps
and are considering some other accessory products.....we talked to quite a
few retailers and got a feel for what is going on in that end of the
business (it&#39;s not pretty)........our webmeister and People&#39;s Kommisar of
Propaganda Eddy Foster was there at the show with us and got some good ideas
on how to promote our products in the future......we were also joined by a
number of our endorsing artists who helped spread the good word about
Saxgourmet products around the show.....we made a few videos and took lots
of pictures which I will post later today......I think I can honestly report
that the state of health of the industry is wobbly at best.....I can also
report that our friends in Asia are continuing to lead the way in quality
and innovation while the rest of the industry sits on their collective
hands.....a number of regular participants in the show were conspicuous in
their absence.......we&#39;re very comfortable with what is going on with our
company and our vendors. We will be introducing all new saxophone models
this year, will discontinue some lines, expand our accessory offerings
(particularly  mouthpieces and necks), increase our retail presence through
direct sales to the end user, and strive to lead the industry in innovation
and creative design and to set the standard for quality.
