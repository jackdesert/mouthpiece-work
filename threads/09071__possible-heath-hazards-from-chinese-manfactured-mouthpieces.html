            <pre class='message__body'>As a matter of full disclosure, my company Saxgourmet Products buys some
mouthpiece blanks in China (and also Taiwan and the USA). We do NOT buy any
blanks from ANY source that are plated. All plating is done either in New
Orleans or Phoenix, Az. The brass used in the Chinese and Taiwanese blanks
is sourced in Japan. The hard rubber we use is sourced in the USA.
 

There&#39;s a reason they call it the Saxophone Misinformation Site. They
haven&#39;t a clue what they are talking about. Arsenic poisoning is simply not
an issue in the musical instrument industry in China or anywhere else.
That&#39;s just not the way the plating process works. Neither is brass
poisoning, also referenced on the Saxophone Misinformation Site. Look at the
plumbing fixtures that deliver drinking water to your home. They&#39;re usually
brass.

The only sort of evidence worth paying attention to would be to have an independent laboratory do chemical composition analysis of the substrate as well as the plating layer(s).  And when I say "independent", I mean undisputable testing which is arranged and paid for by a completely independent entity - not the manufacturer or anyone associated with the sale of the product being tested.

Until chemical composition analyses were routinely being performed with the results publicly available and reviewed, I see nothing wrong with people being cautious.  Given the perennial safety recalls for products made in China, I&#39;d say that anyone voicing concern is far from being an alarmist - throwing another log on the bonfire, maybe...

And I believe that it&#39;s cyanide that can be residual with plating operations, though it probably depends on the scale of the operation and what process is being used.

FDA requirements for food safety may be of interest:

http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodSafety/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/FoodCode2009/UCM188545.pdf

The notes on the use of copper and brass in an acidic environment suggests that brass mouthpieces that have been plated may be safer than those that have not been plated, but then you have to consider what chemicals are used in the plating process and to what extent any dangerous chemicals linger within or under the plating.

The question of "what is safe/unsafe" becomes clearer if you review metal toxicity charts, but you would have to play a mouthpiece for a very long time to ingest several milligrams of brass/copper/trace lead, etc.

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not know anything about the composition of the brass
used with metal mouthpieces. So do you have information that states that the manufacturer
or testing has showed that your assertions are correct?

Supposition:
Moving forward, If your assertions are correct does that mean that we could
deduce that the older Otto Link mouthpieces where the plating has worn off
would place the user in a form of risk for lead poising?

I would be interested in this.  I have noticed that some of the older Links sand redder than the current ones, but I don&#39;t know from when, or what that means (aside from more copper, I guess).

  I would be interested in this. I have noticed that some of the older Links sand redder than the current ones, but I don&#39;t know from when, or what that means (aside from more copper, I guess).

Most mouthpiece replaters will have you remove the biteplate or any added baffle as a precaution against cyanide taking up residence in the cracks.  Baffle additions should be made after the plating process.

            <pre class='message__body'>I dont think Cyanide is allowed in the US for plating anymore.  Or, it is so heavily regulated by OSHA that most now choose plating processes that do not use it.

            <pre class='message__body'>To comply with the current OSHA and EPA regulations (not to mention local regulations) the average shop would have to spend around $100,000. Plating itself is really not rocket science (the trick is in the preparation of the surface to be plated) but the onerous regulations keep many people out of the business, at least on a commercial basis. You can get pretty acceptable results with a high quality brush plater (not a cheap one, but a commercial one. BIG difference!), which is what we use at our shop for touch ups. I would think the average amateur refacer would be happy with the results you get with this type equipment. A good source is Rio Grande Tools. I also understand that Carswell Plating has some "home" kits, but I have not used their products, so I have no opinion about them, good or bad.

            <pre class='message__body'>I used Casswell&#39;s Silver Brush Plating kit to silverplate a key I&#39;d repaired on a 1920&#39;s Martin. The part quickly went from bare brass to silver. The current must have been a little high for this job as the silver went on black. However, it took almost no effort to polish it out and match the rest of the keywork. I was pleasantly surprised with the results.
