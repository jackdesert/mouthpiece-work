            <pre class='message__body'>Several issues at play regarding the clarinet mpc question,
probably one of the largest is that there are far less variations
on acceptable clarinet tone than there are of acceptable saxophone
tones.  

Regarding the clarinet mpc on the sax, there&#39;s lot of
bastardization going on out there, some things work for some
individuals and that is cool.

Clarinet players can be just as neurotic as sax players regarding
mpcs, believe me, I lived with two of them!  They always wound up
sounding the same after every "revelation."

Maybe another way of putting it, if we got rid of all of the
non-classical tones of the saxophones, we would see a lot less of
the mouthpiece issue for saxes as well.

I&#39;m a bit confused about the use of the term "classical sound," especially in regard to the saxophone. In the context of clarinet, I might be inclined to use "conservatory" rather than "classical."
