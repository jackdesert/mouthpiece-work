Here are a few ideas.  The Vandoren Jumbo Java has a baffle like a Dukoff
D, but is made of HR.  Guardala Laser Trimmed Studios are close as are a
few others.  Oleg Maestro is one.  I have not seen them all.  Some SR Techs
are probably close.

Pillinger in the UK will copy mouthpieces in cast Bronze.

The Nickel Plated Dukoffs hold up a little better.  It might be cheaper
just to keep buying low cost Dukoffs.

I could probably get you a custom one out of brass with a plating of your
choice.  But expect it to take a couple months and cost $350-$500.

            <pre class='message__body'>Heres another idea and what I did. If you can find one of the old L.A 
sax metal pieces it has a very similar baffle design as the dukoff. 
You will have to have it refaced and the chamber enlarged if you want 
the D chamber vibe, but it is a good start and you can find them 
pretty cheap.
