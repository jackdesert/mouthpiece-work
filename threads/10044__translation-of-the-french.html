            <pre class='message__body'>Guys, I will translate the French post:

I am a Bb clarinetist, and I would like to understand what makes the quality of a mouthpiece, and how to adapt a mouthpiece to my needs. Right now I am using several mouthpieces:  a Vandoren RV5, 2 B45 (points?), Perrier A, Selmer C85 120, Britone xxx xx.  (note from translator: I can&#39;t vouch for the model nos.)

I have compared the B45w. They sound different. The one has a more round sound and sounds very good in the high notes. The rails are identical and the interior form seems identical.

What are the aspects I should pay attention to?

Thanks in advance for your help.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the translation. I would answer that the interior form &#39;seeming&#39; identical is not an adequate analysis. Very small differences of the interior geometry, sometimes on the order of tenths of millimeters, is enough to create perceptible and even dramatic changes in timbre and response. I would say that the rails are not identical, that is impossible. And in the rails tiny differences are also very significant.

Adapting mpcs is often best left to experts; they are very easy to ruin, and knowing how to work on them and predicting the effects of modification takes lots of experience.

Becoming overrun by French clarinetists?
This group becoming bilingual/trilingual/polyglot?

Let&#39;s cross that bridge when we come to it.

There&#39;s always online translation (although it is pretty pathetic for the
most part, it&#39;s bound to get better.)

Anyway, why not become more cunning linguists!

Melting pot, yes. Sausage grinder, no.

My 2 cents.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, your prejudice is showing. This is nothing to do with common
courtesy, they have not been rude by using a language you do not understand.

There isn&#39;t necessarily a group anywhere in the world about mouthpiece
modifications AND with a primary language of French. I don&#39;t recall reading
any rule when I signed up here that I had to post in one language.

I read plenty of groups where people post in different languages. Generally
if there is someone who can read and translate, the question gets answered.
If not, the person presumably looks elsewhere.

I&#39;m glad to help, if I know the language. Otherwise, I just flip to the next
post and read that one.

What do you call someone that speaks three languages?  Trilingual. What do you call someone that speaks two languages?  Bilingual. What do you call someone that speaks one language?  American.

I don&#39;t see the point in prohibiting other languages. I just ignore it if I

Prejudice?  I&#39;d suggest that if you don&#39;t like the language used by the vast
majority of members of this group, you simply start your own group in
whatever tongue you prefer....just because some groups  allow multiple
languages is absolutely no reason this group should do so...since all the
instructions to this group are in English, I would think that any
prospective members with the slightest degree of intelligence would assume
it is an English speaking group.....of course, I could be wrong about that,
it just seems pretty obvious to me

There isn&#39;t necessarily a group anywhere in the world about mouthpiece
modifications AND with a primary language of French. I don&#39;t recall reading
any rule when I signed up here that I had to post in one language.

I read plenty of groups where people post in different languages. Generally
if there is someone who can read and translate, the question gets answered.
If not, the person presumably looks elsewhere.

I&#39;m glad to help, if I know the language. Otherwise, I just flip to the next
post and read that one.

next thing you know, they&#39;ll want to put bar codes on all the street signs

            <pre class='message__body'>a suggestion: if someone wishes to post, but lacks English skills,  
maybe one of you multi-lingual guys who has the time and the  
inclination could agree to have the post forwarded to them FIRST, they  
could translate to English and post it.....that way, there&#39;s no  
problem for anybody that I can see....using this system, nobody has to  
learn English, and the English speaking majority knows what is being  
said......looks like a win/win to me........

Jeff, thank you for the excellent translation.

Babelfish and other translation websites are terrible when it comes to translating musical terms, or any highly technical discussion.  For example, what we call a "tone hole" the French refer to as a "chimney".  

I hereby nominate Jeff to be our official mouthpiece French-Engish translator. Do I have a second?  ;-)
