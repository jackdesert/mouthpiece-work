            <pre class='message__body'>The easy way is to use epoxy plumber&#39;s putty--it starts about the consistency of wax when mixed. Grease or wax the inside of your mpc so that it doesn&#39;t stick, and mold it inside to the shape you want. Let it set slightly so that it is relatively hard and remove it gently to set the rest of the way. Then just glue it in place with contact cement. If it is too soft in the beginning you can wait until it gets a bit harder before beginning to shape and mold it.

I think most prefer to just put the epoxy right in there and let it set and
adhere, although Toby's method of forming the epoxy baffle and then cementing
it in is interesting.

I make removable baffles this way.  I have never used contact cement.  I
suppose it performs well as a temporary adheasive.  Sometime a removable
baffle will not wedge into place du to the shape of the sidewalls not being
tapered.  Here I have used a dab of poster hanging putty to hold them in
place.  Dental wax might work well too as a temporary adheasive.

I think Toby&#39;s idea of greasing the mouthpiece is sensible. I have
used a thin polythene underlay to prevent sticking after scratching a
good metal MPC, trying to remove the baffle. I also like using
Acrylic/Perspex/Lucite removeable baffles which can be wedged between
vertical sidewalls without glue. These require a lot of work with a
file though. Poster putty here is known as Blu-Tack or Stick&#39;n&#39;fix.

Plumbers Epoxy usually sets in 5 minutes.  That can be good and bad.  If
you get a good set of tools you can shape it after it gets hard.  Medium
coarse hand files.  A few riffler files (bent curved).  220 grit sand
paper.

I recently started using "Apoxy" putty.  There is a Link in the supplies
section on the site.  It is slower setting and they claim it is non-toxic. 
It comes in colors.  The black looks good in HR mouthpieces.  It hardens a
little soft to use to repair rails or tips.  It would be OK for tooth
gouges if a tooth patch is used over it.  Otherwise, JB weld is harder. 
But it is creamy, not a putty.

On many slow set epoxies, you can come back after 1-2 hours after they
partially harden.  You can then rework them with moist fingers and/or
shaping tools.  You can fuss with the shape to the point were no finishing
work is needed after they harden.
