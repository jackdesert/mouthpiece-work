I believe this to be true.  The reamed volume is probably so large that pushing it farther on the neck to correct it makes the high notes sharp and/or the low notes flat. 

I think you have also stated or implied that the insert was best located butted up against the sax neck end with not gap.  But was it also an acceptable correction (or similar to the unmodified Link) located farther away from the sax end?

Please excuse that I have not played around with inserts yet.  I do not have an easy way to make a precise one.  But I have played around with putty a lot.  I have not tried a putty "insert" near the neck end since it would be a litle messy to deal with.  I&#39;m also always working on a backlog of refacing work.

The discussion has gotten repeatative.  But I think it is OK to repeat the request for others to "try it".  I think there may be members here willing to test a passaround mouthpiece and insert.

            <pre class='message__body'>Pass Around - That&#39;s a good idea.

I used it as an extension of the neck opening.  Others tried it pushed away from the end of the neck, with interesting results.  In any case, it displaced chamber volume.

I got a little Unimate SL lathe, with the milling attachment a couple months ago, which I can&#39;t seem to separate myself from now.  I have 1-1/4" diameter brass rods here that I&#39;ve been machining conical tenons/receivers out of.  I envision, one day soon, putting a 6" long piece on and trying to get something mouthpiece shaped out of it.  Lots of fun.  They are common and not too expensive.
