            <pre class='message__body'>I just bought a pair of Depth guage dial micrometers .. fortunately
not for the $500 that they sell for .. one is 0-.040"  the other is
0-.250" about perfect for MPC work. These are "classic" i.e. old stock
- USA made

I will experiment with them for awhile but would like to sell them in
a few weeks  -- they are best used together as a team. I will upload
some pix when I get time.
