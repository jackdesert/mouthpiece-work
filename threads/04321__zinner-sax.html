            <pre class='message__body'>For hard rubber rough castings, try New York Hamburg.  They are the manufacturer of molded rubber blanks for most mouthpiece makers.  You will even see Vandoren mouthpieces on their homepage!  http://www.nyh.de/
   
  I believe Zinner purchases the rough blanks from them for most of their mouthpieces and then remanufactures them into finished mouthpieces at their factory in Germany.
   
  Good luck!
