            <pre class='message__body'>I searched through the archives and found a thread back in 2007 where  
an inquiry was made regarding black epoxy putty.  Folks on the list  
suggested Apoxie and PC-7.  In addition to these, I&#39;ve also used  
Milliput.  All of these epoxies have a pretty long cure time, which is  
not always optimal, so I&#39;m wondering if anyone has been able to find a  
jet black 5-minute epoxy.  I&#39;ve looked around a bit and haven&#39;t been  
able to locate anything.

Thanks in advance,

tends to make it grey, though.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have had some success (I need to qualify that I don&#39;t know the long-term ramifications) with putting a small amount of black paint into the JB weld.  It seems to have hardened sufficiently and is pretty black; although the color does lighten a bit upon sanding.  I think that it is a darker gray than without the paint.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have tried adding pigment (I purchased from Micro-Mark) to clear 5-min epoxy.  It seemed to cause it not to set up properly.  I have not tried it in fast set plumbers&#39; epoxy putty or JB Weld.  I think it might work better in the putty.
