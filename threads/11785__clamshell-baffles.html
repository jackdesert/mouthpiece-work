 IE.
 What are the benefits/drawbacks/effects of a clamshell baffle?
 

 Is a clamshell baffle something you can always choose to work into (add to) a mouthpiece, or is this type of baffle something that happens "automatically" as a result of other factors, such as a good baffle design meeting a more rounded ramp shape?
 

 Finally, I have little first hand experience with these, so the clamshell concept may be unclear to me. I mostly have seen these in photos only. So...
 In some cases I believe I can see a pronounced clamshell in the actual shape of the baffle (based on the reflection of light), whereas in other cases it may just be the shape of the file marks that haven't been polished away. Any clarification would be very helpful.

 

 Thanks everyone!
