            <pre class='message__body'>Hi - On our Cl BB [www.woodwind.org] we have discussed the colorations and  
smells of OLD hard rubber mps, so I suggest an archives Search there for much  
pertinent info.  The brown-greenish coloration appears to be only a surface  
?oxidation? which is removable, perhaps ?reversible?. The smell[s] may be  
diminished by a soaking in plain-colorless vinegar and "aeration" [out of case],  
and most of us old-clarinet buffs don&#39;t seem to mind it. So, if its name  
sounds good, don&#39;t throw it away. Luck, Don

            <pre class='message__body'>I soak mouthpieces in vinegar to remove white calcified saliva stains and crud in the chamber.
   
  To remove the brown-green oxidation I have found that a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and some water will do wonders.  It will leave the hard rubber dull, but it was dull when you started, right?  Then polish by hand with Kit Scratchout and a soft cloth (or use any other of many good plastic polishes) to bring it back to a nice shine.
