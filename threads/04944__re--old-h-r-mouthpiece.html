  To remove the brown-green oxidation I have found that a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and some water will do wonders.  It will leave the hard rubber dull, but it was dull when you started, right?  Then polish by hand with Kit Scratchout and a soft cloth (or use any other of many good plastic polishes) to bring it back to a nice shine.
