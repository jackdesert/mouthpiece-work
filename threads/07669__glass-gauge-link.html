I can get the Zip file and everything works except the printout of the film.

            <pre class='message__body'>You need to have the program "Corel Draw" on your system in order to open the file.  I just added a file "GlassGage.zip" to the Files section.  It is a Windows Meta File (WMF), and should be able to be opened by anyone.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thank you so much. Now everyone can have a BOX of gauges for $10 :D
My only concern is, when I opened it up, it ended up on Paint and well, is it exact size when it opens? I can&#39;t tell but it seems smaller than some of the ones I&#39;ve seen. Can you please clarify?
