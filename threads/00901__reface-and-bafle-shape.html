            <pre class='message__body'>I, tomheadly, (djonk/David K, by other ID&#39;s) was fortunate to win a 
free mouthpiece reface job, by Mr. MojoBari.  I wish to express here 
to all of the readers, that he did a superb job, for me.

He not only refaced my Johnson Selmer NY tenor mouthpiece, to a larger 
tip opening and a long facing, but he also blended a new baffle tip 
contour out of a botched up previous alteration.

Very neat work, Thanks Mojo.  BTW: the playing is the proof of a good 
job.  I like the way it plays for
