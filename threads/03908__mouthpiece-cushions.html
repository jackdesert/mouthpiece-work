            <pre class='message__body'>The mouthpiece surface should be clean, dry, and free of any oils (like 
fingerprints, even).  I have never had this problem, and I sometimes 
just wipe off the mouthpiece and slap a patch on (like if I need to put 
a patch on quickly at a gig for some reason).  They seem to stay on fine.

There is a thread on this newsgroup about materials for DIY mouthpiece 
cushions, although there was no single material that got everyone&#39;s 
vote.  For temporary patches on mouthpieces you&#39;re working on, certain 
types of tape work well.  Someone recommended a brand of (I believe) 
bandaging tape, and I have used the blue masking tape designed for 
painters (at Home Depot in the U.S.) cut and layered - it lasts long 
enough to play-test the mouthpiece, and almost long enough to play a gig 
on.  When it wears out and starts shredding little paper bits into your 
mouth, though, it&#39;s not fun...  I just had some around and tried it, 
it&#39;s not ideal or anything.

            <pre class='message__body'>Make sure you put them on a dry mouthpiece.

When I&#39;m testing mouthpieces I use electrical tape.  I&#39;ve never seen clear electrical tape but I suspect it exists.  I believe that you can purchase the material that Runyon uses for their clear patches from other sources and cut your own but that seems like a lot of work.  I also can&#39;t tell you where to get the 3M stuff.
