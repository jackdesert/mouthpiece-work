Steel is hard! I work with the table on a Bellite Beechler alto. Does it matter that the last (rear) 3.5 mm of the table is not flat? The rest is now flat and nice, but it is very much work to file down enough to make the last mm flate.

Hello
I guess he meant "sanding the reed" equally careful with that, because depending on how and where to do could cost ruin rather than improve. There is enough information on the Internet about the issue. Searches and searches until he finds.

I agree it&#39;s hard to get right. This is the thing that I see wrong with more
refaced and hand-finished pieces than anything else. If 3 or 5 mm toward the
back isn&#39;t flat, usually the whole thing isn&#39;t flat, it&#39;s bowed some. It&#39;s
all a matter of where you put the pressure when you sand it, and it&#39;s all a
