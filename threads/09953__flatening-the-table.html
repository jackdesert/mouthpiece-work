            <pre class='message__body'>Flatening the table is (for me) the hardest part of refacing a mouthpiece. 

Steel is hard! I work with the table on a Bellite Beechler alto. Does it matter that the last (rear) 3.5 mm of the table is not flat? The rest is now flat and nice, but it is very much work to file down enough to make the last mm flate.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sure it is hard and if you ask me the most difficult thing in refacing to
execute perfectly. Good flat table gives 20- 25% better mouthpiece overall,
all other things being equal. The stainless steel table flattening is the
ultimate test, get your technique razor sharp. Don&#39;t bother with those 3-4
mm. For the next time you may try to sand it shank first. Then you get the
end nice and flat plus you loose much less on the tip opening if it is an
issue and it is more often than not.

            <pre class='message__body'>It is a phrase " sand it shank first" instead of  " tip first" . Means hold
the mouthpiece shank first or opposite the way you are doing the sanding.

Hello
I guess he meant "sanding the reed" equally careful with that, because depending on how and where to do could cost ruin rather than improve. There is enough information on the Internet about the issue. Searches and searches until he finds.

            <pre class='message__body'> I agree it&#39;s hard to get right.  This is the thing that I see wrong with more refaced and hand-finished pieces than anything else.  If 3 or 5 mm toward the back isn&#39;t flat, usually the whole thing isn&#39;t flat, it&#39;s bowed some.  It&#39;s all a matter of where you put the pressure when you sand it, and it&#39;s all a matter of experience and feel.  Taking off a mm is a lot of work, even in rubber, I wouldn&#39;t even attempt to sand that much off steel.

I agree it&#39;s hard to get right. This is the thing that I see wrong with more
refaced and hand-finished pieces than anything else. If 3 or 5 mm toward the
