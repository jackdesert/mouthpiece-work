            <pre class='message__body'>Prof.Weinberg&#39;s statement "careful that the water is not too hot as it 
will start a chemical reaction in the ebonite (hard rubber) which will 
render the mouthpiece carcinogenic." has me a bit worried. I have seen 
many rubber mouthpieces that are brand new turn green just sitting in 
the display case. These have never been washed in hot water; some have 
never been washed at all. Are they carcinogenic ? What is the best way 
to deal with the "green sheen" ? I definitely don&#39;t want to knowingly 
introduce carcinogens to my customers&#39; oral cavities.

            <pre class='message__body'>sometime ago yanagisawa started to pack their ebonite mouthpieces in polythene : as they could not breath and started to &#39;sweat&#39; they turned green and smelt terrible. they soon stopped this. A glass case can
 have the same effect. this smell and taste--which is bitter--are the signs of carcinogenic properties and is dangerous.
the results --as documented in the Lancet medical journal many years ago are various throat and mouth cancers--although they do take time to appear as in all cancer.
