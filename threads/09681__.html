The architecture of the mouthpiece is partially based on the density of the 
material.  Weight vs. volume, if you pack the weight into a smaller volume with 
a denser material (metal), then the mouthpiece is smaller.  If you have a 
mouthpiece with no mass, it doesn&#39;t transfer sound as efficiently.

a lot of difference.....the rubber seems to "ring" a little  
more.....now before anybody starts with the "double blind scientific  
analysis" stuff, no, we don&#39;t do it that
way.....our experiments are for our own use, not general research for  
publication.....we&#39;re pretty satisfied we&#39;re on to something.....
