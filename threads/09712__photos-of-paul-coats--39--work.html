            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve just posted a few photos of some of my past and recent work.

First, a Conn Comet bari mouthpiece (manufactured for Conn by Runyon Products) with a cracked shank that I banded.  That was back in 2003.

Additional photos show two Comet baris I banded, one cracked shank, the other just preventative, last week.  I made the bands for those two on a Micromark 7x16 Minilathe I bought last summer. I&#39;ve had fun learning to use it, and I&#39;m still learning daily.

After that are photos of a bite plate replacement on a Brilhart Velvet Brass tenor sax mouthpiece that belonged to the late Boots Randolph.  In his later years he played Dukoff mouthpieces, but in the earlier days of his recording career he used the Velvet Brass on Yakety Sax, and recordings he did with Brenda Lee and others at that time.

I&#39;ll add other photos when I do anything more interesting than regular refacing.  I&#39;ll be adding photos of some chamber work on a Link in a few weeks.

In Photos, the folder name is Paul Coats Work.
