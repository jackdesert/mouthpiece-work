Please note the spelling! This is an obvious attempt to confuse buyers

description would try to imply that it is similar! This type deception  
speaks volumes about the seller!

Steve, now you&#39;re as famous as Selmar, Helmke and the like! I guess since my pads are &#39;not&#39; on the horn as well, I get to share some of the fame.
