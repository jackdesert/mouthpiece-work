Paul graciously visited my shop this past Thursday and gave a refacing
lesson to me and a couple of my students. I want to assure this group
that the man has some CONSIDERABLE skills!! Thanks, Paul. You &#39;da man!
 
BTW, I gave Paul a cold drip coffee making lesson (one of the few skills
I have) and I&#39;m pleased and honored to announce that Paul is now a
Unison Saxophone Endorsing Artist. We will have him up on our website
within a few days.
