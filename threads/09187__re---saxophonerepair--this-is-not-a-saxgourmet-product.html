            <pre class='message__body'>Orpheo was a brand name used by Orpheus Music, where I used to be  
involved. Orpheus closed (after I left) and became Noteworthy.  
Noteworthy was later acquired by Dennis Bamber, the person who founded  
and owned Woodwind/Brasswind prior to that companies bankruptcy.

All the Orpheo horns I had any involvement with are engraved "designed  
by Steve Goodson"....if the horn lacks this, I had nothing to do with  
it. All of the Orpheo horns I oversaw were manufactured by Tenon and  
have MusicMedic kangaroo pads.

If you have to mic a saxophone, the rest of the band is TOO LOUD!

            <pre class='message__body'>And some of us like the looks of the abalone Kasten.  It&#39;s a nice change of pace without copying the "semi-precious stone" look of the Cannonballs.  I own a large collection of Paua shell art (a form of abalone from new zealand) and I dug the abalone key touches the moment I saw them.  Everybody has a different perspective.  Part of what keeps life interesting.

just sayin&#39;
