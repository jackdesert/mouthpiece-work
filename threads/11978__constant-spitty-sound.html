            <pre class='message__body'>Hi All,
 

 I recently had a piece worked on, and now I'm experiencing a relentless spitty sound.. I've never had this issue with other mouthpieces, and I've tried many reeds. I've tried some that I know to be flat too, so I don't think reed warpage is the problem. When I pull the reed off after experiencing the problem, there seems to be a buildup of moisture directly behind the tip rail..
 

 Could there be a dead spot there in the air flow? Is this something anyone else has ever experienced? I measured and the facing curve is definitely even, there aren't any obvious flaws in the integrity of the tip or side rails, and the table is definitely flat. 
 

 Any feedback would be appreciated!

I had this spit sound problem in the past, especially with a high
baffle metal mouthpiece (Ponzol M1) with an added baffle insert. Did you
have the baffle raised? 

I&#39;ve always generated a great deal of saliva
while playing - to the point that the upper stack keys often get wet,
yuck. 

But I don&#39;t get much of that spitty sound on my current
mouthpiece (Selmer S80 C* with added baffle insert), so I think it&#39;s a
function of mouthpiece baffle shape. The Ponzol&#39;s high baffle ran all
the way to the tip rail, but that&#39;s not the case with the current setup,
where the baffle cuts away from the tip rail at a greater angle.

            <pre class='message__body'>Metal mouthpieces played in a cold environment cause excessive condensation inside which can cause problems of this type. If that is the problem, it usually gets better after you have played a while and the piece warms up.
