            <pre class='message__body'>Hi
I&#39;d like to talk to my students about baffles and chamber shape and have them add temp baffles to experience the difference in feel or sound
Can anyone reccomend a substance they&#39;ve had success with? Just want to have them squish something in there and hear a difference. Non toxic play doh or similar?
Cheers</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>I mostly use Blue Tac/Poster Hanging/Mounting Putty.  It is reusable and does not leave a residue in the mouthpiece.  But it does not stick well to a moist surfaces.  But most temporary putties prefer a dry surface.

Dental wax is easier to adhere and shape.  But soap and water is needed when you are done to clean out the waxy residue.  Play-Doh, clay, Silly Putty, all can be used.  

Shaping tools should be considered too.  Screw drivers can be used but might scratch the mouthpiece.  Popsicle sticks, glue mixing sticks. 

It is best if the mouthpiece is a classical low baffle mouthpiece or a Link-like mouthpiece so there is plenty of room to try some baffle and throats shapes.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use dental wax (GUM brand) based off of Keith&#39;s suggestion. These hold up really well. Available at any pharmacy. In fact, one of my "temporary" dental wax baffles has been in for over a year and has stood up to lots of playing, swabbing, etc. Easy to modify. Reusable. If it isn&#39;t for a client, there is really no need to replace it with a permanent baffle, IMO.

If for a client, then scrape out the dental wax with a Popsicle stick. The residue can be removed using a blow dryer or heat gun on low and a rag. I would wash with soap and water and dry before applying permanent material.
