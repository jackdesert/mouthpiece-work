If you have to mic a saxophone, the rest of the band is TOO LOUD!

            <pre class='message__body'>Is the problem remedied temporarily by sucking the spit out? If not, I think the roll over baffle may need adjusting. I find I get a spitty or "noisy" sound when I&#39;m refacing a piece and the roll over becomes too big/long. I believe the roll over controls the "buzz", not overall brightness, and you may be experiencing too much buzz. Reducing the wedge/step baffle as you did changed the chamber size and made the piece less bright, but didn&#39;t solve your problem. If you check out a good Link, the roll over baffle is very slight. My 2 cents.

John,
Regarding the spitty Selmer Classical metal model, I have heard stories of Jean-Marie Londeix coating his with thick olive oil before playing…   For myself I use variations of this same mouthpiece on alto.  I do have the flutted fifties classical model as well as the HR airflow short shank pre-soloist and the 1940’s (flat top) Metal Master.  The 1950s classical is indeed spitty, the others not.  These 3 mouthpieces all share similar baffle and chamber design with slight variations of sidewall rounding and throat diameters, the most significant difference between them is the angle of the ramp, on the 1950’s classical it is noticeably steeper.  I’d say 60 deg for the classical VS 25 to 30 deg for the Airflow and the Metal Master.  As a result the window on the Classical ends up being some 4-5 mm longer.  I added some clay to ramp of the Classical as to lower its angle to about 30% and the spittyness disappeared without affecting tone or intonation.  This is not a an elegant solution but i does seem to work at increasing the flow of air and pushing the condensation down the pipe so to speak.


Hope this helps,


MG

      When I was young I played classical saxophone.  Players such as Marcel Mule and Frederick Hemke used the selmer metal mouthpiece.  I remember there was a spit issue with this mouthpiece .  This was not a high baffle mouthpiece.  Today I use a Selmer metal E on Tenor.  This is a problem on some days.
