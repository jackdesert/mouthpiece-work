Is anyone familiar with sax mouthpiece blanks?  Just what makes
it a blank?  Int&#39;l Music Suppliers has some under the brand

            <pre class='message__body'>A blank is a body without facing.  The chamber is molded in.

Zinner is a German manufacturer that makes very fine blanks.  Their
clarinet blank is used by a number of small "manufacturers".

You can also purchase inexpensive mouthpieces for experimentation.  The
Madison/Winslow kit comes with one each clarinet, alto, tenor
mouthpieces.  These are Runyon Model 22&#39;s, student models.  These are
made by Runyon, stamped with their name, or the names of various
instrument manufacturers for inclusion with their new student
instruments.

Perhaps I can swing a deal on a quantity of these for use as "blanks" to
learn on?

There is no better way to learn the mouthpiece art than to start with a
known, playable mouthpiece, then modify it, play it, see what happens.
It will do one of two things, play better, or play worse.  But it is
good to have a standard, a starting point.

Again, the Zinners are excellent, well made blanks.

Thanks -- Do you know what the baffle looks like?  Is there enough 
there to shape a custom one, and enough material in the chamber to 
carve out chamber openings if one so chooses?

I have had good success with King stock mpc&#39;s on tenor.  They seem to 
be made of good rubber, with a Link-type baffle and sidewalls.  I 
have 2 of them, one that I worked on myself and one I sent to Jon Van 
Wie to see what really good craftsmanship looks like. :-)  I think 
these blanks were pretty old.  I don&#39;t know what the new ones are 
made from.   I used to work on plastic mouthpieces for 
experimentation, but the material is just too soft -- the top teeth 
leave a big gouge after a while.  H.Couf also made some good rubber 
pieces with really high baffles.

Are they rubber?  Or really good plastic?  I think I remember them 
being injection-molded.

Agreed.  I&#39;m interested in blanks to have a good starting point once 
I know what all the dimensions should be.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Zinner clarinet blank is the one I am most familiar with.  It is
pretty much a straight line baffle, classical type.  If you want a high
baffle you will need to use epoxy.

I have  King alto mouthpiece that is a Runyon 22.  I would have to look
at your Kink tenors to ID them.

The Runyon plastic is pretty tough.  It is actually a blend of acrylic
and synthetic rubber, engineered to vibrate the same as hard rubber.
The beak does not wear excessively from teeth, unless the player is a
real "Iron Jaw" type.  The Runyons are injection molded, but the facing
is machined, the baffle and tip are hand finished.

The Couf soprano piece is actually the Runyon Custom.  I think the other
Coufs are from another source.

I can probably get the Runyons for under $10 each.  Less if we leave off
caps and ligatures.  If clarinets, less if we leave off the cork, too,
and you cork it yourself.  So, if this is a good idea, I would need to
know how many to order... and clarinet, alto, or tenor.

the "Bundy Special Plastic" alto sax piece.  This is usually around $6.

Then I will see how many of each, total, and see what I can do from the
factory.  If we get them with less finish work, say, with no logos, just
a basic facing on there, we could probably do better as far as cost.

So, what do you think...ligature and cap, or just a mouthpiece?

            <pre class='message__body'>Since this is just for learning on, when I order, and it will be for
everyone at the same time, will be getting only alto blanks.

I think I can get to under $5 each, with a facing put on, no markings,
no lig, no cap.
