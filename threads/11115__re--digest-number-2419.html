            <pre class='message__body'>I went to my local auto parts store and bought a complete set of gauges.  Then using those liberal arts math skills...I combined them into the sizes I needed and taped them together (at the ends) .  That masking  tape is about 15 years old now.

It&#39;s my understanding that if you use a normal feeler gauge set for automotive use, the edges will be rounded for any feelers over about .007 inches, and this will give you inaccurate measurements.
Also I believe that automotive sets don&#39;t go beyond .032" generally. Both of these can cause significant problems in measuring and in refacing.

I have contacted Eastern Gage, and they said they could make a more complete set, but the cost is quite high to buy only one set. To get down to a reasonable price you would have to buy 10 sets or more.

I&#39;m considering doing this, but it would be a significant investment and headache. So I&#39;m wondering if anyone has already done this. I would be happy to help by buying one of their extra sets.

Please let me know if anyone has anything that might help me out.
Thanks!

As I inherited a dental spot welder from my Dad (used originally to weld 
orthodontic fixtures onto stainless steel bands) , I used it to combine 
automotive feeler gauges, and they measure out consistently using a 
digital caliper. That said, I have no idea where you could get this 
done; and probably not by your local dentist!

This is pretty important point, as it&#39;s the edge of the gauge that 
actually gives us the measurement.
Moreover it seems likely the radius of curvature or size of the chamfer 
might vary depending on the manufacturing method, and as noted above, 
depending on the thickness of the feeler gauge.
