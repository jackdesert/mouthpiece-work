            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys:  (Please sorry my poor English language) 
Relative to this topic, my opinion is the following, maybe some not be see in this way; but is
based on my own experience how player of sax and clarinet and how craftsman.

1) The saxophones aren&#39;t how a piano or a accordion, who have the notes now supply. Anyone, be that as it may, a eminent player or a bad performer, anyone can figering on those instruments and be sound it and in this instance the note will sound perfectly in tune, be this one well or bad in tune ;-) Such sound not depend of the player, but the instrument himself.

2) The saxophone depend for to sound correctly almost constantly of the player. If the sax are the better construted much best; the combination good instrument with good player is the ideal; but  have in view that the better saxophone in hands of a bad player can be listen totally horribly too is truth. 

3) I think that this topic treat of the perfection of such instrument; but be us honest, for what serve that
one phenomenal singer with a bad microphone in fron of his. and vice versa or to the contrary?

4) Small incorrect design or ending on the saxophones through of the time be solutionated or adjusted with the proper player isn&#39;t that so? How can us fix the proper deficiencies of a bad player when he play a better saxophone? Who can theorically tell us what is correct and what not like a clock of play a saxophone? Only a good player that know how compensate anyone bad node and antinode theorically calculate and situated can tell us such thing. Why? Because the good player who  too have your proper internal nodes and antinodes on your proper body, from the throat, bucal cavity and the lips that to envoy or send to the instrument and automatically adapt all there. The exercise to be the muscle. The good player and your  good saxophone it is the good sound in tune.

Sincerelly yours
