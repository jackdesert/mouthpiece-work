get my hands on, looking for the elusive Holy Grail. This week, I bought a
metal Yanigasawa metal, and although quite pricey, it struck me as far
superior to anything else I have tried. I&#39;m very happy with it. I notice
that instead of the customary round hole in the chamber stop plate, it has a
square hole. I can think of no reason for this. Any body know or have any
ideas?

Doesn&#39;t Selmer do that with some hard rubber models?
It&#39;s never made sense to me..end of neck receiver is
round;
outside of mouthpieces are round? Maybe something to
do with generating airflow turblance?

  I&#39;ve been using the &#39;nino piece that came in the Steve Goodson Model Sopranino case.  It needed refacing but that is not unusual.  Not too bad, just needed evening up a little.
   
  I didn&#39;t realize Yanagisawa made a metal nino piece.

            <pre class='message__body'>My friends at Sam Ash Music got me pretty much one of everything to try (all
at once!) and the Yani was the clear winner. I didn&#39;t know they made a metal
version until I opened the box.

Not the foggiest.
 
I&#39;ve been using the &#39;nino piece that came in the Steve Goodson Model
Sopranino case.  It needed refacing but that is not unusual.  Not too bad,
just needed evening up a little.
 
I didn&#39;t realize Yanagisawa made a metal nino piece.

  For the last couple of months I&#39;ve been trying every &#39;nino piece I could
get my hands on, looking for the elusive Holy Grail. This week, I bought a
metal Yanigasawa metal, and although quite pricey, it struck me as far
superior to anything else I have tried. I&#39;m very happy with it. I notice
that instead of the customary round hole in the chamber stop plate, it has a
square hole. I can think of no reason for this. Any body know or have any
ideas?
