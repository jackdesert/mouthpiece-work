            <pre class='message__body'>  For the last couple of months I&#39;ve been trying every &#39;nino piece I could
get my hands on, looking for the elusive Holy Grail. This week, I bought a
metal Yanigasawa metal, and although quite pricey, it struck me as far
superior to anything else I have tried. I&#39;m very happy with it. I notice
that instead of the customary round hole in the chamber stop plate, it has a
square hole. I can think of no reason for this. Any body know or have any
ideas?

            <pre class='message__body'>the new Selmer piece I tried had a round hole. I have no valid theory about
the square hole.....I do know the Yanigasawa piece is a fabulous player,
much better than the Selmer, Vandoren, rubber Yanigasawa, and various
Chinese pieces I tried.

Doesn&#39;t Selmer do that with some hard rubber models?
It&#39;s never made sense to me..end of neck receiver is
round;
outside of mouthpieces are round? Maybe something to
do with generating airflow turblance?
