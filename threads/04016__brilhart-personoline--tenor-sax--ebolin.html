The S5 measures 81/750 which is close and short when compared to
current mouthpiece standards.
As a clarinettist you may find it matches your embouchure ok but if
already using a more open lay on tenor, you will find it restrictive
--- unless classical playing is your forte.
I think you have answered your own question regarding the scraping
behind the tip. I have only seen an alto Personaline MPC & if my
memory serves me correctly, it had a roll over baffle behind the tip.
It looks like an owner mod to reduce brightness, particularly on high
notes. EDDIE
