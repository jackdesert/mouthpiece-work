            <pre class='message__body'>I have inherited it from another horn, I&#39;m mainly a clarinet  player. This 
good looking, unscarred, [older?] tenor mp, its  markings looks like S 5 
[facing?], 91080 [ser.#?], and it has a  smoothly, scraped-out area of about 10 mm in 
length, tapering to the  very thin tip "flat".  This seems unusual to me, SO, 
is it  "as-manufactured" or "owner-improved" ?  What might I expect to find 
in  playing on it, I will be able to do so before long.  Will appreciate  all

The S5 measures 81/750 which is close and short when compared to
current mouthpiece standards.
As a clarinettist you may find it matches your embouchure ok but if
already using a more open lay on tenor, you will find it restrictive
--- unless classical playing is your forte.
I think you have answered your own question regarding the scraping
behind the tip. I have only seen an alto Personaline MPC & if my
memory serves me correctly, it had a roll over baffle behind the tip.
It looks like an owner mod to reduce brightness, particularly on high
notes. EDDIE
