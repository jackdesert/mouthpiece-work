I think the facing interacts with the player&#39;s embouchure to create some
intonation control issues.  This is especially true of very wide tip
openings.  If a player does not quite have the chops for it, they try to
compensate for the wide tip by biting the piece closed some.  Then minor
changes in embouchure makes the pitch go wild.

See if the note sounded is the same. If it is different you are looking at different internal volumes, which will affect the intonation. If it is the same then Keith&#39;s explanation is probably what is going on.

Variable shank length is a big factor.  But even if you subtract the amount

I have found that smaller volume sop sax MPs play better for me on my

Slightly larger, the squeeze chamber ones are good for me too (Bari,

What makes a mouthpiece have squirly intonation.  Ive one that Is 
generally in range but when I go for the right hand octave D or E it 
goes quite sharp.  I have other moutpieces that this does not occur 
with so I cant blame the horn.  Is it in the facing or chamber...what 
might be able to be done?  Ive addressed biting and its not that either.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sigmund, generally, when a mouthpiece goes quite sharp
in the palm keys, and they open a normal amount, it is
due to the chamber size being improper for the bore
and neck of that sax.

The low register and upper register have quite a
different node/antinode patter going on.  

The low register tunes by mouthpiece volume.  The
volume in the chamber (which is really everything past
the end of the neck cork), to be in tune with a
properly designed sax, should be equal to the missing
conical section of the neck.  It is easy to see that
if the chamber is "small", the mouthpiece will have to
be pulled out to achieve the correct volume.  If the
chamber is "large" the mouthpiece will have to be
pushed in more to achieve the correct volume.

So, with a large chamber mouthpiece, the mouthpiece is
pushed in quite far.  This is why old mouthpieces from
the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s are often "short shank".  They have
that huge, round cavernous chamber, and have to be
pushed on quite far on the neck cork.  Some would even
hit the neck octave pip if not for the short shank.

BUT!!!  The upper register tunes by LENGTH of the
mouthpiece past the end of the neck.  The large
chamber mouthpiece is too short for some saxes, and
the upper register, the palm keys, are sharp.

You can also run into the opposite problem.  A very
small chamber "peashooter" chamber.  These mouthpieces
usually have a very long shank in order to have
stability on the neck cork.  And many times, they will
be flat in the palm keys even if the rest of the range
plays in tune fairly well.  The player will try to
"bite" the pitch up into tune, and the high notes will
choke off.

So, in your case, your mouthpiece chamber is too large
for your instrument.

            <pre class='message__body'>Most saxes tend to be sharp on D2 when you get the rest of the sax mostly
centered up.  It has to do with compromises in bore taper and using two
octave key pip locations for the entire 2nd octave as opposed to an optimal
one for each note (which would be a mechanical nightmare).  So the ends of
each pip range have the most problems.  D2, A2/G2, C#3 (especially on
sops).  C#2 is often a little flat making the break across to D2 an even
larger step than desired.  Some saxes are better than others.

We all use some muscle memory to favore these out-of-tune notes.  When you
switch mouthpieces/reeds, the differences can make you muscle memory
somewhat obsolete.  This is most noticable with tip opening changes.  Now a
little embouchure adjustment might make a larger/smaller difference than
what you were expecting.

It may be possible to make this better/worse with mouthpiece chamber volume
changes.  But I can not predict which way to go.
