            <pre class='message__body'>I just bought two digital gauges from member David Kulcinski.  These 
are used, but good working gauges.  These are the "Logic Basic 
Series" made by CDI Chicago.  

The gauges can be set for mm&#39;s or inches.

They fit perfectly in the fixtures I got from Steve Fowler and my 
original Winslow tip gauge.

The neat thing... with the needle type gauges, I had to count 
backwards to determine the tip opening as the probe dropped below the 
zero (which was the plane of the mouthpiece table).  

With these digital gauges I can place the gauge/fixture on my glass 
work surface, zero the gauge.  Then place on the mouthpiece and read 
the tip opening as, for example, -.098".  No counting back, no 
subtraction, just a direct reading.

I&#39;ll let David post purchase details.  

I liked the first one so much I bought a second one.

            <pre class='message__body'>There is a 2nd function that reverses the measurement direction.  This will give all positive indications.

I have 12 gauges that I would be happy to sell to the first 12 respondents.  They are used, but are in working order.  The cost is $25.00 + $5.00 S&H  + insurance to the USA.  Overseas postage will be determined upon furnishing mailing address information.  They are warranted for 30 days.  If, for any reason, you are not satisfied, return gauge postage paid for a full refund minus S&H.

There is a picture of a typical gauge in the photos section in the "Digital Gauge" album.

Thank you,

David

this is Gian and this is my new contact on MouthpieceWork Group.
don&#39;t write me anymore on cubismofree@..., is no more active
from yesterday.

The price for shipping you post for Argentina seems the same for
Europe. Due to the low price of the gauge, sure the shipping as
Priority and not Express is good for me resident in Italy.

So, just tell me how to pay and total due. When do you think you will
ship the gauge? I&#39;m ready to pay using paypal. Do you have?

Thanks to let me know.
Grazie e ciao.
Gian
