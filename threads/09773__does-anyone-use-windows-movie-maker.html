            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

It&#39;s not related to this group (sorry) but I  wanted to see if anyone
uses Windows Movie Maker on Vista.

I am just having trouble exporting the work.  I splices some video together and it looks great in the program, but comes out all distorted when I "published" it to the computer and it plays on Windows media player.  It has big green stripes like UPC labels on the top half of the screen.

When importing the original video it was in AVI format.  Its a long file to import (1 hour), but the end result was 3 minutes.  

Am I importing the video at too high of a quality?  Should it be in MPEG format?  Is 1150 kbps, 720x480 too high to work with?

Thanks for help anyone can be,

Lori T

someone wants to reply, please do it privately via Email.
