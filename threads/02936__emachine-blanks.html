After a suitable waiting period to create some demand, I can work on
another design/order.

  I&#39;ve got one that I think is playing pretty nicely now after considerable fussing with the chamber.  I cut the beak down to a rather radical "duckbill" and was happy with the result. I was wondering what sort of facing schedule anyone has found to work nicely on these. This has been a FUN project, and I was wondering if and when List-meister Bradbury was going to order some more blanks for the group?

            <pre class='message__body'>The design program is tough to work with on baffle shapes.  It currently
only allows baffles that are parallel to the bore of the mouthpiece.  So it
needs to be high enough to meet the tip rail.

On way around this is to make a staircase steps tha can be easily file
blended together.  Also, eMachine Shop may develop the program more in the
future.
