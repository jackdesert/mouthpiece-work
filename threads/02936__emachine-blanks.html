            <pre class='message__body'>I just sold out of the extra blanks I had and just broke even in doing so.

After a suitable waiting period to create some demand, I can work on
another design/order.

            <pre class='message__body'>The design program is tough to work with on baffle shapes.  It currently
only allows baffles that are parallel to the bore of the mouthpiece.  So it
needs to be high enough to meet the tip rail.

On way around this is to make a staircase steps tha can be easily file
blended together.  Also, eMachine Shop may develop the program more in the
future.
