 Im a rookie when it comes to mouthpiece refacing
 

 I have a bit of dilemma here. I hope you can help me with this one
 

 I have a set of 26 feeler gauges here and the thickest blade on it is just up to 63" or so. I found that some mouthpieces require more than 63" feeler gauge and I'm thinking of buying 2 sets of feeler gauges and going to stack those feeler gauges (and measure it using a caliper) to reach the required gauges for a particular mouthpiece.
 

 Did anyone here at least attempted to try that kind of stuff? 
 

 

 Thank you

Over time, I would measure the stacks again and some of them changed more than I liked.  So I ended up seeking out the larger feeler sizes.

 So you do that also..For now that's the thing I would do since I'm on a tight budget. I heard about theo wanne's feeler gauge set and I'm planning to buy that if I have enough money.

Make sure they are clean, bind them with scotch tape on the ends and test with a micrometer when done,

Good day everyone

 

Im a rookie when it comes to mouthpiece refacing

 

I have a bit of dilemma here. I hope you can help me with this one

 

I have a set of 26 feeler gauges here and the thickest blade on it is just up to 63" or so. I found that some mouthpieces require more than 63" feeler gauge and I&#39;m thinking of buying 2 sets of feeler gauges and going to stack those feeler gauges (and measure it using a caliper) to reach the required gauges for a particular mouthpiece.

 

Did anyone here at least attempted to try that kind of stuff? 

 

 

Thank you

            <pre class='message__body'>26 is like 3-4 times more than you need for that range (I use 12 from .0015 to .125) but yeah, you can stack them for larger sizes, i did that until I realized I wanted more accuracy than was possible. 1 big pitfall -- parallelism between the leading edge and the x-y plane. i.e., when you stick them together, it's hard not to have one side taller than the other. If you use an even amount of a thin adhesive and clamp them together evenly you'll give yourself the best shot at it. 

 Why I don't think more feeler gauges -> more accurate work: there's only so accurately you can work on the facing in the first place. If you're going freehand with wet/dry on a surface plate like most of us are, the softness of the paper and the depth of the grit compared to the curvature of the facing mean that there is only so small an area that is even possible to work, regardless of the skill of the hand pushing the mouthpiece. Measuring a resolution much smaller than that is a waste of time.
