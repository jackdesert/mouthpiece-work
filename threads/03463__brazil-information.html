            <pre class='message__body'>There are many pictures of mouthpieces being refaced on the Mouthpiece 
Work website.  Also, Patrick Springer had some pictures on his website 
of mouthpiece tables being flattened.  I don&#39;t remember where they were 
located, but:

http://www.springermpc.com/

There is a lot of information about refacing in the archives (the old 
messages) on the Mouthpiece Work site as well, but it is all in 
English.  Maybe the pictures would be more helpful.

            <pre class='message__body'>We do not have any CAD drawings posted that would assist you in making 
a mouthpiece.  Some of them members may have some, but I doubt it.

There are many mouthpiece designs, so starting with someone else&#39;s CAD 
design seems strange to me.  A more normal approach would be to get a 
mouthpiece you like and try to copy it.  You should create your own 
drawings of this mouthpiece if you need them.  Or take it to a designer 
or shop that can do this for you.

I have not.  Micro-Mark sells supplies for this.  Shrinkage is a small 
issue from what I&#39;ve read.
