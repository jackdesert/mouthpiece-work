            <pre class='message__body'>Hi to all the friends of the blog,

I recently found an old Larsen 100/0/SMS with very long table and
window. I had many and different BL offset but the table so long make
me curious. Age &#39;50 o &#39;60 ???
I take sizes and I found it have shorter facing than SMS, only a 20
mm., and even the baffle is lower than usual /O. and tip opening 115.
Facing is anyway not pair, I got problem on high notes and whistle.

How to fix the facing and the considering mpc is in stainless and I
have poor tools, good for HR or brass? How to down the table to close
the tip  of 010, as make it a 106 ?

Thanks.
Gian

            <pre class='message__body'>DEAR JOHN,

If you are looking for practice in refacing try a cheaper rubber piece first.
WOW THAT&#39;S A GREAT IDEA..! BUT UNFORTUNATELY I&#39;M NOT INTERESTED TO PRACTICE, WHY DO YOU THINK I&#39;M? MY MAIN INTEREST IS TO KNOW THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE, AND HOW DIFFERENT  TECHNICIAN CAN DO THE WORK.

 Having done one stainless steel mpce, I would suggest sending it to a pro, especially if you don&#39;t have the tools. 
I&#39;VE TRADITIONAL TOOLS BUT NOT FOR STEEL AND I&#39;VE NOT A REFACING MACHINE AS RUNYON OR LARSEN HAVE, AND I DON&#39;T THINK A DREMEL WILL BE GOOD ON A RAIL!! THAT&#39;S IT. 

 It is very difficult to work with otherwise.  
OBVIOUSLY JOHN... 
BUT I&#39;M NOT INTERESTED TO REBUILD OR TOTALLY CHANGE A STEEL MOUTHPIECE.  

JUST INFORMATIONS GIVE ME KNOWLEDGE AND THAT&#39;S WHAT I NEED.
 SURE "MOJO" OR SOMEONE ELSE CAN DO IT BETTER THAN ME, BUT THAT&#39;S NOT MY QUESTION.

QUESTION ARE:
LONG TABLE... YEAR OF PRODUCTION ?
FACING WITH CURVE STARTING AT 22, BUT SMS IS NOT 24? 
CAN HAPPEN ON LARSEN? THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENCES ON LARSEN!
AND FINALLY... HOW TO WORK ON STEEL?

G/L

            <pre class='message__body'>When working on stainless steel, you can use the same files you use on brass, but they will dull after 1-3 jobs.  If they are low cost Asian-made files, you may just want to buy more.  I use Valtitan files which are very hard and cost a little more.  These will last for 10-30 SS jobs.

For chamber work use a high speed rotary tool with grinding points.  

For table and facing work, I start with coarser grades of sandpaper.  120 grit when opening/closing a tip.  220-320 for most other work.  Expect the paper to get dull quickly.

Many Bergs have convex tables.  I think you may need to practice on 10-20 mouthpieces before you are good at flattening a convex table.  So I would recommend that you practise on non-SS mpouthpieces until you are good at it.  Otherwise, you can try to make the Berg table concave first, then try to flatten it.  Flattening a concave table is easier than flattening a convex one.

            <pre class='message__body'>This Berg Larsen is a very rare and valuable mouthpiece from the 1940&#39;s 
and would remain more valuable if it is left alone. You are risking 
ruin of an item valued within a $250 to $400 range.  Condident 
technicians that have done hundreds of sucessful refacing jobs should 
only attempt altering a gem such as this one.
