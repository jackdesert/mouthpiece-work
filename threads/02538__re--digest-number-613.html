            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

Although I&#39;m not an expert in dental materials and don&#39;t follow the 
purely scientific journals in regards to the latest research, I have not 
seen anything in the general dental literature regarding health problems 
associated with the intraoral use of approved resins and epoxies which 
have been prepared and used properly.  In fact, the use of bonded 
materials, which have been available since the 50&#39;s (although vastly 
inferior to the materials currently available), received their greatest 
boost in popularity due to the concern (unfounded in my opinion) over 
the health risks posed by the use of silver filling material.  However, 
having typed that, I will contact a couple of materials "experts" and 
find out what the laboratory scientists are saying on this subject, if 
anything.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I have seen articles which express concern over the use of dental expoxies and sealers in that they contain Bisphenol A, which is an endocrine disrupter. These are mostly from ecology- and health-oriented organizations, which stress that extremely minimal exposure to xeroestrogens at certain critical periods result in rather catastrophic effects (especially to pre-pubertal males), such as increases in testicular cancers, genital malformations (in utero exposure) and lowered sperm counts, etc.

Industy counters that such effects have not been demonstrated scientifically at the typically small exposures that one receives from dental applications, and that the Bisphenol A leaches out rather quickly. There is really no conclusive evidence one way or another, according to my reading.

There is plenty on the internet, if people are interested I can dig up some links.
