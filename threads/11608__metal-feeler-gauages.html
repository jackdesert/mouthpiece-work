            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Hi Keith-

  

I have been lurking on the mouthpiece work list for a number of years, reading
all posts with intention to start but never taking the first step.

  

I'm looking to start the mouthpiece journey and would like your advice on how
to set up my workspace and purchase the necessary tools.

  

I am interested in the feeler gauges you recommended as well as the reed sets
and the sanding tools. Would you take a moment to recommend any additional
tools, in particular the glass gauge?

  

Also do you take paypal?

  

many thanks in advance,

  

Dan Zupan
