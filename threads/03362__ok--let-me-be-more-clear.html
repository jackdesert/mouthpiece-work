            <pre class='message__body'>What I have avaliable is some one who can either cut (in metal) a place 
where I will pour resin of some unknown name or he can cut a groove and 
he will make a corresponding mold where I could pour some (again 
unknown) material to make a plate to be inserted once hardened...ie 
Link type system.

In such a position which would be easier ( I think the first method ) 
and now back to my earlier question...what do you pour in there?  I 
looked up Surfcoat...it doesnt seem right...it states its clear and its 
properties sound as though they are thin, not paste like.  I shot an 
email to Phil to see if he would elaborate.  Otherwise Im open to 
suggestions...ideas

thanks
