            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I've always just swabbed out my saxes after a gig, dried out the neck (as best
as I can) and the mouthpiece, and let the reed dry a little before putting it
back into storage. While on the road, I'd open up the case in the hotel room
so everything could finish drying out. My pads stayed in remarkably good shape
for long periods of time, even during strings of many-nights-a-week of long
hard-blowing gigs. Stuff didn't get a chance to grow, so no actual cleaning-
off-gunk was needed.  
  
My repairman thought I had some secret to keeping the pads in good shape, but
it was just letting them dry off as much as possible every time I used the
horn.
