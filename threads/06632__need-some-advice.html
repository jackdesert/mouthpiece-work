            <pre class='message__body'>Guys Ive got a guardala thats not so reed friendly. MB2 from WWBW. 
Played for about 13 years(5 as a "pro"). At first I thought it was 
because of me coming from a Otto Link NY 7(check out 
www.myspace.com/jazzsax1906 if u want to hear how it sounds). Can 
someone explain why this happens so much cause Ive been told that alot 
of guardala&#39;s mouthpieces are like that and a possible solution/repair 
man? Thx

            <pre class='message__body'>The Guardala LTs are very good CNC-made mouthpieces.  I would consider them reed-friendly.  Most are a little resistent in low note response IMO, even though they have long facing curves.  This can be helped with a facing curve adjustment or a reed adjustment.  The altissimo response can be improved too.  This reqieres an adjustment in the tip rail area.  But these mouthpiece play fine for most players right out of the box.  
 
I have seen a little more variation in the WW&BW MB2s than the other LTs.  They came out later and may have different programming and shop issues.  The facing curve shape is a little wavy.  This adds some resistance to the response in general.
 
I usually charge 1/2 a reface fee to work on DGs.  They are a joy to work on since they have so much going on that is right.

Usually when that happens the cause is a crooked facing.  You have to 
find a reed that is cut in such a way that it happens to work with 
the crooked facing. 

The table may not be flat. 

Or there may be a "kink" in the facing curve, a spot where the curve 
is too much, not blending well with the rest of the curve.

And sometimes the facing is good, but due to the shape of the baffle, 
the mouthpiece is very finicky about which reeds play with it and 
which don&#39;t.  This is more difficult to diagnose.  It is something 
you can&#39;t easily measure and predict from measurements as you would a 
facing curve.
