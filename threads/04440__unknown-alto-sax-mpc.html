            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all.
I have in my collection of stuff an alto sax mouthpiece I have not 
been able to find out anything about.  Your help woulod be appreciated.

It is a hard rubber piece, with a fluted body, slim design, (similar 
OD size to a metal mpc)with a nickel silver shank and bore (up to the 
chamber.)  The markings are: BHB Excelsior Super True Lay, and on the 
side at the base of the facing, 3.0.

Thanks in advance,
Geoff Secomb.
