            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Guardala's partner is named Jeff Powell, and you can reach him via the
alt.music.saxophone newsgroup, where he goes by the handle abbedd. I wouldn't
necessarily believe everything he says, though. Look at some of his earlier
posts and make your own decision about his reliability.
