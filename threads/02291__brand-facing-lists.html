            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone have the old Erik Brand manual with the complete list of 
measured pieces.  The Ralph Morgan manual I believe has the same 
information.  My EB manual is the newer one and doesn&#39;t have any 
measurements.

Specifically I am looking for Kaspar (Frank not Frank L.) clarinet 
measurements such as the Kaspar 11 and 13 as well as contra-alto and 
contra-bass measurements for comparison to generated curves.

I am presently doing a major repair to a Selmer C** contra alto piece.
