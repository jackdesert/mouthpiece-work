            <pre class='message__body'>I use a swiss army knife and I sharpen it often.  I am a scraper and  
use a large and small Swiss Army Knife.  No power tools for me.   I  
open the facing first and then the scraping begins.  I thin the rails  
and widen the window and reshape the baffle.

I finish it with many, many popsicle sticks and sandpaper.   I bend  
and twist and carve the popsicle sticks.  I also eat the popsicle.  I  
made a jig to hold the mpcs.

So I guess my answer is no.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a lot of pressure, so popsicle sticks would break.  

i finish the shaping/polishing with strips of thick leather glued to the files and various grades of rock cutting/polishing grit, in an oily goo.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes.  Nevermind the reamer, you don&#39;t need that kind of accuracy, just drill.  Hold it in a vise, a V on the moveable jaw and an angled insert the exact angle of the table w/r/t the bore against the fixed jaw.  I&#39;ll post a photo of my setup for this later.

This is no help for a large chamber, though.  You could use a boring bar for a little ways but it won&#39;t be long before you get to where the floor hits the bore.  Past there, you need CNC to do it mechanically.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve put a couple of photos up in a "workholding" folder.  pardon the chips everywhere.  One is of a mouthpiece held like I suggested, the V is ground into the moveable jaw on the toolmaker&#39;s vise.  The other shows the angle plate, it has a knob that sits in the window as a stop.
