            <pre class='message__body'>I recently picked up an older Brilhart Level-Aire mouthpiece(my first 
LA)and although I like it I find the height of the odd bite plate to be 
uncomfortable for me. What I&#39;d like to do is sand it down to more of a 
wedge shape(thinner at the tip)Would this adversely effect the piece or 
should it still play fine? Also, what would be the recommended method I 
use to accomplish this? 
Thank you
Alan

            <pre class='message__body'>You should be able to reshape it with medium coarse files and sandpaper. 
It will not effect the sound other than  from your embouchure being a
little more closed.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve done just what you describe on those pieces. It doesn&#39;t hurt the piece but it may hurt the resale value.  I  used a file to shape the bite plate so it&#39;s thinner at the tip and gave it more of  a rounded top.  I&#39;ve even built up the back with epoxy putty in some cases to  get the exact shape I like -- then put  on a stick-on tooth guard.
