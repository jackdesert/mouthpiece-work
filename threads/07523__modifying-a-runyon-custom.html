I get a runyon custom tenor mpc who is really to "agrssif" and "metalic" for me. Can perhaps someone say me if I can file a bit the baffle at a specific place to get it more mellow ? If so, can you specify the distance from the tip to help me to locate the place better ? 
Or should I send it to a refacer to let correct it (rails, table, baffle, chamber etc...) ?
Thanks to all

The place to file would be immediately behind the tip rail, filing off the "rollover" and then blending from the straight part of the baffle into the tip.  This requires some skill.  I&#39;ve done it on many Selmer S80&#39;s.

I&#39;m also well familiar with the Runyon Customs, and have played them for years.  The tone is quite good, and you may be hearing some high frequency vibration through your teeth. Try recording yourself and see if you really sound as bright as you think you do.
