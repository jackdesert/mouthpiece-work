            <pre class='message__body'>The following is the best I&#39;m able to group all the tools and 
supplies discussed to date, using Keith&#39;s suggested categories.  This 
information is followed by what I have decided to start with as my 
basic MPC kit, to begin measuring and refacing with.  This 
information has been heavily influenced by Paul and Keith, as well as 
others, all of whom I am very grateful to for your suggestions and 
advice.

Any misinterpretations or misunderstandings are solely the delight of 
my own inner child.  A comment, I think I remember, from Phil, about 
chamber or bore work fascinates the dark side of me but I&#39;m jumping 
in deep enough, for the moment, with just measuring and simple 
refacing work for the moment.  Any additional comments or feedback 
will continue to be appreciated.  And, please excuse me for eating up 
so much bandwidth with a couple iterations of sorting though all this 
but, with all due apologies, I&#39;m not altogether very mechanically 
oriented, so to speak.

You probably meant .0015, .002 for the "thin ones".

My odd-ball set of feelers came from looking over the spacings of feelers
in use and I put them in a spreadsheet.  Some of the conventional spacings
are really strange.  Winslows looks pretty good, but why go from .024 to
.031 then .048?   .031 is too close to .024.

So I came up with a set of target feelers.  After I got them together, I
measured them with my calipers in several spots on the edge that would be
used on the glass gage and wrote the thickness on them.  That is why I have
a .0095 instead of a .010.  A .0005" error is not a big deal, I just wanted
to know what I really had.  For the larger sizes, I taped several of the
smaller feelers together.  I do not recommend this but I do not have an
alternative inexpensive source for the sizes I need.  

I periodically remeasure the thickness of my feelers and get different
results by as much as .0015" on the taped up ones.  I just live with the
variation.

As Paul relayed from Winslow, the .0015" feeler could be .002".  This would
give about a 1 number lower reading (.5 mm) on the glass gage based on a
Tenor sax facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think the reason for the .031� gauge is that it is close to one of the
gauges in the old E. Brand kit.  Also, the .048� is close to the .050�
in the E. Brand kit.

The spread of sizes in the E. Brand is OK, but talking to John Winslow,
he felt adding the .014� gave an additional measurement in that critical
area of the break.

            <pre class='message__body'>Winslow&#39;s logic to add the .014" is good.  But using .031" seems like a
poor choice as compared to .034".  It looks like he just really likes to
cluster readings around the "break" area.  I think better facings can be
made by spacing the readings out as I do.  But it is more work.  Perhaps
even overkill.  But I would rather err on the conservative side.

            <pre class='message__body'>He says along that break area is more critical.

And the sizes he uses translate to mm sizes.  I will read them off when
I get home.
