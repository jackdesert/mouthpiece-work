            <pre class='message__body'>Wolf Tannenbaum, AKA Wolf Tayne, passed away today at age 95.....he was active in refacing mouthpieces until very recently. Wolf had studied with Santy Runyon, and often amused me with stories of Santy (who I studied with) and Santy&#39;s many girlfriends and other escapades.....I used to see Wolf regularly at trade shows, and he and I continued to stay in touch throughout the years. I last spoke with him a couple of months ago. I got several mouthpiece facing lessons from him, and a lot of laughs....a great guy....rest well, my friend</pre>
