Here is a link.  Some shorter link might work too.

No.  It is very fine "0000" steel wool.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith for your nice movie and good advices.
I would like to have a better glass gauge as the one you showed in the 
pictures. Where I can find one Erick Brand like glass gauge? Moreover, 
here in europe it is very difficult to find non-metric feeler gauges. 
Where can I buy the standard Erick Brand set of feeler gauges by using 
paypal in USA?
Thanks in advance for the answers,

Dan

more extensive information in the files area.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes thanks,
I saw the list in the file area and I tried to order a professional 
glass gauge from one company in US. They answered me through their 
local representative and if the values you reported are true (I have no 
doubts) the price increased more than 3 times.... from 20$ to 60 Euros 
+ shipping. If someone wants to help me I can pay 40$ + shipping for 
that glass gauge :)

            <pre class='message__body'>That price does seem high.  Has anyone purchased a Glass Guage from Babbitt
recently?

            <pre class='message__body'>I was about to call them today and order a couple - I&#39;ll let you know 
what they say.

Meanwhile, I&#39;ve downloaded one of the files with 1/2-mm markings, to be 
printed on clear labels (I think) and applied to plain glass (like 
microscope slides).  I&#39;ll read the instructions and see if I can make 
this low-cost solution work.  Any first-hand info or opinions on these 
home-made glass gauges?

            <pre class='message__body'>Dan,
I recently broke my last glass gage so I&#39;ve been trying to make a 
homemade one. I&#39;m having trouble getting consistant readings probably 
because the pieces of glass I&#39;ve tried are not perfectly flat. I&#39;m 
going to keep trying and will let you know if I have any success.

If the right type of glass can be found, it seems to me that a homemade 
glass can be as good or better than the Morgan or Babbit gages.

> >Pro glass gauges are not available here in Scotland and transparent
labels are expensive, so I made my gauge from picture glass (free
cuttings  from a framer) with a 1mm scale from a clear Helix acrylic
ruler. The scale with its sloping edge is cut away from the ruler.
From this, two scales are cut to fit the glass size, 35x70mm in my
case, with their thin edges and markings, lined up, face to face down
the centre of the glass.
These are glued along the outer edges with medium or thick
cyano-acrylate (ZAP), taking care not to allow the glue to migrate on
to the scale area. A little care has to be taken in its use and the 1mm 
segments have to be transposed into real measurements, but it has
proved perfectly adequate for an amateur refacer.             Eddie
