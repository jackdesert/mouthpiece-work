I would like to add to the comments about Tom Ridenour.

I studied with Kal Opperman for many years on the late 1960&#39;s. 

I learned how to play the clarinet well, make mouthpieces and reeds, and a
lot about the mechanics of the clarinet from him. 

Richard Stoltzman was a student with Kal at the same time.

 

In the 1970&#39;s, I can&#39;t remember exactly when, I started Tom off on his
journey into the clarinet world. 

He wanted to learn how to make reeds and said "but I am not a carpenter". 

Tom had a bright, probing mind and found ways to achieve results from
different perspectives than the other students. 

I would show him a way, but he would come up with a different way that
suited him better.

He is still doing that today - making clever solutions to unusual clarinet
problems.

He is also a fine clarinet player, so this reinforces the veracity of his
ideas.

I highly recommend listening to Tom&#39;s ideas, thoughts and tips, and give
them a try.

 

The reason for this comment is that if you are a serious player, there is
another thing a reed must do - #5, Respond. 

There are many great sounding reeds that have all four qualities below but
won&#39;t start a pianissimo note easily. 

That kind of reed I wouldn&#39;t want to use at an important performance.

 

As for a Opperman reed only lasting 6 months, I am still playing on some of
my reeds that have 1970s and 1980s dates on the back.

The single reed community has a lot to learn about maintaining great reeds.

With Tom&#39;s kit, you are not just paying for the simple tools and video.  You
are 
paying, in part, for the knowledge he imparts to you, and the method he
teaches 
you on the video.

An aside, I know Tom, have talked to him face to face, via email, many
times.

What Tom does is test for the four things a reed must do.  A reed must:

(1) Play high notes,

(2) Play low notes, 

If it can do that, it can do the notes in between.

(3) Play loudly, and finally, 

(4) Play softly.

If it can do that, it can do the volume levels in between.

That&#39;s all the reed must do.  He teaches you specific playing tests to test
for 
those things, and teaches you how to correct them.

Yes, side to side balance is part of that.  He teaches you how to play and 
test for that, and how to correct.

The sanding method he teaches is so simple he does not even have to look 
at the reed in order to do it.  I have seen him correct a reed while looking

me in the eye telling me how to do it.
