            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I joined this group a month ago. I just play saxophone and am not a 
technician, but am very interested in the technical side of both 
saxophones and mouthpieces.

Today I received a Runyon alto mpc (made of plastic) and it needs a 
little bit of a finishing touch. The bottom of the throat (so the 
curve that&#39;s closest to the reed) is quite uneven, where it is 
supposed to be like the bottom of a "U".

I&#39;m just wondering if I can use the little glass filing stick of the 
Vandoren reed-adjusting set for this (it&#39;s like a round file with a 
fine grain) or is this too risky and should I consult someone with 
experience in mpc work?

Thanks,

Rocco

is an uneven shape inside the throat.  Runyons typically have seams there,
called "flash", from the injection molding process.  Just stay away from
nicking the side and tip rails.

thank you both for your advise. 
I removed the extra rims of the throat yesterday evening with the 
only round file I had (the fine grained glass one) and it turned out 
nicely.
Although I have to admit it would have been very easy to slip and 
damage the baffle/rail tip, I was lucky not to. I&#39;ll take more 
precautions next time!!
