            <pre class='message__body'>Having some problems refacing a WTII Link look-a-like. Now that I got 
the tip to match the reed curve and evened the rails and have a 
decent facing on it, I am getting a "gurgly" sound out of it. 
I think there is too much baffle in the way right at the tip - does 
this sound like a fair assessment?

There is a lot of flash looking meat hanging off the side rails too 
that I will get rid of, but I think this "gurgle" is a tip baffle 
problem. 
BTW - this metal is tough - remonds me of my SS Brilharts - only 
diamond files will touch it...
Thanks,
Patrick

You were quite right on the money as when I evened out the chamber a 
little more, the gurgle lifted a bit. So I continued down that path 
and it plays pretty well now. 
This is a great place to hang out and chat about mouthpieces - just 
wish we had beer and cigars...
