            <pre class='message__body'>  From my good friend, Tom Ridenour. Tom knows more about clarinets (and
making chili,
 and Southern history) than anyone on the planet. Often, the problem with
the horn is the reed, 
and we should all be certain we are starting correctly with a properly
adjusted reed. There are links 
to some other reed related videos on this site. Well worth checking out. Tom
is a very accessible sort of guy, and you can email him about his excellent
products and techniques at tom@... . Here&#39;s the

  The tools are very simple and I am sure when you buy the kit you will first think, "What a ripoff!  This is all I get?"  But you get a video, too.  Consider it like paying for a music lesson.  You are buying a technique that will pay for it self in the first box of reeds you make playable.  And unless a reed is split or otherwise to damaged to save, it can be made to play well giving you allmost 100% usage of your reed purchases.
   
  Tom demonstrated the playing tests, which test for 4 things.  The reed must play (1) softly, (2) loudly, (3) high, and (4) low.  If the reed can do those four things, it can do everything you, the player, need it to do.

            <pre class='message__body'>Another vote here for the Ridenour reed adjusting system!

I use Fibracell and I had saved a bunch of badly playing ones over the
years. The video makes the how-to part very clear, and the kit paid for
itself quickly, since Fibracells are almost $10 a pop.

Not to mention the great satisfaction and empowerment of really being able
to get almost any reed to play well (and getting some to play great).

It&#39;s a method that ought to be part of basic training for single-reed
players, IMHO.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ll throw in my two cents worth in about the Ridenour refacing kit. I
learned  about from my old clarinet teacher, Mike Dumouchel of the
Montreal SO. Mike was a frustrated read fixer for most of his career
until the Ridenour kit entered his life.
      The first reed I fixed was for tenor sax. It was the best playing
tenor reed I  have ever had. I have already made up for the cost of the
kit in more playable reeds, and I haven&#39;t even tried old boxes of reeds
that I could never get to play right before.
     Some advice:
    Stick to reeds that are just a little too hard to play on. When I try
to sand down a very hard reed I usually end up damaging the corners of
the tip before I get the reed just right.
    The only negative:
    It is so easy to get a good-playing reed that I tend to be more
careless about handling them and break them more often.      Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>It definitely is sometimes easy to take too much off the tip of the reed,
and as you have mentioned, switching to a slightly harder reed when using
Tom&#39;s method may be indicated, as the reed hardness will be taken down
somewhat by the adjustment.

I&#39;ve taped a thin feeler gauge to one end of my glass block, and sometimes
I&#39;ll slide the last 1/8 inch of the reed tip under it, in order to not
remove any further material.

On a persistently hard reed, I take a tip from the adjustment chart in the
Teal book, and use Tom&#39;s method to remove material from the bottom 1/3-1/4
of the vamp, without starting at the front of the reed.

            <pre class='message__body'>Talking of Fibracell, I read is not good to touch with any sending
papers because all reeds are covered with a thin film, so if the film
is out the reeds is gone! It&#39;s true Barry you do that? what about the
film on it? did you make it thin or just sand out? At Fibracell
factory they told me also film protect the material to absorb
humidity, that&#39;s why you can keep a reed for long time! In term of
this point what you can say? your sanded Fibracell play good but have
a shorter life?

            <pre class='message__body'>The Fibracell has a thin tough film attached on the bottom of the reed
(where the reed contacts the mouthpiece facing). Without the film, the tip
of the reed is too fragile.

Tom Ridenour&#39;s reed finishing system involves removing small amounts of
material from the top of the reed, so the thin film is not affected.

It does not appear that the top of a Fibracell is sealed in any way. I read
somewhere that these reeds are made of kevlar fiber embedded in a resin
matrix. They seem quite waterproof.

Fibracell reeds get softer after a while (a month or two in my experience)
but if set aside for a month, they seem to recover some stiffness. Perhaps
they do absorb some water, and recover if allowed to dry.

I have not noticed that un-adjusted Fibracells last longer than ones that
I&#39;ve had to adjust (taking material off the top of the reed). If there is a
difference, it&#39;s not obvious.

I use Fibracell and I had saved a bunch of badly playing ones over the

itself quickly, since Fibracells are almost $10 a pop.



Not to mention the great satisfaction and empowerment of really being able

Another vote here for the Ridenour reed adjusting system!

I use Fibracell and I had saved a bunch of badly playing ones over the
years. The video makes the how-to part very clear, and the kit paid for
itself quickly, since Fibracells are almost $10 a pop.

Not to mention the great satisfaction and empowerment of really being able
to get almost any reed to play well (and getting some to play great).

It&#39;s a method that ought to be part of basic training for single-reed
players, IMHO.

            <pre class='message__body'>I got this about 6 months ago.  It&#39;s worth it.  

Mr. Ridenour has made a very significant contribution to the science
and art of single-reed instrument playing.

            <pre class='message__body'>I also got one about 6 months ago and was impressed.  I now buy the 
hardest reeds I can get on Ebay, mainly because they sell the 
cheapest.  The way to not oversand the tips is to sacrifice a blade 
from your feeler gauge.  Put it on your glass surface with a drop of 
epoxy and weight it down.  Now, you can place the tip of the reed near 
the "jig" you&#39;ve built and cannot sand below that thickness (unless 
you move the reed tip farther away from the blade).  Trial and error.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Reed Adjusting Video</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>This method is also described by the late Ray Reed in his book "The
Saxophone Reed", in order to get a reed tip edge of desired thickness,
although he uses reed rush rather than the clever abrasive tool designed by
Tom Ridenour. 

Mr. Reed suggested measuring one&#39;s best-playing reeds in order to find out
what one&#39;s optimal tip thickness was, and to choose a feeler gauge thickness
accordingly. This was generally between .004 and .007 inch, and he noted
also that if the tone was "too thick" or the response too slow, the tip
needed some thinning, and that if the tone was "too thin", the tip had been
thinned out too much.

It&#39;s worth noting that the abrasive Ridenour tool gradually wears down the
thickness of the feeler gauge being used.
