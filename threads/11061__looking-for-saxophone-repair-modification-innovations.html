            <pre class='message__body'>dear mr. goodson,

a silent reader on your and others very interesting mouthpiece  
postings, probably the only one from indonesia where i currently live  
after moving from hollywood los angeles.

i like to contact you about the following:

i studied sax with bob berg and mike brecker in the late eighties in  
nyc, after graduating in amsterdam and the hague on the royal  
concervatorium and being awarded a stupendium by the dutch government.  
since then i always have been playing my francoise louis custom made  
mouthpiece, which i bought together with berg during those days. bob  
berg has been playing a similar mouthpeice till his unfortunate death.

now getting slightly older, this rather open mouthpiece asks too much  
air and becomes too hard to articulate the way i like it, and although  
i still like the sound it produces, it seems time to move away and  
explore different mouthpieces.

therefore i&#39;m looking for two type of vintage otto links:  the florida  
- super tone master, the one withthe two rings and the super tone  
master from later with one ring, the next generation florida&#39;s without  
a serial number. fabricated from the fities. also interested in a well  
playing usa tone master, produced around the 60ties.

preferably around their 7 / 7* tip opening

and was wondering if you could help me to buy these things. here in  
indonesia is not much to buy and when i was in europe last month i  
could not find the proper link for my horn.
i&#39;m playing a 78,000 VI.

looking forward hearing from you. best regards,

I&#39;m looking for some saxophone modifications that are innovative in   
hopes of making them the subject of a future article in The Saxophone  
Journal. I suspect that many of the innovations will come from the  
saxophone repair industry, and important part of the article will be  
to spotlight and recognize the innovator/technician. Saxophone related  
equipment such as mouthpieces, necks, stands, and other accessories  
are included. Here are a few requirements:

The modification must be something you can actually photograph. "John  
Doe makes my horn play great", although commendable, is not something  
you can photograph, unless, of course there is a specific something  
John Doe does that we can see…

The innovation has to be applicable to the general saxophone market,  
not just a one shot deal for a specific individual. For example, the  
"one handed" saxophone built for a stroke victim was astounding, but  
this has no application to the general market

Yes, you can certainly nominate yourself if you have a unique innovation

I am certain there is a lot of stuff I have not seen….please share it  
with me! I would appreciate it if you would include detailed photos  
with your submission.

            <pre class='message__body'>I recently found myself in a similar situation, that is, my old favorite

The facing was now too wide for me.

Why do you think an old Link is a potential replacement for your Francoise
Louis? Have you played some that you liked?  I&#39;ve not seen your
mouthpiece, but maybe some here on this formum can suggest something
similar for you to try. At the price you&#39;ll pay for an old Link, you have
many choices.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Looking for saxophone repair/modification  innovations</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>dear barry thanks for your reaction.

why a vintage link you asked?

going back to the basics - all the greats play otto link, i mean  
coltrane, stitt etc... of course this is a personal taste thing i  
realize that - no discussion intended, but that is the basic type of  
sound i prefer.

i&#39;ve seen some lesser known people on links that sounded real good too.

tried guardala, bobby dukoff etc, certainly like the edge but also  
like to also have some darker body in the sound of my horn. the  
francois louis gives me both, but is unfortunately so open that it not  
only slows down my articulation and at higher tempi the ability to  
place the note precisely, but i have to work too hard to control and  
keep the very substantial air stream constant. so the energy goes to  
the wrong things instead to the things that matter, picking the right  
notes.

also tried hard rubber links, meyers etc, i also play life, not only  
jazz but sometimes with rock bands and like to have some more volume  
and edge.

obviously open for all suggestions, because you are right these  
vintage links turn out terribly expensive and the inventory is limited.

best, jelle.

dear barry thanks for your reaction.

why a vintage link you asked?

going back to the basics - all the greats play otto link, i mean  
coltrane, stitt etc... of course this is a personal taste thing i  
realize that - no discussion intended, but that is the basic type of  
sound i prefer.

i&#39;ve seen some lesser known people on links that sounded real good too.

tried guardala, bobby dukoff etc, certainly like the edge but also  
like to also have some darker body in the sound of my horn. the  
francois louis gives me both, but is unfortunately so open that it not  
only slows down my articulation and at higher tempi the ability to  
place the note precisely, but i have to work too hard to control and  
keep the very substantial air stream constant. so the energy goes to  
the wrong things instead to the things that matter, picking the right  
notes.

also tried hard rubber links, meyers etc, i also play life, not only  
jazz but sometimes with rock bands and like to have some more volume  
and edge.

obviously open for all suggestions, because you are right these  
vintage links turn out terribly expensive and the inventory is limited.

best, jelle.

Why do you think an old Link is a potential replacement for your  
Francoise
Louis? Have you played some that you liked? I&#39;ve not seen your
mouthpiece, but maybe some here on this formum can suggest something
similar for you to try. At the price you&#39;ll pay for an old Link, you  
have
many choices.

dear barry thanks for your reaction.

why a vintage link you asked?

going back to the basics - all the greats play otto link, i mean
coltrane, stitt etc... of course this is a personal taste thing i
realize that - no discussion intended, but that is the basic type of
sound i prefer.

i&#39;ve seen some lesser known people on links that sounded real good too.

tried guardala, bobby dukoff etc, certainly like the edge but also
like to also have some darker body in the sound of my horn. the
francois louis gives me both, but is unfortunately so open that it not
only slows down my articulation and at higher tempi the ability to
place the note precisely, but i have to work too hard to control and
keep the very substantial air stream constant. so the energy goes to
the wrong things instead to the things that matter, picking the right
notes.

also tried hard rubber links, meyers etc, i also play life, not only
jazz but sometimes with rock bands and like to have some more volume
and edge.

obviously open for all suggestions, because you are right these
vintage links turn out terribly expensive and the inventory is limited.

best, jelle.

Ponzol M1 became less comfortable, more work to play, less reed

The facing was now too wide for me.

Why do you think an old Link is a potential replacement for your
Francoise
Louis? Have you played some that you liked? I&#39;ve not seen your
mouthpiece, but maybe some here on this formum can suggest something
similar for you to try. At the price you&#39;ll pay for an old Link, you
have
many choices.

            <div class='message__author'>FROM: moeaaron (Barry Levine)</div>
            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Looking for saxophone repair/modification innovations</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, it&#39;s not a happy situation, back to playing mouthpiece roulette,
after being happy with the same mouthpiece for years.

My own solution was to find a relatively inexpensive mouthpiece that
played fairly well for me and had a nice solid core to its tone (Selmer
S80) and to add a baffle insert to get the edge and projection I wanted - 
a piece of plastic with a sloped front edge that wedges into place,
similar to what you see in the Runyons.  This is an effective, easy, and
reversible mouthpiece modification. It adds edge and power to a mouthpiece
- at a small cost - the bottom register becomes slightly less easy. There
seems to be a trade-off.

I have not found it necessary to add the metal tail called a "spoiler."
