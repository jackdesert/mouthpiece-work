36 to 40 is where most sop sax mouthpieces facing lengths lie.  I would lean towards 38-40 and a maj/min ellipse of +6.  But I change how I lean depending on how the client describes what he wants.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your answer, very informative.  The mouthpiece is originally a
7*, and measure .072 at the tip. It seems to never have been refaced. My
client is a very well known Norwegian jazz saxophonist, and he got actually
three of these soprano pieces from an older Norwegian saxophone player many
years ago, because  he could not use them, they were too open for him. My
client just wants the mouthpiece to be as close to the original facing as
possible. I should just close it a bit for him.  He is going to use it on an
old Buescher sop sax.

 

I have refaced sop mouthpieces for him before, and then I used a facing
length at 40. Which  he was very satisfied with. So I will follow your
advice and go for your suggestion. 

 

Best Helge

I would be surprised if anyone has specs. Plus, whenever I measure lightly
used vintage mouthpieces and compare them to specs that do exist, they
usually do not match well. So are the specs off or the mouthpiece? A .065"
tip may not have even been available when vintage stubbys were made. So
asking for an original facing length is a bit arbitrary as it would have
probably been custom work to get a .065" tip.

36 to 40 is where most sop sax mouthpieces facing lengths lie. I would lean

        I think that makes the #7 - 18.5mm
                               #8 - 19mm long
