            <pre class='message__body'>Hi every one. I have a job for a client on a Otto Link Tone Edge sop piece with large chamber. He wants the length of the facing to be what it originally was ment to be. It&#39;s not possible to measure how it was because the facing is 20mm on the one side, and 16mm on the other. Does anybody here know how long the facing is supposed to be on these pieces? He wants the tip opening to be .065. 

Thanks 

Best Helge

            <pre class='message__body'>I would be surprised if anyone has specs.  Plus, whenever I measure lightly used vintage mouthpieces and compare them to specs that do exist, they usually do not match well.  So are the specs off or the mouthpiece?  A .065" tip may not have even been available when vintage stubbys were made.  So asking for an original facing length is a bit arbitrary as it would have probably been custom work to get a .065" tip.

36 to 40 is where most sop sax mouthpieces facing lengths lie.  I would lean towards 38-40 and a maj/min ellipse of +6.  But I change how I lean depending on how the client describes what he wants.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your answer, very informative.  The mouthpiece is originally a
7*, and measure .072 at the tip. It seems to never have been refaced. My
client is a very well known Norwegian jazz saxophonist, and he got actually
three of these soprano pieces from an older Norwegian saxophone player many
years ago, because  he could not use them, they were too open for him. My
client just wants the mouthpiece to be as close to the original facing as
possible. I should just close it a bit for him.  He is going to use it on an
old Buescher sop sax.

 

I have refaced sop mouthpieces for him before, and then I used a facing
length at 40. Which  he was very satisfied with. So I will follow your
advice and go for your suggestion. 

 

Best Helge

            <pre class='message__body'>You trying to machine an ellipse on a manual mill?  I tried it that way a couple of times before I had the CNC machine running.  It works.  If you&#39;re just plotting points to work from might as well just skip the tangent circle approximation and work from an ellipse.

            <pre class='message__body'>No.  Just wondering how 2 definite arcs would work compared to the ellipse.  Instead of a gradual change you&#39;d have a definite (though smooth, and movable) break point between the curve which facilitates reed frequency control and the curve which facilitates reed P-p response.

            <pre class='message__body'>I guess I am off as to what was available then.  All of the old Stubbys I see have tip openings under .050".  But I have not had a stuuby Link sent to me.

I see what you&#39;re getting at now.  I have seen some good playing curves that could maybe be described by this method but haven&#39;t thought of using it before now.  I&#39;m optimistic that it could be a useful method.  Interested to see how it pans out.
