            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, my advice is to get a new mouthpiece. 

Most epoxies contain chemicals that are not advisable to have in contact with your mouth and saliva, as they can leach out and affect the body. If you really need to keep this mouthpiece for some reason, your best bet IMO is to cannibalize a trash mouthpiece--cut off the 1/2 tip rail that is missing and graft it, ala Dr. Frankenstein, onto the broken mouthpiece. 

Obviously you will have to make the joint as neat as possible--sand or file the broken part straight and do the same with the replacement piece. You can join them with an epoxy called "J&B Weld". This is also nasty stuff, but at least the only part in contact with your mouth will be a thin line at the join. 

You&#39;ll have to make sure that the tip rail on the cannibalized piece is slightly higher than on the mpc so that you can sand it smooth and level without changing the original rail height. It would also be helpful if it were a bit thicker than the original so that you can sand the beak level with the rest of the mpc. 

Finally you&#39;ll have to use precision files to shape the inner chamber to match the rest of the mpc. Even then you risk the reed vibrations eventually loosening the joint--for absolute security you should carefully inlay a small brass plate that covers the two sides of the joint on the inside--being careful to have the plate flush with and matching the inner curve.

Perhaps others have better methods, but the upshot is that whatever method you use it is never going to be as strong as the original, and it is going to take a fair amount of time and skill. If this were a rare old Chedeville mpc I would recommend the effort, but since Vandorens are relatively cheap I think you would be much better off saving yourself a lot of time and grief for an iffy result and just spring for a new mpc. By the time you buy an old mpc for parts, JB Weld and the necessary files and sandpaper you could probably just about buy the new one.

Use slow set 24 hour epoxy which I find much harder than the quick set
variety.
You could experiment with the ratio of resin to hardener, instead of
the usual 50/50. I have not tried this myself.
De-grease the mouthpiece tip for good adhesion.
Apply electrical tape to the toothplate side, to contain the epoxy
until it sets.   Eddie

            <pre class='message__body'>Dental acrylic is the perfect solution, as it is completely non-toxic, and superglue is good as well, although I&#39;m not sure it would be strong enough. A good idea would be to join the two pieces on a bias, so that as the constant beating of the reed is pushing the repaired piece up it is pushing it against the hard rubber of the original mpc: // rather than ||, if you get what I mean.
