the 1960&#39;s from Dr. Ron Attinger, who was Professor Teal&#39;s first Phd.
student. He made us all use these pieces. I hated them! At the time I was
Dr. Attinger&#39;s student I was using a metal Berg 130/0 SMS on tenor, and it
was quite a change. I recall that the Teal mouthpieces were very much a "one
trick pony" with no flexibility. It was pretty good for playing the Ferling
etudes, but little else IMHO..and it&#39;s hard to make a living playing
Ferling!

This agrees with what I had been led to believe -- that the facings are
standard Selmer, but that the chamber is different.

This agrees pretty well with facings I have had success with for classical pieces of similar design (small, round chamber). Maj/min axis ratio I use is closer to 5, and length is 42 at the .0015 feeler.

If you have the software to view a Power Point slide show, take a look at the clinic area of my site.  There are slides showing what an elliptical facing curve shape looks like.  Ellipse shapes are defined by their major and minor axes.

We&#39;re talking about using an elliptical section rather than a radial (circular) section to define the facing curve. One way to define an ellipse is by the lengths of the two axes. When they are equal, the ellipse is a circle.

I&#39;m thinking of using an axis ratio of 5 and opening it up to a stock C* (.067, yes?).

I usually use a radial facing, kind of on the long side, for sax mouthpieces, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work well on some classical pieces. They lose a certain comfortable, reliable resistance. So - all of you guys who have worked on lots of legit pieces - does this sound like a good plan?

is a tiny tip opening, but it is definitely in line with the intended

classical players that play on Selmer mouthpieces with a tip opening  
of .058-.062 and using hard reeds.  One of the most popular U.S.  
refacers for these sorts players usually closes down Soloist and S80  
mouthpieces to around .060, and they are really popular.

Not trying to suggest that there is anything wrong with opening it up,  
just want to make sure you know it isn&#39;t "wrong".

Yes, the larger tip opening, .066"-.068" (around 1.70 mm), with about 21 mm facing length (42 on a Brand type scale) will greatly improve the LT.

The tenor LT is atrocious!  I don&#39;t know what Larry Teal was thinking, but the tenor LT has a cold, hard, lifeless tone.

For the tenor LT, open to .078"-.080" (about 2.00 mm), with a 22-23 mm facing length (44-46 on the Brand scale).

You will then not have to play #4 reeds, can back off to a softer reed with better low register and warmer tone.

I&#39;ve done this on a number of LT&#39;s and Soloist tenors. 

The C* facing is much too small for tenor sax... the D and E much better.

            <pre class='message__body'>While I agree that tenor LT&#39;s are practically useless by modern convention
due to their very small tip opening, I don&#39;t see much point in opening up an
alto LT, specifically, other than it being a blank that someone has
available to them to have modified.

I feel the alto LT is what it is BECAUSE of it&#39;s small tip opening (and
longer facing).  I&#39;m not convinced the round chamber vs. horseshoe chamber
vs. square chamber ("does throat shape matter?" discussion) really makes
much of a difference.

I may be biased because I played an LT on alto for a long time so I feel I
"get" what they are all about, but once an LT is opened to greater than a C*
facing, my opinion is that you might as well have started with a Soloist.

I&#39;m not against refacing them - I&#39;m just not in support of modifying them
heavily.

After 37 years of being a dedicated Selmer products consumer, it has become obvious to me that the quality and the results of the saxophone and clarinet products are inconsistent and the only way to pick a winner and leave happy is to carefully play test as big a batch of the item that you are considering for purchase as possible. Narrow down and separate the winners from the rejects and retest. Personal tastes also play a big part in this discussion and product selection.

Is this a Canadian currency, tax or inflation joke?
