            <pre class='message__body'>I believe the facing is longer and the tip opening is smaller....I&#39;ve got
one somewhere, and will try to find it and compare it....I took lessons in
the 1960&#39;s from Dr. Ron Attinger, who was Professor Teal&#39;s first Phd.
student. He made us all use these pieces. I hated them! At the time I was
Dr. Attinger&#39;s student I was using a metal Berg 130/0 SMS on tenor, and it
was quite a change. I recall that the Teal mouthpieces were very much a "one
trick pony" with no flexibility. It was pretty good for playing the Ferling
etudes, but little else IMHO..and it&#39;s hard to make a living playing
Ferling!

            <pre class='message__body'>I have found alto curves unforgiving even for a small discrepancy to the
proposed facing and thus making it resistant. You have to stick religiously
to the schedule. Vintage Meyer curve is a wonder up to .080 and you can find
the schedule on the forum.
Hope this helps,

            <pre class='message__body'>I just came into possession of a Larry Teal alto piece, and I plan to try an elliptical facing on it.  It measures very small (about .060) but
I&#39;m thinking of using an axis ratio of 5 and opening it up to a stock C* (.067, yes?).

I usually use a radial facing, kind of on the long side, for sax mouthpieces, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work well on some classical pieces. They lose a certain comfortable, reliable resistance. So - all of you guys who have worked on lots of legit pieces - does this sound like a good plan?

is a tiny tip opening, but it is definitely in line with the intended

of .058-.062 and using hard reeds.  One of the most popular U.S.  
refacers for these sorts players usually closes down Soloist and S80  
mouthpieces to around .060, and they are really popular.

Not trying to suggest that there is anything wrong with opening it up,  
just want to make sure you know it isn&#39;t "wrong".

That&#39;s pretty close to what I use in this situation. True length about 23mm so .0015 feeler ~41. Nothing wrong with .060, though, FWIW.

Yes, the larger tip opening, .066"-.068" (around 1.70 mm), with about 21 mm facing length (42 on a Brand type scale) will greatly improve the LT.

The tenor LT is atrocious!  I don&#39;t know what Larry Teal was thinking, but the tenor LT has a cold, hard, lifeless tone.

For the tenor LT, open to .078"-.080" (about 2.00 mm), with a 22-23 mm facing length (44-46 on the Brand scale).

You will then not have to play #4 reeds, can back off to a softer reed with better low register and warmer tone.

I&#39;ve done this on a number of LT&#39;s and Soloist tenors. 

The C* facing is much too small for tenor sax... the D and E much better.

            <pre class='message__body'>While I agree that tenor LT&#39;s are practically useless by modern convention
due to their very small tip opening, I don&#39;t see much point in opening up an
alto LT, specifically, other than it being a blank that someone has
available to them to have modified.

I feel the alto LT is what it is BECAUSE of it&#39;s small tip opening (and
longer facing).  I&#39;m not convinced the round chamber vs. horseshoe chamber
vs. square chamber ("does throat shape matter?" discussion) really makes
much of a difference.

I may be biased because I played an LT on alto for a long time so I feel I
"get" what they are all about, but once an LT is opened to greater than a C*
facing, my opinion is that you might as well have started with a Soloist.

I&#39;m not against refacing them - I&#39;m just not in support of modifying them
heavily.

After 37 years of being a dedicated Selmer products consumer, it has become obvious to me that the quality and the results of the saxophone and clarinet products are inconsistent and the only way to pick a winner and leave happy is to carefully play test as big a batch of the item that you are considering for purchase as possible. Narrow down and separate the winners from the rejects and retest. Personal tastes also play a big part in this discussion and product selection.

Is this a Canadian currency, tax or inflation joke?

            <pre class='message__body'>  A question regarding this.....what does an axis ratio of 5 mean?   As a non math guy I am trying to understand some basic concepts here.  thanks
