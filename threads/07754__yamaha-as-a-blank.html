            <pre class='message__body'>They seem to be a mixture of ground up hard rubber and plastic.  I&#39;ve refaced a couple of these.  The chamber design is fairly conservative.  The soprano pieces are quite decent.

Andrew

I re-layed one that had a broken tip. It was easy to work on and the dust was a blue/grey colour.The owner says it is his favourite MPC even though I sold him a Lawton7* Go figure?

            <pre class='message__body'>The "standard" Yamaha mouthpieces are made of a hard composite material.
They also make the mouthpiece in ebonite (hard rubber) with the same facings but claimed to be hand finished.  In the UK the ebonite versions are about 2-3 times the price of the standard ones, but still somewhat less than say Vandoren.
