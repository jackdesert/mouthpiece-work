Went to see KC and the Sunshine Band last weekend....does anyone know 
what kind of a setup their tenor player uses....?
Don&#39;t even know his name, but it&#39;s the same guy as last year, so I 
guess he&#39;s their regular...

Failing that, knowing how to describe his "sound", would be useful...
I don&#39;t have anything like his chops, but that&#39;s the direction I&#39;d 
like to be going...

Any KC fans out there...?
Ross
