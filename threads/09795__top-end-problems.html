            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I&#39;ve recently received an alto mouthpiece from an American maker.

It&#39;s bright, with good volume and quite good tone( little nasal down lower register below "G")  but when I go up from 3rd register "D" it becomes increasingly unstable.

It looks as though it&#39;s based on the Meyer but has a pronounced roll over that extends for approx 1/2 an inch before it ducks down.
The throat is wide open. The rails are thicker than the Meyer ( about 3/32nds).

What I want to know is what contributes to top end instability?

I suppose the pronounced baffle is the main culprit.
I can see the facing curves rather sharply about 3/8ths from the tip end. Should this curve be more regular?

Thanks for any advice,

David

I&#39;ll bet the problem is the "wide open throat", rather than the rollover baffle.  

Increasing the "bore" or throat or otherwise hogging out the chamber does not make it louder or more "free blowing".  The air velocity in a mouthpiece is very low and aerodynamics has little effect except in the region of the baffle right after the tip rail.  The air column produces its tone via a standing wave.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Top end problems

  
Hi,

I&#39;ve recently received an alto mouthpiece from an American maker.

It&#39;s bright, with good volume and quite good tone( little nasal down lower 
register below "G") but when I go up from 3rd register "D" it becomes 
increasingly unstable.

It looks as though it&#39;s based on the Meyer but has a pronounced roll over that 
extends for approx 1/2 an inch before it ducks down.
The throat is wide open. The rails are thicker than the Meyer ( about 3/32nds).

What I want to know is what contributes to top end instability?

I suppose the pronounced baffle is the main culprit.
I can see the facing curves rather sharply about 3/8ths from the tip end. Should 
this curve be more regular?

Thanks for any advice,

David

            <pre class='message__body'>Just what kind of instability are we talking about here?  Is it just too flexible or does it tend to be too sharp?  A facing curve that is too long can bee too flexible, distinct pitch tendencies are another issue.

Your reed choice and embouchure also contributes. Other players may have more/less problems with the same mouthpiece because of these factors.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah, what Morgan said.  

Did you try a Fibracell reed?  They are just about squeak proof even if the 
facing has issues.  I have a FAQ answer on my site about squeaks.

If it squeals easily and responds poorly, I would look for high spots on the 
curve, and check the symmetry of the curve and tip against the glass gauge, and 
look for any obvious imbalance in baffle height near the tip.
