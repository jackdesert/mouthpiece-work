            <pre class='message__body'>Well I just called Ferrees and Int&#39;nalMusicSupply hoping to buy a
measuring plate for mouthpiece work. Ferree&#39;s states that Ralph is way
behind and they don&#39;t have an expected shipping date.

Are there other sources for the measuring gauge? Is there a
description so I could build my own? ("I&#39;ll likely do this anyway).

Just looking for a suggestion.

thanks,
