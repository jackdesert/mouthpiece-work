            <pre class='message__body'>Good day guys
 

 

 I refaced this mouthpiece and on the process i noticed side rails became thicker. I just want to know if it is possible to make the side rails thinner? And how to do it..
 

 

 What is the effect of the thick side rails on this mouthpiece??
 

 

 Thank you

            <pre class='message__body'>if the side rail is too wide after the excess on the outside is removed, the inside of the rail should also be thinned…..thin rails = quick response, quick articulation……wide rails = slower articulation, slower response, dead sounding tone

But the area of the side rails in contact with the reed shouldn’t change as a result of thinning those rails *from the outside* - the reed width doesn’t change and it extends over the rails from the window. Thinning from the outside, to my mind, only thins the area of rail that’s exposed beyond the edge of the reed. Why does this affect the reed’s response one way or the other?

            <pre class='message__body'>I find thin side rails near the tip behave like thin tip rails.  Like an extension of it.  Farther away from the tip it has gradually less effect.

I always cut the sides width down to the Reed width.  This helps with centering the reed.    The inside rail shape depends on the job with me.

            <pre class='message__body'>Use files and sandpaper on thick material to make it thin.

I show it in some of my videos.
