            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
I&#39;ve been a member, but I don&#39;t think I have ever posted anything!

I don&#39;t know anything about refacing or repair, but I am interested 
in learning more about basic mpc repair before I get into refacing.

Is there a website that has all the basics on it? Like tools, where 
to start, etc? Does repair seem fairly easy and is it a good place 
to start?

Thanks a bunch,
Bonnie White

The information on this site is the most complete collection of 
mouthpiece information there is.  Look through the Messages, Files, 
Links and Photos.  It is organized in a step-by-step way, but most of 
what you need is already here.  You can ask questions about what you 
can not find.

I think the best way to get started is by using a temporary putty to 
make various baffle shapes in a test mouthpiece.  This can be done 
without damaging a mouthpiece.  Later, you can progress to using 
epoxy putties to make more permanent baffles.

Tooth deck repair is another area a beginner can work at without 
damaging a facing.  Shank crack banding is another one.  Chip and 
nick repair usually requires some facing skills.

There are three things you need to do to get started with refacing: 
Measure, measure, and measure.   You&#39;ll need glass guage, feeler 
guages, and a way to measure tip openings (wand, calipers, or depth 
guage).  You need to be able to measure the same piece and get the 
same results, within reason.  Otherwise you will be trying to correct 
facing defects that may just be you measurement errors.  I think 
spent about 6 months measuring and plotting facing curves before I 
reworked my first piece.  This amount of time is not neccessary, but 
I was really interested in studying the various curve shapes.  I 
eventually concluded that most of the odd shapes I was studying were 
manufacturing defects, not mouthpiece features.
