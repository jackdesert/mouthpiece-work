            <pre class='message__body'>Hi All,
Is anyone familiar with Serfcote, the bite plate material used by 
Phil Barone and others, and where it can be obtained?
A search web search netted some interesting facts concerning 
a "sludge" spill in Alaska.
Thanks for any help,
Rich

            <pre class='message__body'>I dunno.  It may be spelled differently, like SurfCoat.  Maybe Phil 
will chime in.

I use a 2-part black acrylic I got from McMaster-Carr.

Can you tell me if the product below is the stuff you&#39;re using

I&#39;m starting from scratch for bite plates so would like to get

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice find on the Surfcoat.  I was just stabbin&#39; in the dark for 
alternate names.  So ya think 5 gallons will last you a while?

That DP-810 is the black acrylic I got from McMaster-Carr for about 
$12.50 + s/h.  It comes in a cartridge for a dual plunger gun.  I was 
too cheap to buy a $35 gun for a test.  I made a dual plunger from a 
couple of pieces of wood dowel screwed to a thin rectangular piece of 
wood.  Worked fine.

This stuff sets differently than epoxy.  You can kind of work epoxy 
into a final shape as it sets.  Not so with this acrylic.  It "jells" 
in 10 minutes but takes another 24 hrs to harden.  It is thin 
initially so I found putting tape on the sides of the Link was a good 
idea to make a form to keep it in place.  I got a few bubbles in my 
first try.  I was able to patch them later, but I would recommend 
tapping the piece to get any bubbles to rise and using a thin probe 
to pop them.  Do this in the first few minutes, tap it some to help 
it seek a level, then leave it the ffff alone.  

Once hardened, it hand files nice, but it is easy to scratch the 
metal mouthpiece with the file.  Try not to overfill to minimze the 
needed shaping work.
