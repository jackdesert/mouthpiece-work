Keith,

Having started at Msg #1, and finally getting this far, I have noticed
2 things:

1. A lot of newbies post a first message asking "what do I need to get
started doing MPC refacing/repair"?

2.  You always reply "check out the earlier posts".

Wouldn&#39;t it serve you better that, when you send the e-mail welcoming
them to the group, that you include a statement for them to check out
the first posts and files area before they ask the question?

Just a suggestion,

Thank you,

David

            <pre class='message__body'>I think I can do that.  But the message was added right on the home page of
the Yahoo MP Work site.  I added it after several of those ealier posts. 
Did you see it on the home page?  Maybe I&#39;ll add a message to read the home
page.
