Lately I have been noticing a lot of pieces with off-center chambers
and was wondering a lot if this detracts from an efficient piece. I
can&#39;t imagine it could help in any way...

I would expect the off-center ones to sound a little edgy and/or have some
wind noise.  But that would be due to the sharp edges.  An off-center
chamber with a beveled lead in/out might play exactly the same as an
on-center one.

  It would be interesting to do a controled test.  Perhaps saw a mouthpiece
  into 3 sections and clamp or lightly glue the mid section on and off
  center.

  I would expect the off-center ones to sound a little edgy and/or have some
  wind noise.  But that would be due to the sharp edges.  An off-center
  chamber with a beveled lead in/out might play exactly the same as an
  on-center one.

  I wouldn&#39;t guess it would make much difference if the internal specs were the same--you have to have a pretty tight bend before it starts to affect the way the air column behaves significantly, according to what I have read.
