            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

Ive been reading posts and observing for many months now and have
worked on about 30 mouthpieces to this point.  I noticed that several
"academic" articles and resources have been discussed.  I am working
on a DMA at the University of Illinois and have access to a ton of
literature, articles, books, etc.  If there are any specific texts
anyone would like to observe, I would be more than happy to dig them
up and post them. I have the entire Wyman dissertation in PDF form,
however it is slightly too large for me to post in the files section.
I know many people had ordered it or were planning on buying it.
Dissertations are now digital so there is no charge for these papers
anymore.  If anyone would like a PDF of it, email me or maybe Keith
knows a way one of these larger files could be posted.

Thanks for all the help through these posts,

Dick Kelley

I would say we are all looking to increase our knowledge in this area.  In fact, the UMI company is going to stop distributing hard copies on items that have been transferred to PDF.  In addition, UMI is working with Google to possibly publish many of the dissertations on the google books website.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Dick,

I would certainly appreciate a copy if you don&#39;t find a way to post it. 

As far as posting goes: you could upload it to a file-sharing site such as rapidshare.com. Both uploading and downloading (with certain constraints which wouldn&#39;t matter here) is free.

  the file size is 5.3MB.  It is legal, since the Dissertation website allows for the digital sharing of their resources for educational purposes.  I would say we are all looking to increase our knowledge in this area.  In fact, the UMI company is going to stop distributing hard copies on items that have been transferred to PDF.  In addition, UMI is working with Google to possibly publish many of the dissertations on the google books website.  I checked with my head librarian at the University before even mentioning this on the website.  Let me know if you would like to try to post it.  If not, Im willing to email it to those interested.  

  Thanks,
  Dick Kelley

  Hi all,

  Ive been reading posts and observing for many months now and have
  worked on about 30 mouthpieces to this point. I noticed that several
  "academic" articles and resources have been discussed. I am working
  on a DMA at the University of Illinois and have access to a ton of
  literature, articles, books, etc. If there are any specific texts
  anyone would like to observe, I would be more than happy to dig them
  up and post them. I have the entire Wyman dissertation in PDF form,
  however it is slightly too large for me to post in the files section.
  I know many people had ordered it or were planning on buying it.
  Dissertations are now digital so there is no charge for these papers
  anymore. If anyone would like a PDF of it, email me or maybe Keith
  knows a way one of these larger files could be posted.

  Thanks for all the help through these posts,

If you can read it (adobe acrobat), you should be able to print selected
pages.

It&#39;s quite a large file. If you can download it, would be worth the trouble
to burn the pdf to a CD and bringing in to a copy center, for a complete
copy.

It is actually more like 3/8" thick.  184 pages.  

I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Wyman last January.  We were both at 
the annual Sax Symposium hosted by the US Navy Band outside Wash, DC.  
I made it a point to tell him what a wonderful piece of work his paper 
is.

The version of Acrobat reader I have has an icon of a floppy disk at 
the top.  When I put the mouse over it, the help "bubble" says "Save a 
copy", so I did. 

It&#39;s not obvious in my situation because Acrobat comes up embedded in 
the browser, so the "File/Edit/View/Favorites" at the top of the 
screen still apply to the browser and not Acrobat.  The save button 
was at the top of the page being displayed and not the top of the 
window.
