I have suffered the same problem with my home made glass gauge sliding
around on a Graftonite clarinet piece I am working on. Thanks to
Sigmund451 for the wetting suggestion, it seems to work.

I also thought of trying two vertical scratches, made with a glass
cutter, maybe 5mm apart, on the part of the gauge that rests on the
MPC table. I have not seen a Babbitt gauge but I understsnd from a
previous post, that the scale is etched on the underside.This might
give a bit of friction.

I delayed this post,in case someone thought it was an April 1st joke.

The etching really doesnt do anything to add significant friction.  I 
find it especially challenging on metal pieces.  I guess my hand isnt 
that steady.  If the table is flat and I just touch the tip of my 
tounge to the table thats enought to hold well.  I suppose a glass of 
water would be more sanitary but I really dont care.  I find such a 
difference I will likely continue doing it on all pieces.  It really 
grips nicely. 

As a side note I finally finished my metal piece.  I think I will stick 
to hard rubber for a while.  I find it MUCH easier.  It also helps when 
you dont get dyslexic with target numbers.  What a mess to clean up!
