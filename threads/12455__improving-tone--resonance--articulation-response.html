            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Folks,
I’ve been a member of this forum for about a year and a half and have learned a lot by reading everyone’s posts. I’ve been trying to hone my abilities with the basics before diving into asking questions about shaping the sound/feel of a mouthpiece. But I’ve reached a wall and need some advice. I use Mojo’s spreadsheet (an invaluable tool, btw, thanks so much for making it available) for plotting facing curves and Theo Wanne’s gage glass and feeler gages.

I’ve recently been applying a facing to a generic Chinese-made metal alto piece (pics attached). The chamber is a Berg-style bullet chamber so I modelled the curve after a modern hard rubber 85/1 SMS Berg Larsen that was refaced to .080 with a facing length of about 44 on an overall curve of radius 5.

The piece I’m working on currently has an opening of .080 with the following measurements on the glass: 42, 32, 23, 18.5, 12.5, 4. At medium and higher volumes the tone is okay, but not outstanding. At softer volumes, it is dull and stuffy with no resonance at all, especially in the range middle G to high C. I’m not quite sure where to go with it to address these issues. So, some questions I have:

1. Specifically, what aspect of this piece should I be focusing my attention on to gain a clearer tone, greater resonance, and better articulation/response throughout the range of the instrument?

2. As far as I can tell, the table is flat, but in order to get good compression and a good sound, the piece requires the ligature to be placed well forward on the reed, such that it overhangs the cutaway where the beak joins the body of the mouthpiece. I notice the end of the window is pretty far back on the table, could the window be too long relative to the facing length?

3. Generally, is it possible to make any mouthpiece with any given chamber dimensions play well simply by application of an appropriate facing curve and shaping of the baffle. Or is there always some need to work the chamber shape, too?

My apologies for the novel length post, but I thought it best to give some details of the situation. Any advice you can give is much appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg Squared.

            <pre class='message__body'>It is helpful to realize that the facing controls the mechanical efficiency of the reed&#39;s flow profile while the baffle height and shape and reed channel shape and volume, control the acoustical efficiency of the same.  
A good facing is just the beginning.

Your curve plots decent except for the very tip.  If your tip rail is around .020" thick, then your facing curve indicates that the tip opening inside the tip rail should be around .086", not .080".

Does mechanical efficiency then translate into reed response and ease of blowing, i.e. more freeblowing, as opposed to more resistant?

I'm assuming this means chamber combined with the character of the reed determine the color of the sound and the dynamic range of the mouthpiece.

Good to know. Looks like I'm going to have to dive into the chamber.

I haven't been able to get the curve of the tip to fall in line with the curve of the rest of the piece. What I usually do is sand the tip down until there's a pretty hefty tip rail, then remove material on the baffle. Would a better approach for that be to shape the tip rail from the front edge rather than by cutting down the baffle?

If the tip of the mouthpiece gets sharp from opening the tip, then it is good to thin the tip rail from the outside to make the end blunt somewhat.  Otherwise, thinning the tip rail from the inside is used more in my experience.

You need to determine if your tip opening reading is a measurement error or if it really is smaller that what the rest of the facing curve needs.  If it is smaller, it will not play well.  

Here is a short video I made on zeroing my tip gauges.

http://youtu.be/KXgF2OXnxhA

Accuracy is not addressed in this video but it is usually not a big issue compared to zeroing and technique.  You can check tip openings with inside calipers too.  If you can get a couple of different gauges to agree on the tip opening within .001" you are probably OK.  

I have a set of gauge blocks to check my gauges for accuracy.  But I think they are overkill.  I use them to help check new gauges I purchase.

Not the chamber, the baffle. The baffle work is as important as the facing
if not even more. I routinely spend 2 times more time on the baffle than
the facing. You can fish for overtones there, make it free blowing or
resistant, basically every aspect of the mouthpiece making is available to
adjust with a touch.

            <pre class='message__body'>I spend way more time on the facing than the baffle.  Facing work is tedious.  Measure, adjust, repeat.  Takes 1-3 hours.  

My clients usually like the sound of a mouthpiece sent to me but not the response.  But some want sound changes or both.   Some baffles are too high near the tip to respond well.

" Good to know. Looks like I&#39;m going to have to dive into the chamber" 


Not the chamber, the baffle. The baffle work is as important as the facing if not even more. I routinely spend 2 times more time on the baffle than the facing. You can fish for overtones there, make it free blowing or resistant, basically every aspect of the mouthpiece making is available to adjust with a touch.

You need to determine if your tip opening reading is a measurement error or if it really is smaller that what the rest of the facing curve needs. If it is smaller, it will not play well. 



Here is a short video I made on zeroing my tip gauges. 


http://youtu.be/KXgF2OXnxhA 


Accuracy is not addressed in this video but it is usually not a big issue compared to zeroing and technique. You can check tip openings with inside calipers too. If you can get a couple of different gauges to agree on the tip opening within .001" you are probably OK. 


I have a set of gauge blocks to check my gauges for accuracy. But I think they are overkill. I use them to help check new gauges I purchase.

I&#39;d like to see a depth gauge that can measure the height of
the baffle at fixed distances from the tip rail, in order to have some
semi-reproducible targets for the slope and curvature of the baffle in
that region. That might make the fishing a little more productive,
timewise.

            <pre class='message__body'>Good way to start  thinking of the baffles is by the angle they meet the
tip rail.
If they meet the tip rail in a straight flat manner the sound will be
bright, very well articulating and free blowing. The opposite is when there
is curvy entrance- rich dark, resistant and not articulating well. I try to
balance those attributes to have elements of both, suppressing undesirable
ones. For illustration, If you are carving nice tip rail you are doing that
by taking off the material from the baffle. That motion also makes the
second entrance I explained and have immediate impact how the baffle
responds. I get terrified when I see people use buffing wheels on the
baffle. Maybe works well for them in their universe, but to me it is
washing down the drain several hours of work.
Every baffle style is a story of its own with its own set of rules, what
works what doesn&#39;t. A lot of this knowledge is intuitive and myself haven&#39;t
thought of it putting it to words. I&#39;m just going there plow the baffle
looking for the tone I have in my mind until I get the smile of
satisfaction while playing it. If in few days I&#39;m happy with the sound the
same way like after the first day I consider it finished.

            <pre class='message__body'>The baffle profile influences when/how quickly the reed closes during each cycle (Bernoulli force).  Baffle too high = reed snaps shut early = bright sound + resistance/backs up.  Baffle too low = reed closes slowly = dull sound - you have to blow too hard to get desired presence = resistance.  So, resistance either way.  There is a narrow window where the Bernoulli force compliments your blowing pressure sweet spot, and when you find it, you have Mouthpiece Magic.  The overall baffle and reed channel shape are factors, so there is no one universal baffle height that will get you there.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes. I find that if the angle of a somewhat flat baffle is too shallow 
where it meets the tip rail, the tone may be too bright. Upper register 
and altissimo sing easily, but middle and lower registers are thin. For 
example, I&#39;ve been working on a Chinese metal mouthpiece with this 
problem, and as I slope the baffle a bit further away (which means lots 
of filing) the tone has gotten rounder.
    Maybe this mouthpiece would be more suitable for cane, but as I play 
synthetic reeds that are rather bright, this combination of mouthpiece

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your response.

I see that you&#39;re measuring the depth, and that you&#39;ve gotten profiles 
of the baffles

But I don&#39;t see how you&#39;re getting fixed distances from the bottom of 
the table, as you say. Did you create some marks on the baffle?

And I&#39;d think that the distance from the tip that would be more accurate 
than measuring from the bottom of the table, which could vary among 
production runs.

If the depth gauge had an adjustable arm that acted as a variable 
distance stop from the tip, that would work on a flat baffle. If the 
baffle had an arc across its width, the center line would need to be marked.

            <pre class='message__body'>To measure baffle profiles, I have a scale of notches marked along the side of my tip gauge.   The scale zero is about 1.5" away from the gauge probe.  I place the pointed tip probe on the tip of the mouthpiece and then I place a white mark on the side of the mouthpiece where the zero point on the scale is.  Then I slide the notches in the gauge one by one to the white mark and take depth readings to the baffle.  I take readings at 3, 7, 12, 18, and 25 mm from the tip. 
 

 I show this in my videos somewhere.  But I have over 50 videos so I have trouble finding a particular clip sometimes.
