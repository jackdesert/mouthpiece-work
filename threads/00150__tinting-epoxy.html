            <pre class='message__body'>It was asked how to tint epoxy.

In the latest Micromark catalog (www.micromark.com), page 51, there are
pigments for epoxy, polyester, and urethane casting resins.  For the
ivory or offwhite color, you would need

#82134 White, 1 oz bottle  $4.95
#82136 Red  $4.95
#82139 Green  $4.95

or whole set of 8 colors, #82142  Set of 8    $29.95

Catalog says it is very concentrated, and only a few drops of pigment
needed for full color.

You would need to mix red and green to give a brown shade.  Then mix a
very small amount of the brown into some white to give an offwhite/ivory
color.  Perhaps a little yellow.  When I custom mix colors (for HO scale
model railroading) I do it outdoors in natural light.

Though I have not used the particular brand of tinting pigments above, I
have used similar stuff for tinting epoxy and polyester resins.

MicroMark also sells a brown #82141.

            <pre class='message__body'>Missed that... I am used to mixing primary colors.  Yes, a brown, with
perhaps a tinge of yellow when added to white can make a good cream or
ivory.
