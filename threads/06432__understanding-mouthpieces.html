            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know where to start my questions. I&#39;ve got a bunch of &#39;em :)

A friend loaned me a box of tenor mouthpieces to try, among them three Otto Link Super Tone Masters (7, 8, & 9). Far as I can tell they haven&#39;t had any work done on them.

For reference, I&#39;ve been playing alto & tenor for almost three years now after a 38 year hiatus. I&#39;m playing mostly tenor in two community bands and a 13 pc big band, gigging a couple times a month. I&#39;ve been using a Rico Royal Graftonite B5 mouthpiece, with (mostly) Rico Royal 2.5 reeds. I use the Tom Ridenour ATG reed finishing methods.

To my surprise, the 9 is the freest blowing of the bunch. I&#39;d never been able to play very open mouthpieces on my alto.
But this 9 plays high & low, loud or soft much easier than my B5. I love the ease with which I can add inflections to my sound, yet still play in tune.
It seems to handle large intervals easier than the others. (I have problems going smoothly from high A to middle D with most MP&#39;s.)
The timbre change from C#2 to D2 seems less than with other MP&#39;s. It also seems more reed friendly than the 7 or 8. I see an obvious flat area about 0.6" from the tip on both rails.
The tip opening measured 0.114" which puts it closer to an 8*.
If it were for sale I&#39;d snatch it up.

The No. 8 seemed prone to squeeks and was hard to play - lots of resistance. I can&#39;t see why by looking at it. Couldn&#39;t find a reed that it liked so I didn&#39;t work much with it.

The No. 7 required more effort to blow than the 9, and was more finicky on reeds. I have to work harder to get "my sound" with it.

Questions:

How could the 9 be easiest to play with a monster tip opening?

What makes a mouthpiece prone to squeaks?

What makes a MP finicky on reeds that will work well?

From my reading I understand that the larger tip openings should be reserved for players more developed than me.
Yet the largest seems to work best for me.
How do I determine what opening is best for me?

If I&#39;m buying a new STM (or something else) do I need to get several of each size to find a "good" one?

I&#39;ve read that thinner rails makes a MP more responsive. What does that mean?

What rail thickness works best on the STM&#39;s?

For those with the expertise and inclination I&#39;ve uploaded a xls file of the facing curve for this STM 9.
I&#39;m not to great with Excel so bear with me.
I don&#39;t have the traditional glass gage so I set up the MP on my mill table and measured down to it from the quill with a dial indicator.
See the photos in my album Facing Measurment.  This is a painstaking way to measure and wouldn&#39;t lend itself to working on the facing.

Any comments on this facing curve?

I also mapped the baffle curve and can add that to the spreadsheet if anyones interested.

Where can I get a glass gage reasonably priced?

KB> After you turn the curve you probably can take fewer readings.  10-12 readings are usually enough to capture a facing curve.
 
Any comments on this facing curve?

KB>It looks way too flat going towards the tip.  But if it plays well for you, dont mess with it.  I would carefully evaluate the high note and altissimo response.  It may also sound a bit buzzy from the reed slapping against the flat section.

KB>If the tip is too open for you, you will find intonation difficult to control after playing for a couple of hours.  You may even find yourself playing on the very tip to close off some of the tip opening.  Just be aware of this possibility.  If this is not happening then your chops have recovered well after the layoff.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

Thanks for your response and for reminding me to re-read your FAQ&#39;s :)

You are on target with the Buzzy comment. This MP does have a slight buzzy character compared to the other two STM&#39;s.

I&#39;ve always had a tendency to bite and have been working to break the habit. Maybe I am closing the STM 9 some with excessive pressure.
I&#39;ll watch for that.

Even though the STM 7 & 9 and the Rico Royal B5 feel and sound different to me when I&#39;m playing, they sound almost identical when I record with them.

Thanks again,
Tom
