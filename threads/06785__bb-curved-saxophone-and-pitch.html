            <pre class='message__body'>I have the beginner mouthpiece that came with my curved Bb saxophone.  
When I play in the community band, it depends on where our pitch it but 
just sitting with a tuner myself, I see that I&#39;m about 40 to 50 cents 
flat on a cold horn.  I use a 3.5 Vandoren reed and I can play in the 
altissimo register even playing a super C.  However, it&#39;s my pitch that 
I&#39;m concerned about.  I&#39;ve even tried biting but to no avail of raising 
the pitch.  I even have teeth marks in my beginner mouthpiece that came 
with the horn itself.

I have used a Rousseau mouthpiece thinking this will raise the pitch but 
it&#39;s still flat.  I have put on a Rovner ligature on the beginner 
mouthpiece and some way I had it set, the pitch came up immediately.  So 
I&#39;m wondering if the problem is the horn being curved and if I should 
get a straight Bb soprano saxophone or what?  Will I have these same 
tuning problems with the Eb Sopranino saxophone that&#39;s straight?  Have I 
heard "right" that the problems with the "soprano" saxophone is that 
they blow/play flat?

Please advise.

            <pre class='message__body'>You don&#39;t say what make and model curved soprano you are using...very often,
intonation problems such as you describe are caused by a mismatch of the
horn and the mouthpiece. To give a simple answer to a complex issue, think
of the neck of your saxophone as a truncated cone. The missing portion of
the cone has a volume that can be calculated. The chamber of the mouthpiece
also has a volume that can be calculated. Compare these two numbers. The
further apart they are, the worse your intonation will be.
 
Of course, this may not be the only issue, but it is a very common problem.

This type of question would be better to post on a general sax forum like

Keith, I have just sent Luby these articles:

Tone Production for Beginning Saxophonists & Clarinetists
Beginner&#39;s Corner 3 and 4 (dealing with embouchure)
Soprano Saxophone Intonation
Curved vs Straight (soprano saxophones)

and a mouthpiece tuning pitch midi for soprano saxophone.

These are the same articles I have had out for some years now, and that many players have found useful for solving just the problems he describes here.
