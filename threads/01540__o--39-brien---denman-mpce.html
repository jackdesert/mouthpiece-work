I played an O&#39;Brien 5 for awhile back in the 1960s. When I chipped 
the tip, I replaced it with an O&#39;Brien 3, which I still play 
occasionally and which has a tip of ~1.08mm (0.042").

BTW, your mpce may have been modified, and not necessarily for the 
better. I say that because of your remark about the baffle and rails, 
and because my O&#39;Brien 5 was something like 1.20mm (0.047") or 1.25mm 
(0.049") at the tip, rather than the 1.41 mm (0.056")which you 
measured. 
 
If the mpce is a Denman modification of an O&#39;Brien, then the 1.41mm 
tip with an 18.5mm length may be the original specs, which would make 
it a so-called "jazz" type mpce which would require a soft reed and 
would be somewhat difficult to control. I cannot say for sure because 
I have no experience with nor knowledge of the Denman facings.

You might want to ship the mpce to a good refacer, such as the 
proprietor of this board, for an analysis and recommendations. Those 
old O&#39;Brien crystals play quite nicely when properly adjusted. 

Note that some refacers will not work on crystal mpces, because while 
working the table, side rails and tip rail is straightforward, 
reshaping the baffle can be a nightmare.

Note that in order to sound like Pete Fountain, in addition to the 
glass mpce you will then need to buy a Leblanc clarinet, grow a 
goatee and eat spicy Cajun food!

frymorgan --

I played an O&#39;Brien 5 for awhile back in the 1960s. When I chipped 
the tip, I replaced it with an O&#39;Brien 3, which I still play 
occasionally and which has a tip of ~1.08mm (0.042").

BTW, your mpce may have been modified, and not necessarily for the 
better. I say that because of your remark about the baffle and rails, 
and because my O&#39;Brien 5 was something like 1.20mm (0.047") or 1.25mm 
(0.049") at the tip, rather than the 1.41 mm (0.056")which you 
measured. 

If the mpce is a Denman modification of an O&#39;Brien, then the 1.41mm 
tip with an 18.5mm length may be the original specs, which would make 
it a so-called "jazz" type mpce which would require a soft reed and 
would be somewhat difficult to control. I cannot say for sure because 
I have no experience with nor knowledge of the Denman facings.

You might want to ship the mpce to a good refacer, such as the 
proprietor of this board, for an analysis and recommendations. Those
