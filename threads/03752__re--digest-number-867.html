            <pre class='message__body'>Hmmm ... facing .

. I would think that the ideal facing could be laser cut quite easily
since I believe the ideal facing would be a perfect ARC.

Or are flat spots along the facing desirable? .. for better bass or
altissimo response?

my calculations  ..Sax facing 25mm. 2.5mm opening -- radius of 198mm

any further questions?

            <pre class='message__body'>Laser Cut Guardalas have very good facing curves, but I can still measure
areas (bumps and flats) that I can correct by hand on most of them.  I do
not know if they are indeed laser cut, but they probably are.  Their box
says they are hand finished but they are not according to Jeff Powell of
Guardala.

A well-implemented radial arc curve is tough to beat on sax.  Flat spots
can add edge to the tone but also add some resistance (poorer response).  A
little more curve near the tip can help altissimo.
