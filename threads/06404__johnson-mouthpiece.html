            <pre class='message__body'>I play in a community band.  I heard the 1st chair player speaking about 
a Johnson mouthpiece.  I have never heard of this as being something 
that clarinet players use.  Do any of you have any experience with this 
kind of brand of mouthpiece?

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I have one for alto, although (according to the ebay seller) it had been
refaced. I'm currently using it to play shows - it's a dark sound, round
chamber, nearly no baffle. Says "Johnston-Selmer" "New York" in script.
