I was wondering what is a safe, non-toxic, non-abrasive for cleaning a metal
mouthpiece. I find that since the platting is absent(or less) that right
away(one or two days) I get some type or oxidation or tarnish or something
on the table and rails. Just plain water is not working for some reason.
When the table and rails are very clean the reeds and mouthpiece play much
better. I was thinking maybe 0000-Steel Wool to try to polish or finish it.
Or maybe Flitz but, I&#39;m sure if is non-toxic. I wish I could find my pink
lacquer polishing cloth. What are some good but safe options?

Thanks so much,
Early

            <pre class='message__body'>For cleaning (and not polishing) a mouthpiece (metal or rubber)

I use plain vinegar.  I have an old medicine container which one can put a mpc into.  I let it sit for about 10 minutes or so.  Then an  old toothbrush & 1/2 round bristle brush to clean the bore.

I&#39;ve seen vinegar used all the time for coffee pots and tried it on mpcs and seems to do a really good job of getting all the encrusted stuff off.  You may have to do it a couple of times though.

On really, really tough spot on the outside of the mpc I use a razor blade and carefully scrap it off being careful not to take off plating/rubber.  I then polish either by hand (with plastic polish for rubber and white jewelers rouge for metal) or a quick touch polish on the buffer.

afterwards I put the mpc in a medicine container full of mouthwash to sanitize for a few minutes.  Then wash off with water.
