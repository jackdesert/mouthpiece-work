An interesting item came to the shop in the way of a Langenus duckbill clarinet mouthpiece. It is a fine player with a nice round, dark tone.  What is curious about this mouthpiece is that it is aftermarket stamped T.W.H. 1010.  It was speculated that the mouthpiece was rebored.  Which appears possibly to be another method of chamber enlargement. It tunes well only with 3 1/2 or harder reeds.  Would any of the clarinet mouthpiece experts care to explain this process or further discuss this technique?

clarinet, it would better tune with opening the bore equally throughout. For
pitch problems, basically, boring the inner part of the mouthpiece bore lowers

I suspect that TWH stands for T W Howarth.  Howarth are a major manufacturer of oboes used world wide but also have a large retail store  and repair workshop in London where they sell all woodwinds (except possibly flutes).
I know that the Howarth workshop does possess the neccesary reamers for this task.
The 1010 will refer to the B&H large bore instrument that requires a specific mouthpiece bore (essentially completely parallel throughout) to tune optimally.

Howarth does make professional-level clarinets, priced at the same level as a Buffet R13.  I&#39;ve played a few and liked them, though most professionals say they&#39;re not quite at the level of equivalent models from other makers.

Ken,
I understand that Howarth have now ceased clarinet manufacture.
I have handled several of their clarinets over recent years and they were very well made, better in most respects to any Buffet etc, and they introduced several innovative features.
Unfortunately they never really broke into the professional market which is key to getting the amateurs to buy (follow my leader etc.)

Most professionals I met who tried them were not persuaded to move.

Their clarinets were essentially handmade so they could not compete on price with Buffet and the other mass makers

The oboe world is quite different, with no mass makers of quality instruments and Howarth can sell their intermediate oboes for equivalent price of an R13 and their professional ones nearly double 
the price of a Tosca.

Incidentally 15-20 or more years back Howarth also tried to enter the Bassoon market but since this was virtually a 100% handmade operation they again had to abandon this venture after only a few years.
