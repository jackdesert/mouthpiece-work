            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------The apparent logic behind the chamber design is a vortex, presuming that the
human airstream will emulate a high velocity swirl. Maybe the hulk can achieve
that kind of windpower. The average human can blow with 10 to 15 pounds of
pressure. It has been my experience that any irregularities in a chamber other
than smooth will create turbulence which is an impediment to fast airflow.

            <pre class='message__body'>The idea that one can create a vortex of blown air inside the mouthpiece is no more flawed than believing that there is a blown airstream or air flow of the slightest significance past the first 3/8" - 1/2" of the reed&#39;s tip.  A mouthpiece is not a wind tunnel for blown air traveling at what.....20m/sec (if that)?  It is a waveguide for a sound wave traveling at 345m/sec- the speed of sound.  That is how fast the reed is moving.  If you think that your glacially paced, blown air is somehow pushing the sound wave, think again. The reed is doing all the work.  Blown air simply creates a semi-constant air pressure at the reed tip which combines with the mouthpiece&#39;s ever changing, internal sound wave air pressure, and that +/- combination moves the tip of the reed - and all at the speed of sound.

      The apparent logic behind the chamber design is a vortex, presuming that the human airstream will emulate a high velocity swirl.  Maybe the hulk can achieve that kind of windpower.  The average human can blow with 10 to 15 pounds of pressure. 
 
It has been my experience that any irregularities in a chamber other than smooth will create turbulence which is an impediment to fast airflow.

Blown air simply creates a semi-constant air pressure at the reed tip which combines with the mouthpiece&#39;s ever changing, internal sound wave air pressure, and that +/- combination moves the tip of the reed - and all at the speed of sound.

I suspect that TWH stands for T W Howarth.  Howarth are a major manufacturer of oboes used world wide but also have a large retail store  and repair workshop in London where they sell all woodwinds (except possibly flutes).
I know that the Howarth workshop does possess the neccesary reamers for this task.
The 1010 will refer to the B&H large bore instrument that requires a specific mouthpiece bore (essentially completely parallel throughout) to tune optimally.

Howarth does make professional-level clarinets, priced at the same level as a Buffet R13.  I&#39;ve played a few and liked them, though most professionals say they&#39;re not quite at the level of equivalent models from other makers.

Ken,
I understand that Howarth have now ceased clarinet manufacture.
I have handled several of their clarinets over recent years and they were very well made, better in most respects to any Buffet etc, and they introduced several innovative features.
Unfortunately they never really broke into the professional market which is key to getting the amateurs to buy (follow my leader etc.)

Most professionals I met who tried them were not persuaded to move.

Their clarinets were essentially handmade so they could not compete on price with Buffet and the other mass makers

The oboe world is quite different, with no mass makers of quality instruments and Howarth can sell their intermediate oboes for equivalent price of an R13 and their professional ones nearly double 
the price of a Tosca.

Incidentally 15-20 or more years back Howarth also tried to enter the Bassoon market but since this was virtually a 100% handmade operation they again had to abandon this venture after only a few years.
 
Norman
