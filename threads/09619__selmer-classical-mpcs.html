I find that leaving the hump in the roll over controls a lot of the resistance. If I flatten the baffle out, the piece , the piece becomes as free as a bird.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you can not compensate to your liking by using a harder reed, then there are 
several things you can try adjusting.   A more open tip, shorter facing and/or a 
moderate or highly elliptical facing curve would all make it harder to blow 
which most players find more resistant. You could also try facing that are not 
in the family of radial or elliptical curves.   Some gradual bumps in the facing 
curve can add good resistance.  


For the needs of "classical" playing, I would suggest highly elliptical.  Like 
an aspect ratio of 7 to 12.  You can keep the tip opening small and you do not 
have to go short with the facing curve which would hurt low note response IMO.

An asymetrial facing would be a more conventional method for adding resistance to the response of your Selmer mouthpiece. It will look better also.

Keith would you please elaborate about what you mean by an aspect ratio of 7 to 12?  THANKS

            <pre class='message__body'>The aspect ration I was referring to is a/b where "a" is the length of the major 
axis and "b" is the length of the minor axis of the ellipse used as a target

area of my site, this illustrates the concept.  When a=b the ratio is "1" which 
is a radial facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah, a faceted bumpy facing is resistant (bad resistant) and looks bad.  But a 
gradual bump like I&#39;m thinking of can not be seen.  Actually most facing curves

Assymmetrical facings -

How many times has this happened to you?

You go through an entire box, or two, or three boxes of reeds, and can only find ONE reed out of all of them that plays.

That is because your old Linus Fontleroy mouthpiece&#39;s facing is as crooked as a Washington, DC politician.  You have managed to find the one reed that is cut as crookedly, and just happens to workk with that facing.

I&#39;m not a fan of assymmetrical facings, or "bumps" in the facing.  I&#39;ve evened the rails, or smoothed the facing curve of too many mouthpieces with excellent results for the players to think a crooked facing is better.

Resistance my be added by increasing the angle of the baffle just behind the tip rail (filing away material) or using a reed of the correct cut and strength for the mouthpiece.

A big mistake is to try out a new mouthpiece and limit yourself to your current reeds.  "I always play a Lavoz medium hard."  Well, maybe you do, but your mouthpiece would like a different grade of gasoline to run smoothly.

Well, that&#39;s all I have to say about that subject.  ;-)

I'm going to go with keeping the small tip on these pieces and using as high
an elliptical ratio as the existing facing curve will allow.

            <pre class='message__body'>About the Selmer classical pieces being too free blowing - I&#39;m not sure what type of reed you&#39;ve been trying with your Selmer classical pieces, but as stated above, if you&#39;re not playing a classical-cut and class-strength reed on a Selmer classical piece, be it an S80 C* (the most popular nowadays), a Rousseau Classic 4R, or something similar, chances are it will feel this way. For example, even if you take a reed like a LaVoz med-hard or a Rico Select Jazz 3M that normally feels just-right on your Meyer #7 for alto and then put it on a classical piece, chances are it&#39;ll feel really strange and will not work well at all. Among other things, I&#39;ve usually felt like it&#39;s too free-blwoing and you can&#39;t seem to get a nice core sound that way. 

For classical, I&#39;ve found that either the Rico Grand Concert Select or the Vandoren Blue (or Purple, same thing) box reeds work well for a classical mouthpiece, and are totally different than jazz reeds. Usually a 3 1/2 will do it for me if memory serves, it&#39;s been a long time. But that&#39;s the size I&#39;d shoot for.

Same thing applies to a jazz mouthpiece. If you put Vandoren blue-box or Rico Grand Concert Select 3 1/2&#39;s on your Meyer #7 alto mouthpiece, it most likely isn&#39;t going to feel near the same as a good jazz reed in the same 3 1/2 size will feel on that mouthpiece. That&#39;s not to say it can&#39;t be done - my friend Keith Anderson who plays sometimes in trumpeter Roy Hargrove&#39;s band must have some really naturally strong wind and embouchure muscles, because at one time he was playing a Link on his tenor with a very large tip opening (I wanna say at least a 10) with Vandoren blue-box reeds and he was sounding great on it, and it sounded totally natural when he played it. He let me try that tenor set-up of his once a few years ago, and I could barely, barely produce a fizzle of a sound on it haha. I guess everyone&#39;s just built so different, that certain things work best for certain folks. For me, I usually don&#39;t feel comfortable on anything more than medium-hard reeds on a medium tip opening, but for a lot of people this would feel way too soft I guess. 

One kind of sad thing about that mouthpiece of Keith&#39;s - it was actually originally one of Stanley Turrentine&#39;s mouthpieces that he gave to Keith, and the other day Keith was playing a gig and afterward some other guys at the venue he was playing at were getting into a scuffle. He was leaving in a hurry because it looked like the scene with these guys was getting a little more rough, and on the way to his car his mouthpiece bag fell out of his case and he lost a few mouthpieces including that one! When he called the venue back to see if someone had picked up the mouthpiece bag inside, they said they didn&#39;t have it. I haven&#39;t spoken to him in a while so maybe he found it, but if not, it&#39;s a major bummer. So, I&#39;ll try to keep in mind for the future, Step 1 of Mouthpiece Work: Don&#39;t lose the mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Woops... Meant to say *classical strength reed* in that first paragraph, not *class-strength which doesn&#39;t make any sense... Sorry.

> About the Selmer classical pieces being too free blowing - I&#39;m not sure what type of reed you&#39;ve been trying with your Selmer classical pieces, but as stated above, if you&#39;re not playing a classical-cut and class-strength reed on a Selmer classical piece, be it an S80 C* (the most popular nowadays), a Rousseau Classic 4R, or something similar, chances are it will feel this way. For example, even if you take a reed like a LaVoz med-hard or a Rico Select Jazz 3M that normally feels just-right on your Meyer #7 for alto and then put it on a classical piece, chances are it&#39;ll feel really strange and will not work well at all. Among other things, I&#39;ve usually felt like it&#39;s too free-blwoing and you can&#39;t seem to get a nice core sound that way.

Usually a 3 1/2 will do it for me if memory serves, it&#39;s been a long time. But that&#39;s the size I&#39;d shoot for.

> Same thing applies to a jazz mouthpiece. If you put Vandoren blue-box or Rico Grand Concert Select 3 1/2&#39;s on your Meyer #7 alto mouthpiece, it most likely isn&#39;t going to feel near the same as a good jazz reed in the same 3 1/2 size will feel on that mouthpiece. That&#39;s not to say it can&#39;t be done - my friend Keith Anderson who plays sometimes in trumpeter Roy Hargrove&#39;s band must have some really naturally strong wind and embouchure muscles, because at one time he was playing a Link on his tenor with a very large tip opening (I wanna say at least a 10) with Vandoren blue-box reeds and he was sounding great on it, and it sounded totally natural when he played it. He let me try that tenor set-up of his once a few years ago, and I could barely, barely produce a fizzle of a sound on it haha. I guess everyone&#39;s just built so different, that certain things work best for certain folks. For me, I usually don&#39;t feel comfortable on anything more than medium-hard reeds on a medium tip opening, but for a lot of people this would feel way too soft I guess.

> One kind of sad thing about that mouthpiece of Keith&#39;s - it was actually originally one of Stanley Turrentine&#39;s mouthpieces that he gave to Keith, and the other day Keith was playing a gig and afterward some other guys at the venue he was playing at were getting into a scuffle. He was leaving in a hurry because it looked like the scene with these guys was getting a little more rough, and on the way to his car his mouthpiece bag fell out of his case and he lost a few mouthpieces including that one! When he called the venue back to see if someone had picked up the mouthpiece bag inside, they said they didn&#39;t have it. I haven&#39;t spoken to him in a while so maybe he found it, but if not, it&#39;s a major bummer. So, I&#39;ll try to keep in mind for the future, Step 1 of Mouthpiece Work: Don&#39;t lose the mouthpiece.
