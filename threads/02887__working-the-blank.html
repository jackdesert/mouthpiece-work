I&#39;ve been slowly but surely working on one of my two blanks. Since I don&#39;t 
own a rotary tool and have been doing all the baffle work by hand file it 
takes a long time. I forced one of the blanks onto my horn before I started 
and it played (badly) from about E1 through C3. The notes above and below 
this range were virtually impossible to play.

I&#39;m just about through opening the throat and chamber to about what I think 
I want and will begin facing it soon. I&#39;m shooting for about a .105 tip 
opening.

I had a similar playing experiance on the blank.

I think it would be entertaining to see who could create the best 
sounding recording using the raw tenor blank.  With a softer reed and 
a little more practice, I think I could sound passable on it.  Who 
needs all this fancy reworking?  ;-)
