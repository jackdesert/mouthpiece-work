I&#39;m not a fan of seal testing, but this is a cool video of one:

Yes a cool video for sure. The test lasted three seconds but the video
much longer to promote the mouthpice presumably and what is the
significance of the specified Marca Jazz #3 reed ?  :)
  The test wasn&#39;t very convincing somehow. I would have thought that
the tester should have used a conventional blowing embouchure, while
sucking. 
 The video clearly indicates a loose lollipop, all enveloping
embouchure which would not expose uneven rails, which I understand is
the reason for carrying out the test.

I think softer reeds do better on the seal test.  Harder worse.

I do not think it matters hows the vacuum is established.  If there is 
a low or high spot on the rails, it air will leak there.

Gradually uneven rails and twisted facings can still do well on the 
seal test with a soft reed.  Facings that are flat near the tip do 
better than arced.  Heck, a totally straight facing with a tip opening 
of .000" does great!

Call me a sceptic but I fail to see how air can be drawn over a faulty
facing/reed gap/hump if the lips are covering this fault the way A.S.
seems to be sucking in the video. 
The suction has to be on the tip side of the fault,for any air to be
drawn in. 
For any meaningful result, the suction test would have to be applied
to different facing positions, progressivly withdrawing the lips
towards the tip, to find the position of a leak, if any.  
A hard reed will prevent the reed closing and masking the fault.
It all sounds a bit iffy to me.

After my previous ramblings, I now see the reason for the twelve
second delay on the video. The reed actually opened eventually. Cute!
      I tried the test on a Lawton 100 tenor MPC with a Larsen #2
reed. The rails are even, according to my gauge.
      I could not get it to work. Perhaps a very soft reed is
required ?

            <pre class='message__body'>It seems to me that the seal test would only show up irregularities that were small enough that the elasticity of the reed would not be able to compensate for them. Big irregularities, such as uneven (but smooth) side rails, might not show up.
