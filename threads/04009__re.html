The theory on this is that it allows the tip of the reed to close on the facing
all at once, rather than from the corners to the middle, if the curve continues
all the way through the tip rail area.  It was felt that this gave a quicker, easier
response.  Paul Coats

"Flat spot" at the tip of a mouthpiece facing 
I have been a member of this group for quite some time but I have not posted until
I took some time to read the extensive list of previous posts. 
I have watched several great refacers work on my mouthpieces. These people include
Ben Harrod (Otto Link Pompano Beach), Wolfie Tannebaum (Wolfe Tayne, Guy Hawkins
and BARI), Bobby Dukoff, Ralph Morgan, Bennie Bonacio, and Frank Wells. To a greater
or lesser extent, these refacers and manufacturers use a flat spot near the tip
of their facing curves. I have not seen this tendency discussed to any great extent
here. 
The Erick Brand refacing manual mentions that many good mouthpiece facings are nearly
flat from the tip back to the first or even second feeler gauge. Frank Wells, famous
for his work for John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Bobby Mintzer Mike Smith and too many
others to mention here, was a serious exponent of this technique. Frank would finish
his facing curve with a SIDEWAYS sweep of the tip across his sandpaper. The angle
of the mouthpiece, of course, would determine the length of this "flat spot." 
From the experienced refacers here, what is your experience with this technique?
What results does it yield for you? What part of the range of the instrument is
most affected? How do you go about producing your tip curve. Please - I&#39;m looking
for empirical results, not armchair theory.
