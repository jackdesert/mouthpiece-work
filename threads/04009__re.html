"Flat spot" at the tip of a mouthpiece facing 
I have been a member of this group for quite some time but I have not posted until
I took some time to read the extensive list of previous posts. 
I have watched several great refacers work on my mouthpieces. These people include
Ben Harrod (Otto Link Pompano Beach), Wolfie Tannebaum (Wolfe Tayne, Guy Hawkins
and BARI), Bobby Dukoff, Ralph Morgan, Bennie Bonacio, and Frank Wells. To a greater
or lesser extent, these refacers and manufacturers use a flat spot near the tip
of their facing curves. I have not seen this tendency discussed to any great extent
here. 
The Erick Brand refacing manual mentions that many good mouthpiece facings are nearly
flat from the tip back to the first or even second feeler gauge. Frank Wells, famous
for his work for John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Bobby Mintzer Mike Smith and too many
others to mention here, was a serious exponent of this technique. Frank would finish
his facing curve with a SIDEWAYS sweep of the tip across his sandpaper. The angle
of the mouthpiece, of course, would determine the length of this "flat spot." 
From the experienced refacers here, what is your experience with this technique?
What results does it yield for you? What part of the range of the instrument is
most affected? How do you go about producing your tip curve. Please - I&#39;m looking
for empirical results, not armchair theory.

            <pre class='message__body'>So, the $64,000 question is: what is the length, relative to facing 
length, of the flat spot?  I suspect this is a trial and error thing.
