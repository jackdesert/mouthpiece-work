            <pre class='message__body'>I think you need to be able to measure the same mouthpiece a few times and get the same results within reason.  You will need to experiment some to get a feel for how significant a small change in the facing curve is to you when you play it.  If one number change in a reading feels significant, you need to also be able to gauge the same measurement several times with less than 1 number variation in your readings.  Ideally less than .25 number variation. 

 If your repeated readings vary by 1 number how are you going to correct a 1 number problem?  Did you just fix it or did it vary because of the limitations of your gauging skills?

            <pre class='message__body'>Mouthpiece refacing is not a science, it is an art. 

 

You can get perfect answers to all the information you are asking and for the many new questions that will crop up. Then sit down and make perfectly awful mouthpieces. In photography, they say you must take 10,000 photographs before you will get a worthwhile piece of art, The same goes for refacing mouthpieces. If you are afraid of damaging mouthpieces, just count that as part of the cost of your education. If you are afraid of making a bad mouthpiece, I can absolutely guarantee your first mouthpieces will not be good. I have been refacing off and on for over fifty years and have made a few really good mouthpieces, but just recently I have made a few spectacular ones. I don’t do commercial work, but enjoy the process and give them to students and friends. I enjoy fussing with mouthpieces. They are a mystery awaiting to be discovered.

 

The questions you are asking will not make you a good refacer. That may only arrive when you have made a hundred or more. Experience will answer most questions better than answers from others.

 

Why not reface ten, try them, and come back and give us your impressions of the experience? You may decide it is not refacing that is a pleasant pastime for you.

I also understand what you mean by "learning by doing". 

 

 

I have measured tons of mouthpieces already but I still have some questions and or clarifications when I am measuring.

            <pre class='message__body'>I wish you luck but I do not know of anyone who has been successful in refacing that has asked for as much basic guidance as you are asking for.

Successful refacers are usually good at other fix-it jobs.  They can repair household items, they can work on cars, they do wood and metal working, they can trouble-shoot problems and decide if they should tackle the job themselves or hire a professional to do the work.  As described in a Dilbert cartoon, they have "the knack".  

They look to the web for clues on difficult tasks.  But more often they design their own tests, analyze their own results, makes changes and move forward.   They apply math and science if they can and/or they do a lot of experiments (trial and error) to make improvements. 

This good is an amazing resource of information.  But it is not a substitute for basic personal skills needed to be successful.

Oh ok ok...

 

 

I can see your point a bit now.

 

 

I just want to clarify. Say I have measured 20 mouthpieces already and in these pieces I found 7 good measurements in different facing numbers. The rest (which is 13) are bad ones. 

 

Does this mean that I can immediately proceed to reworking/refacing these bad mouthpieces already even if I just have these 7 good measurements that will serve as my targets for the bad ones?

 

I haven&#39;t tried to proceed on reworking/refacing process because someone told me that before one should proceed on reworking some pieces, he/she must measure 40 mouthpieces at least or else the mouthpieces will be ruined.

Do you mean the good ones are the one that I will reface or the measurements of the good ones will be my target for the bad ones that I should reface?
