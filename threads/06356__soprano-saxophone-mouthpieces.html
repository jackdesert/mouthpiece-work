            <pre class='message__body'>I am a clarinetist and I am wanting to know the best mouthpiece for 
soprano saxophone.  I know this is highly subjective but I&#39;m asking for 
my needs based on the information I&#39;m about to give.  I played on a 
soprano saxophone in 1992 at a music convention.  What I liked about the 
mouthpiece I played on was that I could articulate very well.

I have a Pyne "S" series mouthpiece for my Bb Clarinet and a Vandoren 
5RV for my Eb Clarinet.  Based on what I&#39;ve just told you, what is the 
best mouthpiece for me for sorpano saxophone.  I don&#39;t know wanting to 
pay more than $55 for a mouthpiece for soprano saxophone.  I&#39;m not an 
entertainer so I wouldn&#39;t need a special jazz mouthpiece for special 
effects.

Looking forward to hearing from you all.

for you. My best regards,

            <pre class='message__body'>I presume Bro. Jackson doesn&#39;t recall the mouthpiece that articulated very
well, unfortunately.

The Graftonite Rico mouthpieces were around $16 last time I looked. Quite
inexpensive.  They are black, and are available in 3 different chamber sizes
and 3 or 4 different facings.  I have no idea how they compare to the
clarinet mouthpieces mentioned, though.

The gray Rico pieces were the so-called "Metallite", which were pieces with
a high baffle and more edge to the tone - and they have not been off the
market for a few years now.

            <pre class='message__body'>My experience with the Ricos... The Graftonite is the black, the Metalite is the silver-gray.  The Graftonite had a too large chamber which resulted in poor octave to octave intonation on every soprano I tried them on.  The Metalite was a high baffle version, and while slightly better, was also problematic as far as intonation.  
   
  The  BARI Associates mouthpiece is moderately priced.  Sometimes you can find a Bundy, which is a surprisingly good mouthpiece.  With the Bundy, get the #4 facing.
   
  The Runyon Custom is about $65 or so.  In that model I would suggest the #6 facing for you.  The Custom was played by Grover Washington, Jr, and is played by Ernie Watts.  A good all around mouthpiece.  Good projection without being edgy.  Good intonation.  While the mouthpiece looks small, the chamber is of medium size. I&#39;ve suggested the Custom #6 with 2-2 1/2 Fibracell reed to many players just starting soprano sax, and they have been successful.  Later you may go on to other mouthpieces, but this is a good workable setup.
   
  You do not want too close tip opening.  Soprano sax is not the same as clarinet.  Soprano sax requires a somewhat larger facing and softer reed as compared to clarinet.  A tip opening typical of clarinet, .039"-.045", would be considered very close for soprano sax.  A soprano medium facing would be .050"-.055".  I think you would find  most soprano sax players using .060"-.065", and some players larger than that.

I am a clarinetist and I am wanting to know the best mouthpiece for soprano saxophone.  I know this is highly subjective but I&#39;m asking for my needs based on the information I&#39;m about to give.  I played on a soprano saxophone in 1992 at a music convention.  What I liked about the mouthpiece I played on was that I could articulate very well.

I have a Pyne "S" series mouthpiece for my Bb Clarinet and a Vandoren 5RV for my Eb Clarinet.  Based on what I&#39;ve just told you, what is the best mouthpiece for me for sorpano saxophone.  I don&#39;t know wanting to pay more than $55 for a mouthpiece for soprano saxophone.  I&#39;m not an entertainer so I wouldn&#39;t need a special jazz mouthpiece for special effects.

            <pre class='message__body'>I want to echo Paul&#39;s comments about the Runyon Custom. I&#39;ve used one for
many years (refaced by Paul) with great results. I own about twenty
different soprano mouthpieces, but always seem to go back to the Custom.
