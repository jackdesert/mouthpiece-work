            <pre class='message__body'>I presume Bro. Jackson doesn&#39;t recall the mouthpiece that articulated very
well, unfortunately.

The Graftonite Rico mouthpieces were around $16 last time I looked. Quite
inexpensive.  They are black, and are available in 3 different chamber sizes
and 3 or 4 different facings.  I have no idea how they compare to the
clarinet mouthpieces mentioned, though.

The gray Rico pieces were the so-called "Metallite", which were pieces with
a high baffle and more edge to the tone - and they have not been off the
market for a few years now.

            <pre class='message__body'>My experience with the Ricos... The Graftonite is the black, the Metalite is the silver-gray.  The Graftonite had a too large chamber which resulted in poor octave to octave intonation on every soprano I tried them on.  The Metalite was a high baffle version, and while slightly better, was also problematic as far as intonation.  
   
  The  BARI Associates mouthpiece is moderately priced.  Sometimes you can find a Bundy, which is a surprisingly good mouthpiece.  With the Bundy, get the #4 facing.
   
  The Runyon Custom is about $65 or so.  In that model I would suggest the #6 facing for you.  The Custom was played by Grover Washington, Jr, and is played by Ernie Watts.  A good all around mouthpiece.  Good projection without being edgy.  Good intonation.  While the mouthpiece looks small, the chamber is of medium size. I&#39;ve suggested the Custom #6 with 2-2 1/2 Fibracell reed to many players just starting soprano sax, and they have been successful.  Later you may go on to other mouthpieces, but this is a good workable setup.
   
  You do not want too close tip opening.  Soprano sax is not the same as clarinet.  Soprano sax requires a somewhat larger facing and softer reed as compared to clarinet.  A tip opening typical of clarinet, .039"-.045", would be considered very close for soprano sax.  A soprano medium facing would be .050"-.055".  I think you would find  most soprano sax players using .060"-.065", and some players larger than that.

I am a clarinetist and I am wanting to know the best mouthpiece for soprano saxophone.  I know this is highly subjective but I&#39;m asking for my needs based on the information I&#39;m about to give.  I played on a soprano saxophone in 1992 at a music convention.  What I liked about the mouthpiece I played on was that I could articulate very well.

I have a Pyne "S" series mouthpiece for my Bb Clarinet and a Vandoren 5RV for my Eb Clarinet.  Based on what I&#39;ve just told you, what is the best mouthpiece for me for sorpano saxophone.  I don&#39;t know wanting to pay more than $55 for a mouthpiece for soprano saxophone.  I&#39;m not an entertainer so I wouldn&#39;t need a special jazz mouthpiece for special effects.

Looking forward to hearing from you all.

My experience with the Ricos... The Graftonite is the black, the Metalite is
the silver-gray.  The Graftonite had a too large chamber which resulted in
poor octave to octave intonation on every soprano I tried them on.  The
Metalite was a high baffle version, and while slightly better, was also
problematic as far as intonation.  
 
The  BARI Associates mouthpiece is moderately priced.  Sometimes you can
find a Bundy, which is a surprisingly good mouthpiece.  With the Bundy, get

The Runyon Custom is about $65 or so.  In that model I would suggest the #6
facing for you.  The Custom was played by Grover Washington, Jr, and is
played by Ernie Watts.  A good all around mouthpiece.  Good projection
without being edgy.  Good intonation.  While the mouthpiece looks small, the
chamber is of medium size. I&#39;ve suggested the Custom #6 with 2-2 1/2
Fibracell reed to many players just starting soprano sax, and they have been

workable setup.
 
You do not want too close tip opening.  Soprano sax is not the same as

compared to clarinet.  A tip opening typical of clarinet, .039"-.045", would
be considered very close for soprano sax.  A soprano medium facing would be
.050"-.055".  I think you would find  most soprano sax players using
.060"-.065", and some players larger than that.
