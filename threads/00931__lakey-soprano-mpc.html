            <pre class='message__body'>Hello to all,
Recently I have got a soprano hard rubber Lakey 6*. It was "wasted" with sandpaper (diagonal strokes): it has the table not flat, one  rail higher than the other and tip opening = 44".
I know tip opening for Lakey 6*  is 75", but I would reface this piece with a smaller tip opening to remove less material from it (I think this way is more easy for my skills). 
Has someone measurament for sop Lakey 5* ? 
Any other suggestions are welcome.
thanks in advance
ciao a tutti, Filippo

ciao keith
I have a mm glass gage (JJ Babbitt)
I have feelers in mm: I use 0,04  0,25  0,35  0,50  0,60  0,80  1,20  1,60  1,95  (I also have 0,10   0,15    0,20  0,30  0,40  0,45  0,70 0,90).
If you give me measurement with your gages I could plot the curve with your spreadsheet (great!!) and then I could use my gages.
thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>> If you give me measurement with your gages I could plot the curve

Try this .063" tip, since you are at .044" now.

Feeler  Glass Gage
[inch]  [mm*2]
0.0015	38.00
0.0050	32.50
0.0095	28.00
0.0165	22.50
0.0245	17.75
0.0330	13.50
0.0485	7.00

0.0630 tip inside a .030" wide tip rail

If you want a wider opening, or need help in converting the numbers, 
let me know.

I do try to read my glass gage to the nearest 1/4 number, even though 
the scale is marked in increments of 2.  It is splitting hairs, but 
it helps me get good results.

Keith, Thanks for you measurements (Sorry, I have read your message only now).
This night I&#39;ll convert the numbers and I&#39;ll try to reface mpc.
thanks ciao
