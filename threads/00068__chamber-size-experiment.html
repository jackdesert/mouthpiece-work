            <pre class='message__body'>In the Ernest Ferron book, The Saxophone is My Voice (avail from
www.flutesmith.com), he states that the mouthpiece chamber volume, to
play in tune, is equal to the missing cone section of the end of the
neckpipe.  He goes on to state that a "large chamber" piece is pushed on
farther, a small "chamber piece" is pulled out more... but the volume of
the mouthpiece beyond the end of the neckpipe will be the same.

Well, this is true of the tuning note... but you still have LENGTH to
contend with.  What happens, if your tuning note is correct, a large
chamber mouthpiece that is pushed on very far, will play sharp in the
palm keys in the upper register.  A small chamber mouthpiece that is
pulled out very far will play flat in the palm keys in the upper
register.

I had seen this with our bass sax, a huge cavernous mouthpiece bass
mouthpiece, you had to push past the cork.  Palm keys very sharp.  But
with a suitably modified bari piece (lengthened facing) the palm keys
were very well in tune.  The mouthpiece was in a more normal placement
on the cork.

I had a huge pitch problem with a Selmer S80 on a soprano, yet no
problem with a Runyon Custom.  With another mouthpiece I had the
opposite problem... let me describe, but first a little background:

Before my experience with the bass, and reading the Ferron book...

At first I figured I needed more chamber volume... using a 1/2" bit, I
drilled the bore forward a little toward the tip.  But this made the
mouthpiece flat when placed at it the previous position on the cork.  I
pushed in to get good tuning.  Now the palm keys were even MORE sharp!

So, back to the little soprano experiment.  I used the 1/2" dia drill
bit, and drilled from the bore into the throat, extending the bore up to
the window.  Now the mouthpiece resembled many metal mouthpieces, with
the appearance of a high baffle.  (So, is a baffle really high or is the
bore really big?)

I made some tubes with Delrin rod stock.  I started with 1/2" dia rod
stock, and drilled into it, making sure to center perfectly as I could,
with a 3/8" bit.  3/8" being the approximate dia of the opening into the
neckpipe.

Next I cut various lengths of this tubing, and inserted them into the
mouthpiece, pushing up to the back of the baffle.  Hey!  It is now a
round chamber mouthpiece!  So, by varying the length of tubing, I varied
the "chamber volume" or the ratio of volume to length.

Soon, I found the length that gave both a good tuning pitch AND played
in tune in the palm keys.

Using no tubing, or too short a tubing, gave sharp palm keys.

Using too long tubing gave flat palm keys.

Remember, anything past the end of the mouthpiece IS chamber volume...
even if it is formed as part of the bore.
