==Just found this, too, regarding
CarGo Chemicals; QuikSteel Epoxy Putty & Paste:

"8. Is QUIKSTEEL EPOXY PUTTY safe to use on drinking water pipes and
holding tanks? Yes. QUIKSTEEL EPOXY PUTTY is certified safe by NSF
International for use on drinking water pipes, holding tanks, and all
drinking water systems. QUIKSTEEL is nontoxic."

For the full text, goto: http://www.cargochemical.com/prodques.htm

This doesn&#39;t really answer the question of whether it is safe to use 
orally. IMHO, I would feel comfortable using it for a baffle (no 
direct contact with mouth), but - like Paul - I would use a patch 
over it if I used it to repair a bite plate (just to be on the safe 
side :-).

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Paul,

You should check whether your Devcon epoxy contains alpha Bisphenol. It is a pretty nasty chemical and can cause endocrine disorders. Many, if not most, epoxies contain it.

  I use the Quiksteel Epoxy Putty for baffles, I use Devcon 5 Minute epoxy for filling teeth gouges.  It is clear, takes on the color of the material under it, for a nearly invisible repair.

     This topic came up a few months ago, and I had posted the following: 
    === 
    Just found this, too, regarding 
    CarGo Chemicals; QuikSteel Epoxy Putty & Paste: 

    "8. Is QUIKSTEEL EPOXY PUTTY safe to use on drinking water pipes and 
    holding tanks? Yes. QUIKSTEEL EPOXY PUTTY is certified safe by NSF 
    International for use on drinking water pipes, holding tanks, and all 
    drinking water systems. QUIKSTEEL is nontoxic." 

    For the full text, goto: http://www.cargochemical.com/prodques.htm 
    === 
      

    This doesn&#39;t really answer the question of whether it is safe to use 
    orally. IMHO, I would feel comfortable using it for a baffle (no 
    direct contact with mouth), but - like Paul - I would use a patch 
    over it if I used it to repair a bite plate (just to be on the safe 
    side :-).

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes. It leaches out and as an endocrine disrupter can be harmful in
concentrations of only parts per billion.  It causes most of its harm in
developing endocrine systems, so adults are not at great risk, but if
ingested before puberty it has been implicated as one of the prime suspects
in the worldwide drop in sperm count, some testicular cancers, feminization
of male genitalia and a host of other endocrine disorders. Because it is a
xeroestrogen boys are mostly at risk but since it stays in body fat and is
passed on in high concentrations in mother&#39;s milk it is pretty bad for
females too.

It&#39;s one of those things like global warming and the hole in the ozone layer
that don&#39;t do that much immediate damage but have pretty horrible long-term
effects, but unlike the other two its effects are proven. Nasty stuff,
really. There are some sites on this and other endocrine disrupters and I
will try to find a link and post it.

http://www.bisphenol-a.org/about/index.html

There are lots more--just do a browser search.

Both these official sites say that there is no problem with bisphenol-A.
There are others I have read that question these results. If you are
interested read the book "The Feminization of Nature" by Deborah Cadbury,
which documents conclusions quite different from those on these two sites.
Perhaps the Cadbury book is alarmist, or perhaps the official sites are
overly optimistic. Make up your own mind. Personally I&#39;m staying far away
from oral contact with epoxies.

Just do a search with tis string in your browser : bisphenol And endocrine

You will come up with tons of sites, many abstracts of scientific papers.
Industry has a strong reason to promote the safety of Bisphenol alpha since
its use is so widespread. Don&#39;t forget that DDT and 2,4 D were promoted for
years as wonder pesticides without adverse effects....
