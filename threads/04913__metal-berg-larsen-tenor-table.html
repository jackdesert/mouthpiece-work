By hand, just start with extra coarse sandpaper.  I think I have used 80
grit.  It still hurts.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have been using diamond stones for years & you can get a great 
finish with them.

I think you all know to do the vacuum test on a mouthpiece to see how 
well the reed is closing. In case there is someone who isn&#39;t in the 
know I plug the bore with a rubber plug, then put the reed on with a 
ligature then put enough of it in your mouth & suck so the reed 
closes up onto the mouthpiece, you should be able to take it out of 
your mouth & a few seconds later it will open with a popping sound, 
if it doesent you have a leak & have to start measuring to determine 
the position of the leak then fix it. Much quicker & more easier way 
of seeing the leak is to use a &#39;LEGERE&#39; synthetic reed 1.5 or a 2
(http://www.legere.com/) this is an opaque synthetic reed (They play 
great & last a long time)so as long as it&#39;s wet as you pull the 
mouthpiece out of your mouth & look at the reed you will clearly see 
through the reed the air being dragged in by the water bubbling at 
the site of the leak. if it is at just one point you havn&#39;t finished 
yet, if it&#39;s all the way round evenly then it&#39;s a good seat.
Hope this helps

  It is more reliable with plastic or synthetic reeds.  
   
  A mouthpiece/reed could hold a good vacuum and still not have a facing that works with the cut of the reed well.

Maybe if some great player took their mouthpiece off during a solo and
played some funky pops on it I&#39;d be more interested.

I have heard Miles Osland do just that quite effectively. The cut used
to be on his web site. 

As a player, I use the pop test when I think a reed is warped, but I
have also seen it ruin baritone reeds...

  And there is a noticiable difference in using a new reed which can leak through the pores, a seasoned reed, which is more naturally sealed, and synthetic reed, which seems to hold the best vacuum.
   
  And of course, as mentioned before, a narrow tip opening (classical) will hold longer than a wide tip opening.
   
  A simple light pass, just one stroke, of the table on 600-800 paper will reveal any low spots immediately.
