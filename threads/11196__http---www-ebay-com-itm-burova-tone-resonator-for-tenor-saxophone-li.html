It looks to be applying pressure at the heart of the reed.
Inasmuch as scraping a reed here can easily kill a reed, perhaps 
stiffening it like this is helpful. Or not.
I&#39;ll have to make one and see what it does.

            <pre class='message__body'>I made something that I think approximates this thingy, using a strip of 
soft steel bar stock about 1/4" wide and 3/32" thick, with a concavity 
ground into the underside to approximate the reed&#39;s curvature.

demonstrated at the base of the vamp. But I thought there was some

the reed, which I guess is the function of such ligs that have a metal

Bending the device more in order to properly press the base of the vamp, 
it seemed to be a somewhat brightened but smaller sound.

I didn&#39;t consider this any kind of marvelous improvement, but it may be

are all quite bright with easier top tones, this gadget may be 
redundant.  It may be more helpful with cane reeds.

A Rovner style ligature with something like this incorporated would be 
somewhat less fidgety to use.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think the idea is, your teeth/lower lip go on the metal, instead of the reed.  You then use the embouchure corners to control pitch/sound, giving you a very free blowing, open sound - the Joe Allard school.  As far as the acoustical engine is concerned, as long as the reed resonance is kept under control to avoid squeaking, the less reed damping by the lower lip, the better.

I think there are two possibilities:

1. It may be a guide for positioning your lower lip at the correct place (so that your lower teeth are exactly even with the point where the vamp and the reed separate).  However, this is just as easily (and at zero cost) by finding the correct point and marking it with a pencil.

2. More likely, it presses the reed so that you can play with no embouchure strength.  However, embouchure pressure on the reed varies constantly and is how you get the tone you want.  Thus the gizmo is for lazy beginners only and would delay the development of a real embouchure.
