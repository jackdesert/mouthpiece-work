            <pre class='message__body'>I think the idea is, your teeth/lower lip go on the metal, instead of the reed.  You then use the embouchure corners to control pitch/sound, giving you a very free blowing, open sound - the Joe Allard school.  As far as the acoustical engine is concerned, as long as the reed resonance is kept under control to avoid squeaking, the less reed damping by the lower lip, the better.

I think there are two possibilities:

1. It may be a guide for positioning your lower lip at the correct place (so that your lower teeth are exactly even with the point where the vamp and the reed separate).  However, this is just as easily (and at zero cost) by finding the correct point and marking it with a pencil.

2. More likely, it presses the reed so that you can play with no embouchure strength.  However, embouchure pressure on the reed varies constantly and is how you get the tone you want.  Thus the gizmo is for lazy beginners only and would delay the development of a real embouchure.
