Wow keith, you were not kidding about the kit at WWBW...pretty pricey 
indeed for what you get.  Talk about a profit margin! I got my entire 
kit assembled for $120.  That included the Babbit glass (takes 2 or so 
to get), Steves Tip Gauge, Jeffs very nice feelers, a large set of 
standard feelers, plate glass (donated by local glass company to get 
rid of scraps), sandpaper, steelwool, and a set of files.  Popcicle 
sticks, dowels and other items were procured from the house and shop.  
My next purchase will be some additional rotary attachments.  

Note: I hope I didnt offend anyone here by posting how they could be 
reached for various tools.
