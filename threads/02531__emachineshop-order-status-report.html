Now its 11/29 delivery.

I found one post on the web from someone who had trouble with 
delivery schedule from eMachineShop.  They ended up cacelling the 
order and going elsewhere since they need the parts in support of an 
established business.

I think our job really through them a curveball.  I half expect them 
to come back and say they can not do it for the price they gave us.  
If that happens, I&#39;ll be sure to let y&#39;all know so we can decide a 
course of action.

For now, I think we should put up with the delays.  I expect there 
will be a few more.

15 pounds of mouthpieces arrived today!  I pulled 3 at random and 
tooks some photos.  I put them in a new folder called "eMachineShop 
Blanks" in the Photos section of the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site.  I 
speced that the blanks be buffed so the pics have a lot of

I am pleased with them.  They show some variation but not more than I 
expected.  They look better than Sugals but not better than SRs, 
Laser Cuts, Lakey metals whaich are all nice CNC MPs.

Give me a few days to check them out dimensionally then I&#39;ll start 
shipping them out.  I do have a few extras for those that expressed 
interest.

The best way would be for you to have a Guardala Studio on your bench 
to glean whatever aspects you would like to incorporate into your own 
mouthpiece.

I do have some measurements off Laser Cut Studios.  I also own one. 
Any good facing curve that is well implemented will be fine, but I 
can supply what I have.  The key to the sound will be the baffle and 
chamber work.  I have some baffle measurements but I&#39;m not sure they 
capture the complete shape.

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] eMachineShop Order Has Arrived!!!



  15 pounds of mouthpieces arrived today!  I pulled 3 at random and 
  tooks some photos.  I put them in a new folder called "eMachineShop 
  Blanks" in the Photos section of the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site.  I 
  speced that the blanks be buffed so the pics have a lot of 
  reflections, glare, etc... but take a look.

  I am pleased with them.  They show some variation but not more than I 
  expected.  They look better than Sugals but not better than SRs, 
  Laser Cuts, Lakey metals whaich are all nice CNC MPs.

  Give me a few days to check them out dimensionally then I&#39;ll start 
  shipping them out.  I do have a few extras for those that expressed 
  interest.

            <pre class='message__body'>
I visually inspected all the blanks.  Out of 44, 3 could be 
considered rejectable, but are still usable.  They were supposed to 
supply from 40 to 50 blanks, so 41 "in spec" is within the 
agreement.  Delivery was originally promised 11/8.  Actual was 11/23.

One blank had a poorly defined 2nd bullet in the baffle.  In the 
photos, its the middle one in the Mojo25_1 photo.  Not a big deal 
since the baffle needs to be reworked anyhow.

One blank has 3-4 dinks on the outside of the shank.  One was not 
final buffed to a mirror finish.  Half of the blanks have a light 
score ring around the outside of the shank 1.2" away from the end.

I measured 3 in detail.  The initial facing is better than most mass 
produced mouthpieces I see.  The facing length is 44 and the rails 
are within .2 of being even from side-to-side.  The tip 
measure .080" inside the rail... but the rail is .100" thick!  They 
measure .093" near the very tip so this is not far off from my .095" 
target.  Some tables are flat some have a slight concavity with a 
high heel (like all new Babbitt Links have).

They actually play though the baffle is way too high to project a 
decent sound.  The flat top of the bite was comfortable enough for 
me that I will probably leave it alone at first.

The chamber volume measured about 15.7 ml (or cm^3).  This is on the 
small side for Bb tenor MPs.  Bb tenors typically fall between 17-19 
ml with Links being on the upper end.  C tenors are 15-16 ml.  But 
I&#39;ve been saying all along that the baffle needs to be finished 
lower.  You may also want to hog out the throat some.

The shank bore design is tapered slightly (1 deg on each side I 
think).  It is a little snug on my tenor neck cork.  On the end it 
is .657" ID.  .670" would be more typical.  As you enlarge the 
chamber you may need to sand the shank bore open a few .001" to get 
it on far enough to tune it.

I&#39;ll start mailing them out Friday 11/26.

            <pre class='message__body'>The numbers on the packaging refer to my visual inspection list.  I tried
to give everyone at least one totally blemish free blank.  The other one
will most likely have a score mark around the shank.

I would recommend copying your T45 facing curve to the blank as a starting
point.  

See my post #2442 from 10/12/04 for areas that need to be included in the
rework.  Also add opening up the shank bore to the list.  It probably
should be .015" larger, which is a lot of sanding work.  A sanding drum on
a rotary tool would help here.

The reason for plating is "looks" and to keep the brass taste away.

I have used the electroless nickel plate from Caswell. I picked up an 
old C melody that was really, really gross looking. It had some kind 
of brownish-red lacquer on it. My plan was to nickel plate the keys. 
Then steel wool the body and clear lacquer. Anyway, I learned a lot 
about plating while restoring this horn.

The electroless from Caswell works quite well--and I agree, I think  
I will do the same on my mouthpieces. Here is the key: the metal has 
to be clean, clean, clean. Did I stress that enough? If there is any 
buffing material in the crack or any kind of grease or anything, you 
will not get a good plate. Also this may contaminate your solution. 
The solutions are pretty expensive, &#39;cuz you have to buy a fairly 
large quantity when you refill...  Do not cut corners. If you do not 
prep it good, it will be way more work to trip the partial nickel 
plate from the piece and replate it. Believe me, I have been there. 
Just follow the instructions in the plating manual from Caswell.

If it is prepped good, it will have a really nice consistent plate 
all through the piece, even the bore. One other thing I would suggest 
is that you keep the heat at a point where the piece barely has some 
bubbles on it. I think Caswell now sells a fish tank type heater with 
the kit, but back when I used it, it came in an enamel pot and you 
boiled it on your stove. I used to turn the burner off and just let 
it sit until it stopped bubbling and then hit it with some heat. I 
would also highly recommend trying a scrap piece of brass first so 
you know what to expect. You don&#39;t want to muck up your mouthpiece 
and then have to strip it. You also need a piece of steel to start 
the reaction process.  I used to use a sax hinge rod...

Good luck,

Willis
