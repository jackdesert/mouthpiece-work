            <pre class='message__body'>The last time I cleaned and polished my testing mouthpieces, I finished by sealing them with bee wax. This has kept the old, hard, rubber ones really black and shiny for several months so far. These are out in the open, exposed to light and air 24/7, and would have turned by now. I picked up a tube of Walgreens BEESWAX lip balm, but Burt&#39;s Beeswax looks like similar ingredients. If I can put in on my lips, I figure it should be fine to consume a little. The hardware store stuff may have less additives, but I am not brave enough to use a furniture product in my mouth.

I also coated the inside in hopes less calcium build up will occur and the water should shed easier. Time will tell on that, too.
