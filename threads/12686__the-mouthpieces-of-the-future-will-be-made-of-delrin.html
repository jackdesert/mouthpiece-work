After several years of experiments, and many prototypes, we are very pleased to be able to offer our clients the first two models in our new series of Delrin saxophone mouthpieces.

The DuPont polymer, Delrin, although expensive (around $48 per foot), is the best material available for making saxophone mouthpieces because (1) it has far more acoustic resonance than any other material (including hard rubber and brass) and responds very quickly, producing an extremely broad sound spectrum and (2) it can be machined like metal (it is not heat sensitive) so mouthpieces can be manufactured to very close and extremely precise tolerances (less than 1/1000th of an inch), allowing unmatched playability. 

This material, when combined with CNC machining for the blanks and precise hand finishing and facing, produces mouthpiece which perform better than any other on the market, with a broader tonal spectrum, quicker response, a greater dynamic range, and significantly increased projection.


Insert title here

Both the Dragon&#39;s Tongue (red) and the Super Duck (blue) are somewhat high baffle mouthpieces with medium large threaded chambers. The Dragon&#39;s Tongue has a tapered ramp leading into the chamber, and the Super Duck has a long straight cliff baffle. Both have ultra thin rails for quick articulation and have our brass shank weight to increase resonance.

﻿Both the Dragon&#39;s Tongue and the Super Duck are HAND FACED

Like all Saxgourmet mouthpieces, each Dragon&#39;s Tongue and Super Duck mouthpiece is individually hand faced and play tested by Steve Goodson. This crucial steps assures that each mouthpiece meets our exact specifications and that it will perform perfectly on your saxophone. Hand facing is the ONLY way to attain this level of perfection.
