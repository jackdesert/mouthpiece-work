Guardala&#39;s partner, Jeff Powell (aka abbedd) often holds court on matters 
Guardala. Be warned, he is a pretty abrasive character, but he is apparently 
the man who designed the Guardala mpcs and cut them on CNC machines (after 
which Guardala finished them). He&#39;ll be able to provide you with the

            <pre class='message__body'>A word of warning: Jeff Powell NEVER owned more than 2 1/2 percent of the
shares authorized. He represents himself as knowing what was going on. This
is not the case. He was a machinist, and does not play saxophone (plays
French horn) and not involved in the "business side" of the company. Of
course, he will tell you differently. Dave, Dennis Bamber, and Dave&#39;s
ex-wife have all set the record straight to me directly. IMHO, Jeff is more
than a little delusional about his place in the grand scheme of things. Do a
search and read some of his posts on Usenet, and judge for yourself.

            <pre class='message__body'>What appears missing from all the accounts presented on the web is 
first-hand word from Dave Guardala.  His past partner, Jeff Powell, 
posts snippets of his version of the story from time-to-time on 
alt.music.saxophone.  Dave&#39;s ex-girlfriend appears to have posted 
there too.  Search for posts by "ansermetniac".  He also posted on 
SOTW a few months ago but they have been deleted from SOTW.  (I may 
have saved the posts.)

Jeff claims the Dave is still his partner but I do not see a way to 
confirm this.  Jeff has posted comments that indicate the recent 
products being offered under the Guardala name have been a surprise to 
him.  It looks like Dave is making deals without involving Jeff.  It 
is possible that some vendors are using the Guardala name without 
permission of all parties who have control of the name.  Legal action 
may or may not sort this out in the future.  

Steve&#39;s report make it sound like Dennis Bamber has some kind of 
contract to use the Guardala name.  There is a mouthpiece maker/seller 
in Germany who thinks he has rights to use it too.  Now saxes with the 
Guardala name are also appearing.  Are there contracts and are they 
sound?  We just do not know.  We do know there is some disagreement.

            <pre class='message__body'>It has been reported to me that the German venture is something Dave cooked
up AFTER he sold ALL of his rights and trademarks to Dennis. 

Jeff Powell has not been involved with the Guardala company for many years,
despite his representations to the contrary. He seems to believe that it&#39;s
still a going concern and he has something to do with it. Unfortunately,
this has not been the case for quite a few years.

I do not know what Jeff Powell does for a living, but working for the
Guardala company is not a source of employment for him, nor has it been for
some time. Why he persists in representing himself as involved with the
company is a source of mystery to me.

Keith Bradbury &lt;kwbradbury@...> wrote:    What appears missing from all the accounts presented on the web is 
 first-hand word from Dave Guardala.  His past partner, Jeff Powell, 
 posts snippets of his version of the story from time-to-time on 
 alt.music.saxophone.  Dave&#39;s ex-girlfriend appears to have posted 
 there too.  Search for posts by "ansermetniac".  He also posted on 
 SOTW a few months ago but they have been deleted from SOTW.  (I may 
 have saved the posts.)
 
 Jeff claims the Dave is still his partner but I do not see a way to 
 confirm this.  Jeff has posted comments that indicate the recent 
 products being offered under the Guardala name have been a surprise to 
 him.  It looks like Dave is making deals without involving Jeff.  It 
 is possible that some vendors are using the Guardala name without 
 permission of all parties who have control of the name.  Legal action 
 may or may not sort this out in the future.  
 
 Steve&#39;s report make it sound like Dennis Bamber has some kind of 
 contract to use the Guardala name.  There is a mouthpiece maker/seller 
 in Germany who thinks he has rights to use it too.  Now saxes with the 
 Guardala name are also appearing.  Are there contracts and are they 
 sound?  We just do not know.  We do know there is some disagreement.

I was advising you not to include gossip about the company or its principals.

According to a post by Jeff Powell, the Guardala company was involved with
the initial production runs of the original Laser Trimmed Guardalas.  They
did some quality control.  Later runs sold by WW&BW did not have any
involvement of the Guardala company.  Also, the box they are packaged in
says "hand-finished" even though there is no hand finishing on the Laser
Trimmed Guardalas.

The new Guardalas appearing now (with the Rovner ligatures) at WW&BW appear
to have no involment of the Guardala company.  The company, per se, may
only exist on paper.  There is no "staff" at Guardala.  The new German-made
Guadalas look similar to the Laser Trimmed one in the US.  But I have only
seen pictures.  The new MB2 is not like the original hand-made MB2.  The
new one has a bullet chamber like a King.  They are just using the Guradala
and MB2 name for marketing.  They may be fine mouthpieces, but not the same
as the originals.

            <pre class='message__body'>An associate of mine who visited the production facility and who is in no

familiar enough with the differences in the various models past and present
to comment on any differences, and would defer to Keith&#39;s considerable

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith and Steve... you are a treasure for me... living so far from States!
 
 I&#39;m very proud to tell both of you I&#39;ve test at home only one new Super King and I didnt buy for two big reasons. First my Barone Jazz8* is real my sound, and I called it my piece of butter, this mouthpiece let my SML to express the real character of this tenor. Second I got times ago a Dukoff D7 open and modified by Kei.... Mojo to .115, and when I want to have this kind of sound it play on that way, even more easy and where you can see a very nice hand job made with high refinement. You know what&#39;s the feeling when you look at the Dukoff chamber...
 
 I suggest a petition for Mr.Mojo as best refacer for Dukoff... sorry Keith the D8 is the only job I&#39;ve seen, but I&#39;ve in my mind to give you a P6 to reface and open to .110. I would like to know from you if you can give a darker tone, perhaps if P model is the darker of Dukoff, maybe with a longer curve of facing or as you well know.
