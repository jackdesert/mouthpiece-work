First off, let me say that this forum is GREAT!!!

The way I see it (please correct me if I am wrong) the lay schedule
goal is to create as perfect arc as possible from said tip opening to
the "break". It is my understanding that this will allow the reed to
speak freely in any register it needs to because of the precise
gradual curve.
If this is true, I should be able to plug in the facing length and tip
opening of any given mpc (into Keith&#39;s great Excel tool) and it should
be able to tell me the lay schedule at given points
(.002,.005,.010,etc...)

Have I got it!??
Has anyone found this to be contrary to results?
Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes.  Patrick, Santy Runyon wrote a nice series for a magazine back in
the early 60&#39;s, where he discusses various types of facings, baffles,

clarinet mouthpieces.  This also applies equally well to sax
mouthpieces.  This series has been reproduced on this site, but I will
email it directly to you.

He describes various facings and tells what the problems are, and why a
curve which is a portion of a perfect circle is best.  He carried this
over to his manufacturing, where his facing machine (which he also
designed) ran the milling tool in a straight line to cut the facing,
then hit a stop, and pivoted on a (adjustable!) radius to cut the facing
itself.  By adjusting the radius and position of the mouthpiece in the
machine, the facing length and tip opening could be infinitely variable.

I meant to say, "where his facing machine (which he also designed) ran
the milling tool in a straight line to cut the TABLE, then hit a stop,
and pivoted on a (adjustable!) radius to cut the facing itself."

Sorry, I hope this clarifies things.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just want to add something I found from Mr. Morgan...
1. We first consider the exacting demands of the reed in itsefforts to
vibrate at its normal moments at each finite point along the blade.
What that says is that, if you divide the length of the blade into 33
equal slices, then compute the mass, or weight of each slice, and then
compute the natural vibrational frequency of each slice, you will
have, in relation,the chromatic scale of the particular instrument
that reed fits. How about that for a mouthful?
2. Having done that, we now have to determine the actual vibrational
movement of each segment of the reed, which will lead us to a series
of points along an ever changing curve. By the way, there is no part
of the facing curve which constitutes an arc, since the points on an
arc are all equidistant from a common point.

So my useage of the word &#39;arc&#39; may be inaccurate, but rather the
&#39;curve&#39; from tip to break. This leads me to the feeler guage widths...
Why don&#39;t we use equadistant measurements if we do indeed want an even
curve.. (i.e. .002,.012,.022,.032,.042,.052,etc)

            <pre class='message__body'>I measured many mouthpieces to try to reverse-engineer the facing curves
that work best.  I looked for better curves for sax mouthpiece than a
radial arc, but I did not find any.  Santy&#39;s articles helped to confirm
what I found.

Ralph Morgan tried to make an argument against radial arcs on the SOTW
forum, but he did not articulate it very well and did not come back for a
follow-up clarification on it.  The empirical evidence I have shows radial
arcs are tough to beat.  There are a few variations that work for specific
goals, but the raidial arc is the foundation.  Sometimes the facing is a
intentionally little longer than calculated.  Sometimes the tip is more
flat or more curved.

As for questioning why we use the "standard" set of feelers, with their odd
spacing, my answer is I do not use them!  I think they made sense at one
time but are not the best choice today.  I think we should challenge old
standards if they do not make sense today.  We should defend them if they do.

rest are pretty spread out.

And they are equadistant from the tip, but we are not dealing with
straight lines, but curves.  Those are merely a way to define the curve,
as it breaks away from the plane of the table.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, mouthpiece tip openings for saxophone are MUCH larger than they
were in years past.  We need several size feelers larger than .050",
which was fine when alto sax tips were on the order of .055"-060", or
tenor not much larger.

            <pre class='message__body'>The set of feelers I use are slightly off the set I was trying to make up. 
For example, I decided I wanted a .100" feeler.  After I assembled my set I
measured them with calipers is several spots in the area where they were
going to be touching the mouthpiece and glass gage.  I then wrote the exact
reading on the feeler with a marker.  So my .100" feeler turned out to be
.0985".  I re-measure them every few months.  

I also flip them around to see if they are even on the left and right rail.
 If one way I get a low left rail, and flipped I get a low right rail, I
conclude that the feeler is tapered too much.  I then fix it or get a
replacement.

One problem when using additional feelers that are closer together is that
it is more difficult to adjust one reading by sanding the rails without
also affecting the neighboring readings.  If the sandpaper does not lay
flat, or you do not hold the mouthpiece at a steady and correct angle, you
will not adjust the one spot you want to.  A good strategy when using close
spaced feelers is to sneak up on a range of readings simultaneously rather
than going for each goal number one at a time.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Ralph is using the results of a detailed analysis that was done
many years ago.  He does not come across as fully understanding what he is
using.  The first step that needs to be done before applying the results of
an analysis is to review the underlying assumptions that the analysis is
based on.  You need to evaluate if the assumptions still are, or ever were,
valid.

The best I can tell, the analysis Ralph uses calculates an optimal facing
curve from the properties of the reed.  Using the results today assumes
that the properties of reeds have not changed (significantly) in 60+ years.
 That is, the cut of reeds are basically the same as they have always been.
 One also needs to consider if the analysis used captures the basic physics
of reed vibration.

The real test is: how well do his pieces play?  The answer is: they are
very, very good.   But so are pieces that have radial arc facings.  I&#39;ve
only measured one Morgan piece, a Bilger-Morgan sop sax MP.  I can not
conclude anything about what kind of facing he uses after measuring one
piece.  It looks radial to me.

I think so many mouthpieces have been made with radial facings over the
years, that reed manufactures have evolved their reed cuts to work well
with them.  What do you think they have been using to test their reeds?

            <pre class='message__body'>Peter:  The "glass gauge" is placed on the table of the mouthpiece, held 
in place by the thumb, and the tip and glass pressed gently to a 
vertical surface (edge of the workbench), with the table of the 
mouthpiece horizontal, thus aligning the edge of the glass with the tip 
of the mouthpiece.  The edge of the glass guage is "zero".

Then the .0015" feeler, 0.04 mm, (the standard for measuring facing 
length, but .002", 0.05 mm, works as well) is slid in until it stops, to 
measure facing length.

While this does not find the exact spot where the curve meets the plane 
of the table, it is close enough!

The area where Mr. Fobes describes as becoming flat is the area right at 
the tip rail.  The facing between where the .0015" feeler touches, and 
the tip rail, should be a smooth curve, or arc of a circle.

Any sudden change in radius results in more resistance or other response 
quirks, the reed has difficulty smoothly wrapping around the facing.

Yes, I understand - I&#39;ve been measuring mouthpiece facings for a while now (thanks to your tips - and keiths&#39;, and many others on this group).
I included this description from Mr. Fobes in light of the recent thread on facing curves, and the "ideal" curve being a radial arc. Mr. Fobes said that - at least his facings - have a flat area right at the tip. I found that interesting.
 
That, and the fact that he said that facings are always measured in mm (most - if not all - the facings I&#39;ve seen are 2*mm - using the usual glass gauge.)
 
(Oh, BTW - my glass gauge has an offset zero, so I don&#39;t align the edge of the glass gauge with the tip - I have to "eyeball" the tip to the "zero" - but I get pretty consistent results this way)
 
Thanks
-Peter

Subject: Re: [MouthpieceWork] Re: Goal = evenness of arc


Peter:  The "glass gauge" is placed on the table of the mouthpiece, held in place by the thumb, and the tip and glass pressed gently to a vertical surface (edge of the workbench), with the table of the mouthpiece horizontal, thus aligning the edge of the glass with the tip of the mouthpiece.  The edge of the glass guage is "zero".

Then the .0015" feeler, 0.04 mm, (the standard for measuring facing length, but .002", 0.05 mm, works as well) is slid in until it stops, to measure facing length.

While this does not find the exact spot where the curve meets the plane of the table, it is close enough!

The area where Mr. Fobes describes as becoming flat is the area right at the tip rail.  The facing between where the .0015" feeler touches, and the tip rail, should be a smooth curve, or arc of a circle.

Any sudden change in radius results in more resistance or other response quirks, the reed has difficulty smoothly wrapping around the facing.

In an article i read recently by Clark Fobes (on his web site, and on 
woodwind.org), he describes the facing curve thusly:

"It is not actually a full arc to the tip. The area just below the 
tip is flat. The length of the curve is measured from the tip to the 
point where the arc breaks away from flat. Always decribed in 
millimeters."

I found this last sentence interesting, too... :-)

and to explain to other readers, to remove any confusion on which flat 
area (the table or tip rail) described by Mr. Fobes was being spoken of.

Yes, facings are always measured in mm&#39;s, OR in half mm&#39;s (Eric Brand 
system).  Eric Brand felt that it was necessary to measure the curve, 
with feelers, to the nearest half millimeter (and I agree), but he did 
not want to use decimals.  So, he doubled the numbers... a facing length 
of 22.5 mm on his guages would have a reading of 45.

Actually, my Winslow glass gauge is not true mm&#39;s, but .04" per 
increment.  The difference is so little as to be meaningless.

In practice, to do good work you need to measure to the nearest .5 on 
the Eric Brand scale anyhow.  I even split hairs and measure to the 
nearest .25 (=.125 mm).  If a reading is between 45 and 45.5, I dont 
agonize over which is better, I just call it 45+ or 45.5- (whichever 
I think of writing first).

Sometimes a reading looks like its 1/3 or 2/3 between the lines on 
the glass gage.  Heck, if that is what it looks like, write it down!  
So between 44 and 46 on the gage, 1/3 = 44.66 and 2/3 = 45.33.

Generally, there is not much to be gained in correcting flaws that 
measure .25.  You also need to be concerned that those small 
differences are not just gaging errors (human and/or hardware).

          Have never seen a FOBES mouthpiece but I believe the flat section is wider than just the width of the tip rail.
 
          I found mouthpieces with a couple MM of flat area at the tip end to be real easy players with little resistance. 
          To me the most gain is when playing softly.   This is especialy true with small mouthpieces like soprano sax .
           On tenor sax I would only try to get a "flat" tip if it is a really huge tip opening.
           I like to follow a radial arc facing then leave the last couple of millimeters "flat" . Thus, leaving the tip opening a 
           fraction smaller than the radial arc facing would suggest.
           If the flat section is to long the mouthpiece will close up to easily.

Paul,
 
Yes, I understand - I&#39;ve been measuring mouthpiece facings for a while now (thanks to your tips - and keiths&#39;, and many others on this group).
I included this description from Mr. Fobes in light of the recent thread on facing curves, and the "ideal" curve being a radial arc. Mr. Fobes said that - at least his facings - have a flat area right at the tip. I found that interesting.
 
That, and the fact that he said that facings are always measured in mm (most - if not all - the facings I&#39;ve seen are 2*mm - using the usual glass gauge.)
 
(Oh, BTW - my glass gauge has an offset zero, so I don&#39;t align the edge of the glass gauge with the tip - I have to "eyeball" the tip to the "zero" - but I get pretty consistent results this way)
 
Thanks
-Peter

Peter:  The "glass gauge" is placed on the table of the mouthpiece, held in place by the thumb, and the tip and glass pressed gently to a vertical surface (edge of the workbench), with the table of the mouthpiece horizontal, thus aligning the edge of the glass with the tip of the mouthpiece.  The edge of the glass guage is "zero".

Then the .0015" feeler, 0.04 mm, (the standard for measuring facing length, but .002", 0.05 mm, works as well) is slid in until it stops, to measure facing length.

While this does not find the exact spot where the curve meets the plane of the table, it is close enough!

The area where Mr. Fobes describes as becoming flat is the area right at the tip rail.  The facing between where the .0015" feeler touches, and the tip rail, should be a smooth curve, or arc of a circle.

Any sudden change in radius results in more resistance or other response quirks, the reed has difficulty smoothly wrapping around the facing.

In an article i read recently by Clark Fobes (on his web site, and on 
woodwind.org), he describes the facing curve thusly:

"It is not actually a full arc to the tip. The area just below the 
tip is flat. The length of the curve is measured from the tip to the 
point where the arc breaks away from flat. Always decribed in 
millimeters."

I found this last sentence interesting, too... :-)
