            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the details.  You always provide very good info on how to 
get the job done.  I was wondering though, what size copper or other 
metal tubing do you use?  I realize you have to use different for 
different diameters but what thickness?

            <pre class='message__body'>Sigmund:  I have several diameters of aluminum tubing
which I buy in 6 foot (just under 2 meters) lengths
from a local hardware store. The wall thickness
appears to be about 2mm.

For copper, I look at the copper water pipe nipples
and tubing in the plumbing section.  You can find even
more diamters, both the basic tubing sizes, and in the
fittings, the ends are slightly larger to slip over
the standard tubing sizes.  So, that gives you a lot
of sizes to chose from.
