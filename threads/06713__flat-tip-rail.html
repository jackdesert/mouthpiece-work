            <pre class='message__body'>HI, any tips on how to reface a mouthpiece with a flat tip rail? (one that does not follow the facing curve) It seems that working with a flat surface and sandpaper would not be the correct technique for this kind of mouthpiece.  any advice? 

thanks

But the entire facing curve, from the flat table to the very tip, is shaped using a flat surface with sandpaper on it.  The work is guided by frequent measurements using the glass gage and feeler gages.
