            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys,

Having filed the tip back on a link I&#39;m refacing I&#39;ve ended up making
the window opening shorter as well.  Is this a big deal or is there a
certain length that works best?  I&#39;m thinking I may need to file the
window back a bit as well . . .

Regards,
Andrew

It is not a big deal.  You can leave it or file it back.  If you file it
back, you may want to undercut it some at the base of the window "U".  A
blunt edge here does not seem to blow as well to me.

Thanks Keith, I&#39;ll give that a go.

            <pre class='message__body'>I find that extending bottom of the window helps to make the low notes 
speak easier, especially low C and the bell keys.  I think this is the 
same kind of principle that helps the drilled reed that bootman uses to 
help make low notes speak. I surmise that extending the window gives 
the stocky part of the vamp less resistance to vibrate on low notes. I 
have also found that if you extend the window too far, you get a raspy, 
gritty kind of sound, which I don&#39;t find pleasing.

For me, especially on a baritone mouthpiece, I try to play the low 
notes and see how easily it speaks.  Of course the horn has to be in 
good mechanical order. If I feel it could use some help, I slowly 
extend the window down and test play to see if it is easier to play low 
notes.
