            <pre class='message__body'>&lt;PRE>I wont "tussle" with you "mechs", I find your discussions very interesting, 
having had some metallurgy and plating courses [back in the dark ages] . I 
did study [or try to] briefly the "grain [crystal] structure" of platings, as 
for auto bumpers [ala 1940&#39;s], Cu "flash", bright nickel, chrome, and came to 
the conclusion that, because of the electrolytic deposition ?, it was much 
finer than what magnification was available, So, I would doubt plating 
cracking would be a serious problem, "peeling" of layers might be.  If anyone 
experiences it, please post as I still have some interest.  Don, Mich. State
