            <pre class='message__body'>Gentlemen and Ladies,

I noted in passing on this group mention of a facing change that
reduced "chirping" with a sax mouthpiece.

Please offer me advice on a chirping problem I&#39;m having.

I have a few Bb soprano clarinet mouthpiece home for a trial.  One is
pretty wonderful, it is a Mitchell-Lurie M3.  It allows me to play
very softly without airiness; and it plays loud enough to blow the
music stand up against the wall.

The problem with this piece is that it "chirps" when tongued.  That
just makes it impossible to use.  

Is it worth finding someone to modify the facing, or is there another
make or model of mouthpiece that plays like the M3 --but does not chirp?

Thanks  in advance for your help

            <pre class='message__body'>Chirping is sometimes caused by an uneven facing. Check that the tip and side rails are even. And of course check with a few different reeds if you haven&#39;t already. Sometimes an uneven facing can be counterbalanced by an uneven reed, though, so it is most important to check the facing, even if a different reed seems to solve the problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>I ran into this with a bari mouthpiece, an RIA metal.  The guy even sent 
me some of his reeds, Vandorens.  I could not make it chirp with other 
brands, just the Vandorens.  I sent him back the mouthpiece, untouched, 
with some of the reeds I had used, and he had good results with them, too.

Sometimes it isn&#39;t the mouthpiece, and it isn&#39;t just the reed, but the 
combination.  So, try some different reeds.

Too thin tip rail can also cause chirping.
