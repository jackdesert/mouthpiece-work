            <pre class='message__body'>Gentlemen and Ladies,

I noted in passing on this group mention of a facing change that
reduced "chirping" with a sax mouthpiece.

Please offer me advice on a chirping problem I&#39;m having.

I have a few Bb soprano clarinet mouthpiece home for a trial.  One is
pretty wonderful, it is a Mitchell-Lurie M3.  It allows me to play
very softly without airiness; and it plays loud enough to blow the
music stand up against the wall.

The problem with this piece is that it "chirps" when tongued.  That
just makes it impossible to use.  

Is it worth finding someone to modify the facing, or is there another
make or model of mouthpiece that plays like the M3 --but does not chirp?

Thanks  in advance for your help

I&#39;m pretty sure I have a Mitchell Lurie M3 (an old one) in my box of 
project pieces at work. I&#39;ll have a look at it and see if I can maybe 
shed some light on your dilemma. What brand and strength of reeds are 
you using?

            <pre class='message__body'>Chirping is sometimes caused by an uneven facing. Check that the tip and side rails are even. And of course check with a few different reeds if you haven&#39;t already. Sometimes an uneven facing can be counterbalanced by an uneven reed, though, so it is most important to check the facing, even if a different reed seems to solve the problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hello. Is it possible to define "Chirping " for me please? I know about squeaking alright but "chirping" is a new one! I now have a &#39;Ridenour MPc and use Vandorens ,2 or 2 &1/2 reeds and I still squeak!! I suppose I also need to know if I need an MPc with a more open lay?

            <pre class='message__body'>By "chirping," I mean that when the tone starts, it starts with a

nothing to stop the "chrip."  It just quickly goes away.

            <pre class='message__body'>I ran into this with a bari mouthpiece, an RIA metal.  The guy even sent 
me some of his reeds, Vandorens.  I could not make it chirp with other 
brands, just the Vandorens.  I sent him back the mouthpiece, untouched, 
with some of the reeds I had used, and he had good results with them, too.

Sometimes it isn&#39;t the mouthpiece, and it isn&#39;t just the reed, but the 
combination.  So, try some different reeds.

Too thin tip rail can also cause chirping.

            <pre class='message__body'>Stan Getz often had a chirp at the beginning of a note . I think he used a hard reed with a 
small opining . I don&#39;t know if it bugged him or not but I sort of liked it (or got used to it 
after 1000&#39;s listening) .
