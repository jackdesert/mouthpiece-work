            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I love Lawton mouthpieces and have just contributed to a thread on 
SOTW.  http://www.saxontheweb.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t2518

My contribution was a transcription (scanned and OCR&#39;ed) of an 
interview with Geoff Lawton done by John Robert Brown and written up 
in the UK Clarinet and Saxophone Society magazine of winter 1996.

It gives some insights into Lawton&#39;s history, materials, 
experimentation and philosophy.

All the best

Rhys
