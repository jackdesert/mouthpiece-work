Can you open any of the files?  Perhaps your membership is not fully 
activated by Yahoo.

The Link 6 file is saved in an older Excel 5.0/95 format as are 
several of the other files.  Newer spreadsheets should also be able to 
open them.  I just updated the Link 6 file to show the Winslow Feeler 
set too.  It is good that the Winslow set has larger sizes.  But they 
have some odd spacing intervals.  The distance between .0015 and .010 
and .031 and .048 are large and .024 to .031 is small.  The plot in 
the spreadsheet really shows this.

I choose the facing length of 47.  The factory spec may be slightly 
less than this.
