            <pre class='message__body'>Dukoff made the fluted chambered mpc, some models like RPC have an 
excavated shallow channel in the floor of the mpc.  Putting aside the 
overall chamber differences of these two mouthpieces what is the effect 
of fluting?  

I know (or believe) that excavating the chamber makes it larger, 
darker, and gives a thicker tone.  Fluting is also removing material.  
Does the movement of the air across the foor through the 3 small 
channels make a difference than across a single channel like on an 
RPC?  Any experience with this...I guess I can always cut on some junk 
to compare if no one is sure.  I imagine its a lot easier to cut one 
bigger channel than three smaller...but I wonder if there is an 
advantage/difference.

From an aerodynamics perspective, I think the Dukoff fluting is too far 
back from the tip to make any significant difference from a smooth 
baffle.  Looks cool, though.  A stylish way to increase the volume of 
the chamber.

This is similar to the old Vibrator reeds with the valleys carved into 
them - though the carving on the reeds might actually affect the way 
they play.  I&#39;ve not filled any of mine in to see if there&#39;s a 
difference!

A gradual change in the cross sectional profile makes airflow more 
efficient - which is why a significant step-baffle is more resistant 
than a gradual roll.

Acoustically, the same principle applies - which is why the ends of 
projecting wind instruments (i.e. not flutes), PA tweeters, etc. tend 
to flare.  Makes the sound more omni-directional (our observance of the 
efficiency).
