            <pre class='message__body'>Here&#39;s the complete post I put up on SOTW:

I have 15 clarinet mouthpieces, which I&#39;d like to sell as a lot.

1. Vandoren 11.1 - faded, but almost unplayed
2. same as #1
3. yet another 11.1
4. Vandoren 2RV - also quite faded, but almost unused
5. Vanoren B45 - very good condition, little used, older polished table.
6. Vandoren 11.6 - lettering faded, great shape
7. Selmer HS* - moderate wear, some calcium
8. Selmer S - much older model with the S stamped on the table in a
circle. Green, but not nasty tasting, and in good playing condition.
9. Vandoren V360 - some use, lig marks on top
10.SML - very little playing wear, faded near tenon. stamped "SM"
beside table.
11. Selmer HS** - older, worn, but quite playable
12. Gennusa Excellente GE - new pro model Gennusa mouthpiece, very
deep baffle, lightly play tested. like new condition
13. Gennusa Excellente GE*S - like new Gennusa intermediate
mouthpiece, made from acrylic
14. Selmer HS* Eb Clarinet - very good shape
15. Geo. M Bundy Alto clarinet - slightly rough tip, but playable.
good quality hard rubber.

I don&#39;t want to have to itemize and price and then individually ship
every piece on this list, so I&#39;m offering it as a lot at $300 USD plus
Expresspost shipping from Toronto. I&#39;ll ship anywhere in Canada or the
lower 48.
