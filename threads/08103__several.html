            <pre class='message__body'>. . . . I used white acrylic powder to repair the white tooth guards on two
Brilharts. One of the original pads was worn all the way through to the
black mp body. When adding white "paint", I noticed that I was picking
up tiny amounts of the black body pigment from the bottom of the gouge. Therefore, the patch is not as
bright white as the original (something that I noticed but most people
probably would not based on the fact that it&#39;s an old mp). What this
tells me is beware of MMA. It does have the ability to dissolve the mp,
even though slightly. . . .

I wonder if, after applying a very thin coat and, letting it dry completely, the rest of the layers might not turn out whiter, as the amount of black mouthpiece that is dissolved by the MMA will be bound up in the first layer and therefor, will not be affected during the subsequent layers.

 Nice descriptions,


David
