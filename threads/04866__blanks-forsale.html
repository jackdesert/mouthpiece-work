  This is a great thread I think. At least for me a novice mouthpiece maker. What are the sources for blanks both rubber and metal for both clarinets and saxes of all sizes. 
   
  (a) There are three main suppliers.  Zinner in Germany, J. J. Babbit in the US (who make Meyer, Link, and a number of other brands), and Runyon Products in the US.
   
  Do the blank makers stamp a logo on the mouthpiece for you or if not where do we look for this service.
   
  (a) They can, if you supply the hot stamp.  If not, they can have one made, but this is costly, of course.
   
  I have just been using shells of other makers and refacing them with some work to baffle etc when necessary. 
   
  I would love to get a blanks from someone, especially if they could mold them to my specs based on a finished mouthpiece I would send them. 
   
  (a) A complete core and die set for a mouthpiece is very expensive, $50,000 or more.  It is necessary to sell a LOT of mouthpieces to make back the cost of dies and cores.  
   
  The more information on this subject form the list the better. It would be sincerely appreciated.
   
  (a) What some custom "mouthpiece makers" do is find an existing product that is close to their needs, and then have the manufacturer mold the blanks, and the custom maker modifies them to his specifications.  
   
  In the US, talk to Rocky Giglio at J. J. Babbit (www.jjbabbit.com) or Leroy at Runyon Producdts (www.runyonproducts.com).

            <pre class='message__body'>In the past I have obtained very cheaply, for learning purposes, Runyon Model 22 alto and tenors that had cosmetic flaws, but were otherwise good mouthpieces.
   
  But for now I can order the basic Model 22 alto and tenor with no stamp.
   
  The Model 22 was the white (actually ivory color) mouthpiece that Charlie Parker played.  It is now marketed as a student mouthpiece, and a very good one at that.  Many manufacturers have them stamped with their name but I am not at liberty to disclose.
   
  I can take a Model 22 alto, put a good reed on it, and easily produce a classical tone (even altissimo!) that is every bit as good as the famous French mouthpieces.  It is an excellent mouthpiece that Mr. Runyon had tested for intonation with just about every saxophone on the market.  He was especially concerned that students have good results, playing in tune, producing a tone acceptable to the band directors, and at a price easily affordable.
   
  I can get these mouthpieces as complete "kits", with ligature and cap, retail packaging, in the $25-$30 range, depending on model.
   
  But I can get the mouthpiece only, no ligature, no cap, no packaging, and no logo stamped, but with the facing already machined, for about $5 each (or less).  For clarinet, the cork is applied and shaped.  The more I order, the cheaper I can get them.
   
  The standard facing is Runyon&#39;s 4 or 5.  For alto sax, that is .066" to .070".  There is enough material to reface larger, as large as .080"-.085".
   
  The material is easy to work, but quite durable.  These mouthpieces are molded from a proprietary blend of acrylic and synthetic rubber that has the same "flex modulus" (meaning it vibrates the same) as hard rubber.  This material does not warp or wear with time like hard rubber.

  Hi Paul

  I trust that you are well and have not had to weather any more storms.
  I&#39;ve just received your message to the board re the model 22 Runyon Alto pieces. 
  Is it possible to order the standard blanks ( no lig or cap) through you?
  I would require 10 of the size 5&#39;s

      Yes, alto or tenor?
   
  I would estimate shipping to AU at $12.00 US.

    Hi Paul
   
  I trust that you are well and have not had to weather any more storms.
  I&#39;ve just received your message to the board re the model 22 Runyon Alto pieces. 
  Is it possible to order the standard blanks ( no lig or cap) through you?
  I would require 10 of the size 5&#39;s
  cheers

          Paul, I don&#39;t wish to take advantage of your good
intentions, but, would I be able to get 5 alto pieces
as part of this order? I&#39;m in the Ottawa, Canada,
area and would be happy to pay shipping up here. They
would give me an opportunity to experiment a bit.
