            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, I know this is the conventional wisdom, and where the tip rail is concerned, I think it’s demonstrably true. But the area of the side rails in contact with the reed shouldn’t change as a result of thinning those rails *from the outside* - the reed width doesn’t change and it extends over the rails from the window. Thinning from the outside, to my mind, only thins the area of rail that’s exposed beyond the edge of the reed. Why does this affect the reed’s response one way or the other?

Narrow side rails articulate quicker. thin them from the outside of the mouthpiece.

Good day guys

 

 

I refaced this mouthpiece and on the process i noticed side rails became thicker. I just want to know if it is possible to make the side rails thinner? And how to do it..

 

 

What is the effect of the thick side rails on this mouthpiece??

 

 

Thank you
