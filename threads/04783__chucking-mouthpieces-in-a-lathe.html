            <pre class='message__body'>I am a machinist and there is a tool you can make to do the job you are  
talking about. It&#39;s not that complicated but may be hard to describe in typed  
words but I&#39;ll give it a shot. You would start out by making a bar from a piece  
of stock that slips easily into the bore of the mouthpiece. Next find a 
machine  screw (the kind with the tapered head to go into a countersink) of a decent 
size  (10-32 maybe and relatively long) and put a countersink in the end of 
the bar  slightly bigger than the head of the screw. Next, drill and tap a hole 
in the  end of the bar for the screw. Then you want to make two cuts in the 
end of the  bar maybe an inch deep 90 degrees from each other making four kind 
of fingers in  the end of the bar with the screw in the middle. When you slip 
the bar into the  mouthpiece and tighten the screw it pushes the fingers 
outward and grabs the  mouthpiece. Then just chuck the bar up in the lathe and go 
to work. Hope this  helps!

  This MAY allow enough room for you to just cut the rubber.  
   
  I think Ferree&#39;s and Allied both have it.

  I have seen a chuck of sorts that inserts into the bore.  It is used by mouthpiece manufacturers and repairmen to rotate the mouthpiece while quickly cutting/sanding the cork to shape.

  This MAY allow enough room for you to just cut the rubber.  

  I think Ferree&#39;s and Allied both have it.

            <pre class='message__body'>I should also have added that of the two I own, only one is suitable for lathe use due to lack of trueness of the other.  I have also used a machine lathe but hand turned using a small piece of tool steel ground on an angle diagonally across the corners (an idea picked up from a watchmaking book I used to love looking through) or a watchmakers graver. This has been very effective for removing small amounts in tight places.
Best wishes,
Geoff.

  Arbour!  THAT&#39;s it, I couldn&#39;t think of the name.

      I have seen a chuck of sorts that inserts into the bore.  It is used by mouthpiece manufacturers and repairmen to rotate the mouthpiece while quickly cutting/sanding the cork to shape.

      This MAY allow enough room for you to just cut the rubber.  

      I think Ferree&#39;s and Allied both have it.

Like some other posters, we use a mouthpiece arbour for clarinet
mouthpieces in the shop all the time - for recorking. Since we use a
machine lathe, it&#39;s quite easy to use a cutter to take down the
diameter of the shank.

This is the same technique I use on tenor and alto mouthpiece to band
them with copper tubing.

I actually use a live centre, reversed in the chuck, and friction fit
the mouthpiece onto it.

Not elegant, but simple and effective.
