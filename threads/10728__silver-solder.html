My best advice is to work hot and fast.  You will have to heat the piece to some degree but making droplets of the silver is a good approach.

One thing to keep in mind is that you must lay down quite a bit more silver than you think you will need.  You will end up filing and sanding most of it off in the end.

            <pre class='message__body'>The brass must be hot enough to melt the filler metal, or the two won&#39;t fuse together, even if the filler is already made a molten droplet by the torch flame.  You can make a droplet on top of the cooler brass and then continue to apply heat until they fuse, but the longer the filler metal is heated, the greater chance gas bubbles 
will form, leaving imperfections in the surface that you can&#39;t file/sand
 out.  The accepted jeweler&#39;s approach is to flux and heat the brass first, then apply the filler metal to the hot surface, allowing it to melt.  There is a narrow temp. range just before it flows, where the molten filler has a putty consistency and can be shoved, piled up, and shaped with a solder pick.

Thin brass heats much faster than thicker brass, so be careful of the bite plate area.  

Practice on some scrap mouthpiece or brass pieces until you have a feel for what works best.

While silver alloy filler is insanely expensive at your local welding supply, a very good flux is quite cheap - Harris, Stay-Silv White Brazing Flux.  I get much better results with this than plain borax.

Yeah.  Be sure to take the bite plate off first. Don&#39;t ask me how I know ;).

As Lance said, you gotta get the piece hot enough to melt the solder or it won&#39;t stick. Count on replacing the biteplate after. I hope it isn&#39;t a Link, the solder at the seam may start to flow before the silver solder does. Don&#39;t ask me how I know ;).

After a couple practice attempts on scrap brass, I think I&#39;m not getting hot enough.  I was trying to use a propane air torch I had on hand, thinking the flame temp was 3000 F from memory.  I now see with air it is more like 2000 F.  Tough to bring a lump off brass up to 1100+ F fast (or at all) with a 2000 F flame.

So....  What is the cheapest upgrade I can invest in to get a hot enough flame?

      I got some of your recommended flux in.  Looks much better than the liquid stuff I was trying to use.  



After a couple practice attempts on scrap brass, I think I&#39;m not getting hot enough.  I was trying to use a propane air torch I had on hand, thinking the flame temp was 3000 F from memory.  I now see with air it is more like 2000 F.  Tough to bring a lump off brass up to 1100+ F fast (or at all) with a 2000 F flame.



So....  What is the cheapest upgrade I can invest in to get a hot enough flame?

      I got some of your recommended flux in.  Looks much better than the liquid stuff I was trying to use.  



After a couple practice attempts on scrap brass, I think I&#39;m not getting hot enough.  I was trying to use a propane air torch I had on hand, thinking the flame temp was 3000 F from memory.  I now see with air it is more like 2000 F.  Tough to bring a lump off brass up to 1100+ F fast (or at all) with a 2000 F flame.



So....  What is the cheapest upgrade I can invest in to get a hot enough flame?
