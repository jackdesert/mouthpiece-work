            <pre class='message__body'>Getting a flat table sometimes frustrates me.  I get there, but it 
sometimes takes too long.  The SS Berg I&#39;m doing now is getting to 
me.  

One key is finding a good way to hold and stroke a piece and sticking 
with it.  If you change mid way, you start a new angle and a get a 
convex surface.

Another problem is getting sandpaper to lay flat.  Wetting it helps 
some and lubricates the cut.  But I find that paper often still 
buckles up some at the edges of the piece while it is being stroked 
across the paper.

I&#39;m thinking of getting a "Lapping Plate" that machinists use.  Its a 
metal plate with grooves cut into it.  You use a gritty lapping 
compound on it.  The grooves collect the metal dust and excess 
compound.  

Anyone have experiance with lapping plates or other techniques to get 
a flat table?

            <pre class='message__body'>There is sandpaper, the kind and grit you use that comes with adhesive on the other side.  No more problems!  If this sounds like something you&#39;d like to pursue, I have the manufacturer.

            <pre class='message__body'>For keeping the sandpaper flat you can use 3M Repositionable Mount Spray found at any art supply store. This will keep the edges of the sandpaper from curling provided that it does not have a strong curl to begin with.
 
For heavier grit paper with a pronounced curl on heavier paper, you can use 3M Photo Mount spray. If you use your sandpaper on glass plate, you will be able to remove this from the glass, though the adhesion is intended to create a permanant mount for photographic paper on art board. If you encounter difficulty removing the adhesive from the plate glass, a little acetone or mineral spirits will clean it up very quickly.
 
Don&#39;t spray this stuff inside unless you have very good ventilation and a gas mask.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes Fred, lay a source on me.

I&#39;ve looked for the spray before at a decent photography store and they had
never heard of it.  

I&#39;ve tried some double stick tape.  It helps, but you have to stay away
from where the tape is located.  It makes a bump.  Also, I sometimes like
to use wet paper and rinse it off.  But you can not have everything.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

It&#39;s Klingspour Self-Adhesive Abrasives.  I&#39;ve just now sent for their catalog.  A friend of mine has been using the self-adhesive for years to flat-out the tables on his mpcs.  I&#39;m just now starting to get involved with this.  You just motivated me to get the catalog.

I have a 10"X10" 3/8 glass piece.  With this abrasive the paper lays down absolutely flat.  When it loses it&#39;s abrasive quality, it&#39;s a cinch to take up the paper, so there is no real cleaning to do as there is with the spray, and the spray is messy.

Cheers,

Fred

            <pre class='message__body'>BEFORE you start, look at the back side of the sandpaperï¿½ actually, I
use the dark gray silicon carbide paper.  Remove any price stickers,
otherwise when you pass the mouthpiece across that lump created by the
sticker, it will ruin whatever fine work you did.

I&#39;m not surprised. Generally, photographers don&#39;t fool with the stuff unless they&#39;re mounting their photos on artboard or they work for an ad agency. The guys who work in the "pro" camera store in my town hadn&#39;t heard of it either until I pulled it off their shelf and showed it to them.
 
The "photographers" who work in camera stores are a lot like the guitar players who work in music stores AND WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH GUITAR PLAYERS KNOW...
 
I think that Fred&#39;s suggestion is better than mine. I have used the adhesive sandpaper on my rotary sander and my plane sander. The adhesive on the sandpaper solds better than the repositionable spray mount, and it isn&#39;t hazardous like the stuff in the spray can. Come to think of it, the adhesive-backed sandpaper SHOULD work better because the adhesive is applied very evenly.
 
I&#39;ve just never seen the adhesive backed sandpaper in the finer grits.

So far, I have not either.  220 and coarser.  It is also tough to get full
sheets.  Most are smaller to fit sanders.  I&#39;m not done searching yet...

            <pre class='message__body'>You guys might think about trying some spray-on glue like 3M Design Bond to
make the back of the paper tacky. This stuff is made for matting photos, etc
and is plenty sticky although it doesn&#39;t dry too hard and so should be
relatively easily removable.
