            <pre class='message__body'>Folks,

I play clarinet mostly but have started picking up my tenor again.

I used to play Bari softs on a metal Link 6.  I still have the reeds 
(they&#39;re from the 70s).  I&#39;m now using a metal Yanagasawa (5) Link 
style piece.

The Baris I have seem kind of bad (maybe they&#39;re just played to death). 

I&#39;ve compared them to La Voz medium soft.  The cane reeds are 
definitely better sounding.  Used to be, the Baris were only a tad 
worse than good cane reeds (and way better than most cane reeds). 

I&#39;m asking this question here because I know there are several Fibracel 
users out there. What would be the Fibracel strengths to try on this 
piece? 

Thanks,

M.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you like synthetic reeds, try the Legere reeds.  They are the best
synthetics out there.  They cost about $15-$20 depending on the
instrument you are buying them for.  They come in quarter-strengths, and
tend to play harder than cane reeds, so if you play a 2-1/2 cane reed
you would probably start with a 2.25 Legere.  They are warranted, which
means if the strength is wrong, you can send it back to Legere for a
different strength.  They are pretty good out of the box, in fact, if
you modify the reed it voids the warranty.  I have found them to play
very well, but not quite as warm a sound as a good cane reed, and not
quite as crisp of a tonguing action.  However, for most kinds of jobs,
especially doubling, they work GREAT because you don&#39;t have to worry
about the reed drying out while you&#39;re playing the flute part on some
show tune, etc.  http://www.legere.com for more info.  You can get them
from most of the mail order supply houses.

            <pre class='message__body'>Legeres are worth checking out.  I use them on clarinet.  On sax I prefer
Fibracells.  Baris are bright, Legeres dark, Fibracells somewhere between
them.  Soft synthetic reeds can get really buzzy.  So I would recommend 2.5
or harder in a Fibracell.  If 2.5 seems too hard, I would recommend a
smaller tip mouthpiece so you can use a 2.5.  But some tenor players are
going after this open, buzzy concept.  For them a 2 is worth exploring.

I&#39;m so much used to them that I don&#39;t feel any specific difficulty with altissimo. But you could be right: Fibracells actually might need more support and "drive" up there. But they are more "predictable" than cane. If it works today, it will also tomorrow. I don&#39;t really know the difference between Standard and Premium, as I only find the Premiums here in Europe, and even those with some difficulty.                                  db

            <pre class='message__body'>Fibracells are OK for the first octave of altissimo on tenor.  Beyond that,
good cane can be better.  Especially the cuts with thinner tips (the ones
that chirp easier).

One problem with Fibracells is that after 20 minutes of heavy playing they
get a tad softer.  If you dont start out slightly stiffer than you like,
then you will end up with a reed softer than you like later in the gig. 
Then you go for altissimo and it does not work like it did when you were
warming up.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d like to know anyone&#39;s experience with adjusting (balancing, etc.) 
synthetic reeds.  I have a regular Fibracell which seemed to shred under

            <pre class='message__body'>I use the Ridenour system on Fibracell reeds. I no longer use cane.

I was able to turn a bunch of old Fibracell dogs that I had been saving into
good players - I&#39;d say the Ridenour system has already paid for itself.

I&#39;ve occasionally even had success clipping Fibracell reeds and then using
the Ridenour system with them. Although my clipper seems to be getting dull
from clipping kevlar and it is becoming difficult to get a clean cut.

Re reed chirping: When there&#39;s more resistance on one corner of the reed
than the other, this creates torque on the reed and abnormal modes of
vibration. Ridenour&#39;s system addresses this issue.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use Fibracell&#39;s exclusively - I&#39;ve had no problems with altissimo, 
but I may just have gotten used to them (lately I&#39;ve been playing 
alto primarily, especially since my Tenor was stolen... :-(

I haven&#39;t played a cane reed in years, so I can&#39;t really compare 
playing altissimo on cane vs. on Fibracell.

I, too, have noticed that the Fibracell&#39;s get a tad softer after the 
first rehearsal/gig... bummer, since I just bought 10 of them

Mr. Ridenour has developed a way of balancing reeds to get them to play
better. One has to learn how to play-test a reed for imbalances, and then
use his tool and method to correct it. Learning to test a play-reed by his
method takes some practice to develop the skill, though. But it really is
amazing - when you find a reed that&#39;s obviously unbalanced and plays badly,
and correct it - what a difference!

He discusses balancing reeds here:
http://www.ridenourclarinetproducts.com/adjusting.htm

His kit is a package including an instructional DVD in which he demonstrates
the method, an explanatory booklet, a piece of heavy glass plate to work on,
a sanding block of his own design and a few sheets of fine abrasive that fit
the block.

He touts the system here:
http://www.ridenourclarinetproducts.com/ATG1.html

Here&#39;s a well-written example of one buyer&#39;s response:
http://test.woodwind.org/Databases/Klarinet/2004/09/000258.txt

I think it&#39;s slightly less expensive at www.wwbw.com, but at about $70,
pretty pricey. IMO well worth it, though. I still have problems with some
reeds, but I can do much more to get them to play well; it&#39;s very
empowering.

> Teal&#39;s book?

I think the chart in the Teal book is a somewhat useful guide to adjusting
the tonal balance of a reed.

With Ridenour, I think the idea is that AFTER you&#39;ve found a brand of reed
that has a tonal balance you like, THEN you use his system to precisely
finish the reeds so they will play very well; and (an important point) with
reduced effort on the player&#39;s part.

Ridenour&#39;s primary method is to balance uneven resistance across the tip of
the reed, detected by tooting the reed while damping one rail and then the
other. This is a player-driven active process that relies on how the reed
feels and responds when play-testing it.

As noted earlier, this is described in some detail here:
http://www.ridenourclarinetproducts.com/adjusting.htm

There&#39;s nothing like this in the Teal book.

Aside from the side-to-side balancing, his adjustment method and tool also
take cares of small irregularities in the cane that the reed cutting
machines leave behind, that compromise the reed&#39;s ability to vibrate freely.

Using Teals chart, I find that Ridenour&#39;s methodology can be adapted to
adjust the tonal balance of a reed; for example I&#39;ve used it to take off
material from the base of the vamp to lighten up a very heavy-blowing reed.
But he doesn&#39;t really discuss this kind of thing. Sanding the rails also
remains a useful expedient, as well as (probably) polishing the bottom of a
reed (can&#39;t do that to a Fibracell).

Another thing worth mentioning is that, compared to Ridenour&#39;s method,
using a knife blade or dutch rush on an area of the reed is as likely to
introduce irregularities in the surface of the reed as correct them.

After I learned and started using his method, my reaction was, "Gee, this is
so simple and obvious, why didn&#39;t I think of it?"  But I think there is real
genius in the way he put together lots of pieces of knowledge and common
sense to come up with his system.

            <pre class='message__body'>For me it is just the opposite... Fibracells respond well for me in the 
altissimo.  So well that on alto and soprano, you cannot tell the 
difference in my tone from the palm key notes into the altissimo, you 
can&#39;t hear "the break".  It just sounds higher.

On tenor there is a little change in tone.

As far as the "buzz", most of that is quite literally in your head.  
There is a little more "reed slap", and that tone is conducted through 
your teeth.  I have not found a listener yet who could tell when I was 
playing a Fibracell vs cane.  In fact, I have had players not be able to 
tell THEY were playing Fibracell, just that it was a "good reed".

            <pre class='message__body'>You cannot adjust Fibracells.  There is no way for us, the consumer, to 
cut, adjust, trim a Fibracell with ordinary methods.  Do not try to clip 
a Fibracell, it will just damage your reed trimmer.

I have adjusted BARI and Legeres, no problem.  I use 600 grit silicon 
carbide paper.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have seen Tom Ridenour adjust reeds with his system.

First, DO NOT make the mistake of thinking you are paying too much for a 
few simple tools and a tape.  You are not buying those... you are buying 
a method.  You are taking a lesson via the tape.  You are buying a way 
to make nearly 100% of your reeds playable.

Tom is one of the most logically thinking artists I have met.  So many 
artists are "artsy-fartsy"... and don&#39;t have a clue as to the mechanics 
of playing.  You will get vague advice like "practice more".  Well, if 
you aren&#39;t practicing the right thing, well, as they say, practice makes 
perfect.  And you perfect your mistakes.

Here&#39;s a good Tom Ridenour quote:  "A reed only has to do four things.  
It has to play low and it has to play high.  It has to play softly and 
it has to play loudly.  If the reed will do those four things, it will 
do everything you need it to do.  In my method I give you some simple 
playing tests to determine this, and a way to correct any shortcomings."

There, that is the kind of thing you can "hang your hat on".  I have had 
some invaluable conversations with Tom.  For me, Tom is among the guys I 
respect most.

It is possible to clip a Fibracell, but almost more trouble than it&#39;s worth.

The little actuating arm on a reed trimmer is not strong enough to use, as
these reeds are very tough (kevlar-resin composite). Using this will just
damage the reed trimmer as Paul said.

I lay the trimmer flat on a work surface while it holds the reed, and whack
the trimming blade down to make the cut, using a small hammer and a piece of
5/8" diameter steel rod.

A brand new Rigotti tenor trimmer worked quite well at first, but after
about 15 cuts, it fails to shear through some of the kevlar fibers, so the
reed appears to have a "hairy tip" after trimming. These can be cut by a
steady hand and small sharp scissors, but it&#39;s dicey.

So repeated use will make the reed trimmer duller. So far, the Rigotti still
works ok on cane.

A 25 y/o Cordier tenor reed trimmer was just not sharp enough at all to make
a good cut on a Fibracell. A newer Cordier soprano trimmer does pretty well,
leaving a few short kevlar hairs that don&#39;t seem to adversely affect
playability.

Ridenour&#39;s method works quite well for adjusting, or, to be more precise,
"finishing" Fibracell reeds. At almost $10 a pop, it&#39;s especially annoying
to get a Fibracell that plays badly, and some do.

It&#39;s also possible to sand the rails of a Fibracell. The reed has to be slid
on the paper so that the bottom membrane leads and is cut first, instead of
being pulled away from the reed.

Probably true. However the amount of material one removes is generally so
tiny (as opposed to the dust flying while working on a boat using a power
tool) that I can&#39;t see this as a seious health hazard.

I&#39;m more worried about the years I spent playing in smoke-filled bars.

            <pre class='message__body'> I agree that this is  the best method I&#39;ve run across to adjust reeds so
that they play. I&#39;ve been using the method for several months and find that
I can make most reeds playable and they seem to last a long time. I keep the
reeds clean, in reed holders and inside a 70 % humidity area (cigar
humidor). I wish I had this method about 50 years ago and I would have saved
a lot on reeds. I used to buy a box of 25 Ricos and throw away about 20 of
them. Thanks to Tom Ridenour, the players will be much happier and the reed
suppliers will sell less. Maybe that will make the reed price go down.
