            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everybody,

I&#39;ve got a new tenor MPC made of brass with no plating (because the
MPC maker doesn&#39;t find someone who can really do this job without
ruining it). I&#39;m not allergic to brass and it doesn&#39;t give me no bad
after-taste when I play it. And, for me, it plays very well.
I don&#39;t know if I have to send it to someone in order to do the
plating (the reasons could be : bad taste/allergic reaction/protection
from oxydation/other?) or it doesn&#39;t matter ??? 
Thank you for your help !

            <pre class='message__body'>I just received two Links back from Doc Frazier.  One a modern STM 
which had plating loss from refacing work - the other a vintage 
Tonemaster which was completely without plating.  Both look like new 
and now I can enjoy the big fat sound from my Tonemaster without the 
distracting brass taste.

This was my first experience having mouthpieces replated, and I am 
extremely pleased.
