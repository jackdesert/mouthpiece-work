By low do you mean longer or shorter facing curve?  I think you mean 
longer, which are higher numbers.

The spreadsheets can be used to make a variety of facing lengths for 
any tip opening.  Longer facing curves just need a larger radius.

Some of the posted Link facing curves have bumps and flat spots in 
them.  The points do not lie on a smooth radial or elliptical curve.  
Some may consider these as desirable features.  I consider them 
facing defects.  Curves with "flip tips" do not lie on a smooth curve 
either.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Keith,  
  
Indeed, upon further scrutiny, my little theory doesn't seem to hold up.  
  
I think I understand the spreadsheet - it generates the unique radial curve
which fits a given a tip opening / facing length combination. These three
Bergs (and the JvW Link measurements posted) measured _shorter_ at the "table"
end (small feelers), with the measurements gradually catching up to the
"radial targets". I thought I saw a pattern - a more gradual (flatter-than-
radial) curve near the table, then a sharper curve towards the tip (to get to
the measured tip length). If there was a _consistent and gradual_ deviation
from radial, this might be a deliberate facing plan. BUT..., I noticed that,
on one mouthpiece, I had mis- copied one number, making the deviation look
smooth when it wasn't. Another followed this pattern (below) but looks more
like it just has a high spot (the decline in the "Diff" numbers is not real
consistent), and the third was not even this consistent. So the evidence is
thinning... One thing: they all measure significantly shorter than the radial
targets near the table, as do the posted JvW Link measurements. This made me
curious, but it looks like I just have a couple of mouthpieces with similar
bumps and flat spots.  
  
_Feeler_ _Radial_ _Measured_ _Diff_  
.0015 50.0 50.0 0  
.005 44.4 40 4.4  
.010 39.4 36 3.4  
.016 34.8 31.5 3.3  
.024 29.9 28 1.9  
.035 24.3 23 1.3  
.050 18.0 17 1.0  
.063 13.3 12.5 0.8  
.078 8.4 8.5 -0.1

            <pre class='message__body'>It is common for the .0015" feeler to give a long facing curve measurement
while the rest of the curve does not.  I think this is from overshooting
the facing curve target and/or wear.  Just dragging the mouthpiece over a
table top a few times can alter the .0015" reading.

I would recommend that you try ignoring the .0015" measurement when fitting
radial curves to your measurements.  Then your fitted curve will tell you
what the .0015" target should have been.
