The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson

Have lots of light, good angles to see the process, don&#39;t use tools you can&#39;t get or custom tools you have made yourself. If we can&#39;t get the tools we can,t do the job. With your sax repair videos I have repaded three of my own saxes, there great.Can,t wait to see it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Please show close-ups of the actual work.  Mikole made a good video and his explanations were good.  However, it was difficult to understand what he was REALLY talking about because you couldn&#39;t actually see the mouthpiece while he was doing the work.

Thank you,

David

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, a well know tool manufacturer is making up a full set of tools
which will be offered for sale as a kit and be featured in the video. I&#39;m
using the same cameraman and same editor as the Saxophone Repair With Steve
Goodson video.
