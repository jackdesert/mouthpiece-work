            <pre class='message__body'>Phil,

Great pictures!  Fascinating for me, as an amatuer player, to get a peek at 
what goes into the making of your mouthpieces.

If you don&#39;t mind me asking, what is the material that you use for your 
biteplates?

Thanks!
Mike Ruhl

            <pre class='message__body'>Phil, 

Thanks for sharing these photos with us.  I&#39;m impressed by the amount 
of hand chamber work you do to your mouthpieces.  

How do you keep all those tenor chamber designs straight in your 
head?  Is it all by eye using a "control sample" of each one?  Is 
there less hand work in your new "Standard" mouthpiece.
