What reed to you test the facing with and who is testing it?  Theory 
meets practice here. Is there anything gained by testing  a 
mouthpiece with the softest reed possible and then a very hard reed?
 I would also be curious as to the resistance factor.  What do you do 
to the numbers very basically ...say 34  22  12  6  with tip 1.10  to 
increase or decrease resistance?    I&#39;m definitely rambling 
here......  thanks   John
