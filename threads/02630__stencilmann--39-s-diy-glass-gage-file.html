I opened stencilmann&#39;s DIY glass gage file in photoshop and changed 
the resolution to 1200dpi, then changed the length to 2.362205" and 
printed on and overhead transparency sheet. 

It came out almost perfect. I first made the length 4.72441 or 120mm 
and printed it on a laser printer set to 1200dpi and checked it 
against my ruler and it was right on. then I cut the length in half so 
that the lines would be the same as on a babbit glass gage (2=1mm).

Now I just need to find piece of glass the right size to mount it on.

Thanks for the details on printing this out. Please let me know if 
you think of a grid format that is easier to work with. For me, it 
works best with a magnifier. I use a page magnifier or an inspection 
lamp with a magnifier (very cool to have for mouthpiece work).

As far as glass goes, I&#39;ve been using small picture frame glass or 
microscope slides. Microscope slides work great and are cheap 
(~$0.50) but are thin and distort easily under too much pressure. 
Picture frame glass is thicker but can have imperfections.

BTW, I&#39;ve been out of commission for the last 3 months or so due to 
health reasons. I haven&#39;t been able to play the sax at all but for 
the last couple of weeks I&#39;ve been able to do some mouthpiece work 
and use the computer. When you aren&#39;t able to do much, working on 
mouthpieces can be very therapeutic.
