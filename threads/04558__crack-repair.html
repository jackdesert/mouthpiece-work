            <pre class='message__body'>I have a couple of mouthpieces with cracks through the beak that aren&#39;t valuable enough 
to have professionally repaired and would like advice on trying to repair them myself.  Any 
help appreciated.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve used epoxy. I dropped a plastic clarinet in high
school, mouthpiece cracked, I used the 50/50 mix epoxy
(available anywhere, I liked the 100 minute variety),
filled the crack, sanded it flush, and it worked fine.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for responding.  How did you get the epoxy into the crack?
These are cracked through, but not separate pieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Could be a job for super-glue - thinner consistency gets into those small
cracks easier. Epoxy (usually thicker) is good when there's a gap to fill, or
at least enough space to stuff the epoxy in. Also, search the previous posts
for info/experience/opinion on toxicity of these substances, especially when
they're on the part of the mouthpiece that's actually in the mouth.
