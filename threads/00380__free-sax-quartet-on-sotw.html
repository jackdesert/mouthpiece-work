            <pre class='message__body'>Sax Friends:

I am very excited to announce that you may now download FREE sax quartet
music from Sax On The Web.

http://www.saxontheweb.net/Coats/Arcanum.html

These will download as zip files, each containing two pdf files.  One
file is the score, the other the parts.  They are quite small, about
250Kb each zip.

Now, please understand, when you open these pdf&#39;s, they will appear
grainy, coarse,but will print out very clearly, as well as from my own
printer.  Your print quality is limited only by your printer.  I suggest
you get out that pack of 24# heavy paper.

I am sure you will enjoy these compositions by Ben Houge, transcribed by
yours truly, from string qt to SATB sax quartet.

While none are technically difficult, no finger busters, they still are
still challenging... good tone, phrasing, attention to dynamics, some
tempo and time signature changes.  It will certainly help to go to the
MP3 site (link on the webpage) and download the string qt MP3&#39;s.  I
would advise listening to these before playing the music.

I hope you enjoy Music From Arcanum.

Paul
