            <pre class='message__body'>I have several students that are playing new Meyer mouthpieces on baritone. They have to push in all the way to the end of their neck cork to be in tune. Can I cut the shank on their mouthpieces, so they will still have some cork showing for more accurate/consistent placement on the neck? If so what is the best method to cut the mouthpiece. 

Thanks for any advice.

            <pre class='message__body'>I wouldn&#39;t do it.  It&#39;s a sledgehammer solution to a simple problem. 
Even if you shorten the shank, the mouthpiece will eventually "bottom 
out" anyway.  If you&#39;re looking for the visual guide of the cork, I 
would have the neck re-corked with about 1/2 inch of extra coverage.  
And much cheaper than replacing a mouthpiece.

Alternatively, you could use a strip of white surgical tape and mark 
their average tuning position after the horn is warmed up.  After all, 
you already have a pretty good airtight seal, so cork isn&#39;t really 
needed at that point.

In reality, you probably have a chamber mismatch.  Depending on what 
you&#39;re trying to do, a Rascher or Caravan might have been a better 
choice.  I&#39;m sure Keith or Paul C. might have other suggestions as well.

I&#39;ve run into this a number of times, certain mouthpieces with certain saxes, or trimming a mouthpiece shank so that it will work correctly with a Conn Microtuner neck.

First, be sure you need to cut the shank, with other players checking tuning.  Then cut off no more than absolutely necessary.

I rough cut the shank with a band saw, then use a grinder to dress the end further.  Finally, I lap the end on 600 grit paper on glass, similar to flattening a table, then 800 grit, then 1000 grit.  And for the final step polish with a plastic polish (I use Kit Scratch Out, though Flitz metal polish does as well).  Make sure you chamfer the inner edge of the bore so that it slips on the cork easily without damaging the cork.

As always, I agree with your suggestions. If the player doesn&#39;t have a band saw, a hack saw with a fine blade will get the job done. The error I often see is that too much material is removed. A little bit goes a long way!

            <pre class='message__body'>You have the cart before the horse.  There is no law that says that the cork must extend past the mouthpiece.  In fact, any cork that extends beyond the mouthpiece shank is wasted and should be removed from the neck as it tends to deaden the vibration of the neck.  Yes, a little showing so you can mark your spot is useful, but if the end of the cork and the end of the mouthpiece line up, that should be precise enough.  But, whatever you do, DO NOT sacrifice your mouthpieces for the sake of a piece of cork!  It would be much better to recork the necks with longer corks instead.

Can I cut the shank on their mouthpieces, so they will still have some cork showing for more accurate/consistent placement on the neck? If so what is the best method to cut the mouthpiece. 

Thanks for any advice.

One mouthpiece we have for bass sax not only extends past the cork, but can not move far enough onto the neck due to the reinforcing rib on the neck. 

Sometimes you have to shorten the mouthpiece.

The LAST thing you want to do... no, I&#39;ll say never do, is chop off the end of the neck.
