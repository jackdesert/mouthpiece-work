Hey all,

I could use some help!

If any of you have any old instruments that you don&#39;t mind parting 
with (or you know a friend that has some), anything from recorders 
to instruments to just accessories, we are looking for donations! 
Sigma Alpha Iota (International Music Fraternatiy... for women...) 
is having an instrument drive for 2 local elementary schools (in 
Maryland) that are in need of instruments. Right now, anything helps.

If you have any old mouthpieces or ligatures that would be good for 
students, that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Check out this page: &lt;a href="http://www.instrument.sai-ge.org">SAI 
Instrument Drive!&lt;/a>

If you live far away, and would like to mail something, depending on 
what it is and how much it would cost to ship, I would be willing to 
pay for it. (It saves me money on membership to "donate" my own 
money) We also take cash donations, which I think will go towards 
the repair of the instruments. :)

We could really use your help!

Also, if you go to church or school, please spread the word. If you 
would like me to send you a few business cards that we are using for 
publicity, email your address to webmaster@.... (I&#39;m the 
webmaster :D ) Then maybe you can give them to your band director, 
or someone. My band director has already offered me a few 
instruments for the drive! It will be awesome.

Thanks everyone!
