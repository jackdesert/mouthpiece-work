You can try a longer facing, but Graftonites are usually medium long to
begin with.  You can try reed drilling too.

Part of the response problem of the Graftonite is the way the baffle is 
shaped near the tip rail.  This odd appearance is due to the fact the 
facing is not machined on, then the baffle filed to shape, but rather is 
molded on, a separate part of the mold, and no hand work is done to 
complete the mouthpiece.  This odd baffle shape causes the mouthpiece to 
be inherently stuffy.

I actually use a Vandoren S25 and was just wondering if I could turn 
this RR into a working mouthpiece, a backup, maybe. I guess I won&#39;t

Tots, I have found the Rico Royal Graftonite B7 to be a good soprano 
mouthpiece. To me, they have more of a medium chamber. From the 
measurements I&#39;ve taken, their chamber is smaller than all of my 
vintage soprano pieces. I&#39;ll see if I can dig up those measurements 
to see how the chamber volume compares to the Dukoff D8, Lakey, et 
al. They are a bit longer than other soprano pieces so they can 
benefit from having 6mm or so cut off the shank. 

The B5 has an opening of .060", which may be too closed for you. The 
B7 is .065" which is more middle of the road. Also, filling in the 
channel behind the tip can help bring them to life, but this can be 
tricky to do without causing interference with the reed.

IMO, Graftonites can make good blanks for mouthpiece work. I have 
found them to be very consistant and fairly easy to work on. I&#39;ve 
reworked about 20 Rico mouthpieces spread across soprano alto and 
tenor: some with bored out chambers, some with Delrin chamber 
inserts, some with high baffles and bullet chambers, etc.

Anyway, don&#39;t give up on your Rico. You could try cutting off the 
shank if it is too long, opening up the tip a bit, and building up 
the baffle behind the tip. I&#39;d be happy to do this work for you or 
send you one of mine just to see what you think.

Do you actually take volume measurements, or just inside diameters?  
I have dabbled in volume measurements by filling a piece with water 
then dumping it into a graduated cylinder.

I use a graduated cylinder. To me, the trouble measuring this way is 
the different shank lengths. A mouthpiece with a long shank will seem 
to have a larger volume that one with a short shank. If you chop off 
the end of a long mouthpiece, did you really change its internal 
volume when it is on the horn? No, it just doesn&#39;t cover as much of 
the cork.

For this reason, I fill each mouthpiece to a certain point from the 
tip. On soprano mouthpieces I fill to 45mm from the tip. For altos, I 
use 55mm. I don&#39;t know if these technique is valid or not but it 
makes sense to me. What do you think?

Thanks,
Jon Lloyd

            <pre class='message__body'>There is no good answer on how to deal with the shank area on the cork. The
amount you put the MP on differs from sax to sax and player to player. 
This is part of the reason I stopped measuring routinely.  

I just measured to the end of the shank and also took a bore diameter
reading.  I figured I could always calculate and subtract off a cylinder
volume for the amount that was on the cork for a specific analysis.

My volume measurement varied from 6.5 ml for a Runyon Custom Spoiler to 8
ml for a Bilger-Morgan.  That is quite a range for sop sax.  The average
was 7.4 ml.  This is why I balk at those who insist they need a C sop MP to
play in tune on a C sop.  With this range of volumes available for Bb sop,
one can find a MP that will work on their C sop.  Mine plays best with 8
ml...  larger than what I use on Bb sops.
