            <pre class='message__body'>Starter kits are generally not available.  Erick Brand, Morgan, amd Winslow
used to sell kits.  Recently some kits have been spotted on eBay.

Most of us here have made our own kits up.  There are resources on the
Yahoo MPWork site.  Check the files and photos areas.  Some of the links
are not current but there are alternatives.
