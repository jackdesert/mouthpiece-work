            <pre class='message__body'>The idea is to give the player 3 DIFFERENT sounds from the SAME mouthpiece….at a reasonable cost….the baffles shown (these are prototypes, not a finished product!) are all different in thickness, angle etc….and all sound very different….the mouthpiece blows exactly the same, so there is no "learning curve" for the player…..I think we&#39;ll ultimately market this for some of our mouthpieces…..you could conceivably even change baffles while the piano player takes his solo! I had already made up the brass one shown, and do the prototypes in polycarbonate (quicker to shape and adjust), but the production versions will be in brass….I&#39;ll come up with some system to color code them so they are easily identified…..I had some card carrying bad ass players over this afternoon to play test the prototypes, and everyone agreed they worked great…..I think our company already makes more different mouthpieces than anyone in the business, and this concept will give the players even more choices
