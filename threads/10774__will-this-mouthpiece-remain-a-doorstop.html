            <pre class='message__body'>I will try to make this brief and descriptive.  I will leave out the laments of players trying to improve mouthpieces and subsequently wrecking them.

I have an old vintage brass piece.  It currently measures .090.  It is a hack job and the facing is way to flat as it nears the tip.  Poor response and the palm keys, of course, take work to voice...dont even think about altissimo.

I dont know if there is a curve that will address this.  Id really like to keep the tip close to where it is.  Unfortunately, I dont have a file or a sheet of sandpaper that will add brass to extremely low points.

Im not a wizard of numbers.  I tend to spend most my time facing my own pieces with curves I know and like.  Perhaps some of you may take a stab at this:

.0015 - 48  (a bit shorter would be good)

.010  - 36

.016  - 32

.024  - 28

.035  - 22

.050  - 16

.063  - 11

.078  - 5

Note:  There is no material to speak of left in the thickness of the tip for opening more.  Im somewhat boxed in.  There is a thick tip rail that can be shaved to shorten the piece.  It was never finished into baffle.  Frankly I would like a little more baffle.

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>You can try to "pull" the curve inside the existing curve by lengthening
the facing or opening the tip.  Maybe flattening the table at a slight
angle - to close up the tip and shorten the facing - will give you some
room to then lengthen/open.  Sounds like you have nothing to lose - maybe
you can come up with a curve that makes it playable.  Can it be opened to
.095"?  This might work:

 .0015 48.0  .010   37.4  .016   32.8  .024   27.9  .035   22.3  .050

There are some mouthpieces that just can not be fixed.  I had a Link tenor presented to me that was such a piece.  Apparently the tip opening was too much for the player, and someone MILLED the table until the tip opening was about .060".  No attempt to make a nice curve, there was just a kink where the milling stopped and the old curve began.  There was not enough thickness at the tip to do anything with it.  

I returned it to the owner with the suggestion of using it for a fishing weight or any other use he could find, but it could not be made into a playable mouthpiece.

Sometimes it happens this way and despite your skill, despite how much you want to, it just can&#39;t be fixed.

            <pre class='message__body'>Years back I was given a no-name brass alto m/p in a similar condition. The
table had been milled away until there was pretty well no tip opening and
nothing to work with. As a technical exercise I decided to make it play. I
milled the table completely flat up to the edge of the tip rail. I then made
up a piece of eighth brass plate the shape of the table and rails and hard
soldered it onto the table. I then machined that back to the profile I
wanted, with a medium tip opening and a nice curve. It would never have won
a beauty contest but with a bit of fine-tuning it played OK. I didn&#39;t play
much sax at the time, so I passed it on to a friend who did. He liked it, so
it&#39;s probably still out there somewhere. I was in the Air Force at the time,
so I had access to their machine shop facilities. I wouldn&#39;t ever try it as
a commercial proposition, it took far too long to ever make money out of it,
but as an exercise it was challenging and fun.

I still usually try to do something for them.  You can try trimming back the tip a lot to recover some thickness to work with. But the bite plate pocket or slot can limit what you can do.  I have trimmed hacked Dukoffs 1/4" to make players out of them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Shortening the piece is about the best plan I can come up with too.  I can take off more than 1.5 mm and still have a tip rail.  If I reface it after that I will have a little to add to the piece.  I will also be making the facing shorter which will give a little more punch.  While Id really like more baffle it does have a nice sound.  The bite plate is not in the way of shortening.

Sad thing is that this was a good vintage piece until Egor the butcher got his hands on it.  I d like it to play its best.

I will do some more pondering.  Im picking it up in a trade but even so I dont want to get burned.

Thanks Gents.

I just uploaded a picture of what I do with junker mouthpieces.  Cut the
table side off and epoxy a clothespin into it.  Great for outdoor gigs!
