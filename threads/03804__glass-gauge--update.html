  No need anymore to indicate what you want ahead of time.  From previous
  posts, I&#39;ve learned that interest is split 50-50 between the Set-Back and
  Edge-Zero styles.  Only Merlin indicated that he wanted a narrow stlye gage
  (I doubt that I can honor that request, sorry).  I plan to get 50 of each
  style made so I should have twice the amount needed to fill orders.  

  My specs for the glass etching call for the lines to be .005" deep and wide

  The glass will be 1" x 4" x 3/16" thick with .020" chamfered edges.  It is
