            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone else noticed that when you smack the ring of a mouthpiece shank on your palm, the mouthpiece emits a fixed pitch?

There has got to be a sympathetic relationship between the resonance or vibration of the mouthpiece and fixed resonance of the body tube.  Good topic for discussion or investigation. The electronic tuner would yield which pitch the mouthpiece is inclined towards and the body tube is either Bb or Eb in most cases.

            <pre class='message__body'>That pitch is the resonant frequency of the cavity. It is related to the Frs that we keep talking about.

 Ideally the resonant frequency of the mpc should be the same as that of the missing part of the cone, but you can&#39;t just measure the mpc without the reed and with the extra length of the shank and without the end of the neck there, so the pitch that you hear is useless practically, but related to
 the resonant frequency we are interested in.
