I&#39;m still gathering the tools I&#39;ll need to measure and reface and I&#39;m 
wondering what folks are using to meausre tip opening.
Paul was nice enough to give me the number for Madison Enterprises, the 
company that makes the Winslow kit, but they aren&#39;t planning to make or ship 
any new kits for over a month. Likewise, the Morgan kit also seems to be in 
short supply. I&#39;m wondering if I can just use a set of calipers to make this 
measurement and be just as happy??

Any suggestions?

TIA,

Keith

            <pre class='message__body'>Chech the Photos Guaging area on the Mouthpiece Work Yahoo site to 
see examples of several tip measuring methods.  I used calipers as 
shown in one of the photos for over a year.  I&#39;m now prefering the 
machinist depth gauge.  Its less tricky than holding a MP, glass 
gauge and calipers all at once.

Start with calipers to get going.

Where did you buy the depth gauge? And how much did it cost?

Thanks much,
Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>I got my Depth Gauge off of eBay.  Most of them have 4" long bases.  The 6"
long base ones do not come up very often and they fetch a higher price. 
But you still should be able to get one at less than half price of new if
you are patient.

The most common brand is Starrett.  You dont need a full set of extensions
with it (they are for measuring deeper holes), just a flush one.

McMaster-Carr has them new as #2051A53 
Starrett Depth Micrometer 0-9" Range, 6" Base Length, #445Dz-9Rl 
$ 268.00 Each

You may be able to borrow one off of a machinist to see if you like it
before investing in one.  You can also get the base with one side lopped
off.  Phil Barone said he uses one like that.  It saves some weight, but I
do not have a problem with mine.
