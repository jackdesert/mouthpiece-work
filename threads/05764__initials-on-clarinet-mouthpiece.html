Joe allard is actually one of the most famous saxophone teacher in  
the jazz world
(people like Coleman Hawkins, Dave Liebmann, etc had lessons with Joe).
you can google a bit and find out about his teaching theories.
I think he&#39;s the one to check out for jazz player.

I just had a quick search on Google before your reply and was puzzeled
to work out how did he had time to do any refacing!. I&#39;m sure you are 
correct in saying that he did not reface the mouthpiece himself.

Thank you for sharing your knowledge, now I need to buy you two
