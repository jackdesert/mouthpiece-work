            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone have experience working with Buescher alto mouthpieces? 
Specifically I&#39;m wondering what aspect can cause the slight buzz in
the sound?  My guess is that it has to do with the thin tip rail.

            <pre class='message__body'>What brand & strength reeds are you using on it?  Stock facing?

            <pre class='message__body'>I use 3 1/2 to 4 strength Vandoren&#39;s.  Stock facing; not quite sure. 
It doesn&#39;t look like it has been opened up, tip opening is fairly
close, somewhere around .045 I think.  I had it measured by Ronald
Caravan when I studied with him, I will have to look up the numbers.

            <pre class='message__body'>Many of the Buescher alto m/p&#39;s are actually marked as having a .055" 
tip opening.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have noticed that marking on the Buescher Tru-Lay mouthpieces (I
have one, which ironically measures somewhere in the .060&#39;s, probably
was worked on) but the one in question doesn&#39;t have this marking.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well then the "buzz" aint from soft reeds.  It could possibly be from a
flat section in the facing curve near the tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks. I will check that out, though I&#39;m still new to this so I will
have to figure out about checking for flat spots in the facing. Does
the tip rail play a role is creating a buzz?

            <pre class='message__body'>I doubt the tip rail could be the problem.  Is it thick or thin (like .020"
wide)? 

It is difficult to measure flat sections in the tip area.  You can get a
general impression by looking at light reflections off the tip rail.
