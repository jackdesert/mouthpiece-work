I know auctions aren&#39;t normally posted here, but I thought this 
auction of mine might be of interest.  This is the manual that used 
to come with Erick Brand&#39;s refacing kits.  It is the same as the 
chapter in the Instrument Repairing Manual, except it also contains 
more than 170 Lay schedules for vintage clarinet and saxophone 
mouthpieces.  Feel free to contact me directly with questions at 
phil_brewer@...

The link is show below.  The item number is 3773904572

Thanks

Phil
