            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m going to go ahead and buy a bunch of sets of:
.035, .050, .063, .078, .093, .109, .125 in a 1/2" X 3" format carbon 
steel. All the other sizes can be obtained much cheaper in the mass 
production sets at auto supply stores. 
The stainless is way too expensive (>2X). 
These will be real nice, 
look like real feeler gages, 
and be parallel-sided and accurate to +/-0.0005. I&#39;ll probably put 
them on a key ring or something like that for delivery.

They will probably be closer to $30 a set (I&#39;m just paying time and 
materials), and since you were so supportive, I will discount the 
first 10 or 15 sets to &lt;Mouthpiece Work> members, then post more 
broadly at a higher price, as I will have to sell quite a few to 
recoup my cash outlay.

I will have these in 3-4 weeks...stay tuned!!!

regards, jeff
