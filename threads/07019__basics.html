Is there anywhere on this group or elsewhere one could get the basics of
mouthpiece work including definitions of all the terms (ie rollover,flat
spots, window etc). I have an understanding of most of the lingo but
sometimes doubt my understanding when terms are used certain ways. I see
that Steve has a DVD coming out but I was hoping I could get enough
information to start without laying out that much. I already have most of
the tools etc.Thanks
