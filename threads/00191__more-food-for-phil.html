            <pre class='message__body'>Here are two more, old family recipes...

Caramel Pecan Pie   makes 3 pies

2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup reserved and caramelized
1/2 cup flour
5 egg yolks plus
2 whole eggs
2 1/2 cups whole milk
1 Tablespoon vanilla
1 cup chopped pecans

In top of double boiler, cook 1 1/2 cups sugar, flour, egg yolks, whole
eggs, and mild.  Cook and stir until quite thick.  Add Caramelized
sugar, vanilla, and pecans.  Pour into 3 pie crusts and cook at 350
degrees until pie curst is brown.

This recipe is more than 50 years old.


Chicken Pork and Oyster pie  makes 3 pies or one big pan

1 1/2 pounds pork roast           cut into cubes no larger than 1 inch
1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts     "     "      "      "      "
"     "   "
1 cup finely chopped onion
5-6 green onion
parsley
salt and pepper to taste or Tony&#39;s to taste
1/2 pint oysters, well washed and chopped in small pieces

Make a roux and brown chicken and pork.  Add 1 1/2 cups of water and
then seasoning.  Cook at a slow simmer until very thick (up to 1 1/2
hours).
Add oysters and pour into 3 pie shells and cover with top crust.  Bake
at 350 degrees 45-60 minutes.
Can also be made in one very large pan, double crust.

This recipe came from your Mom&#39;s grandfather Prevost who made it for his
kids to make the meat go further.  More than 100 year old recipe.

Any questions, call your Mom at (and Mom had her phone number here)

(From Paul:  I like to leave out the pork, and increase the oysters and
chicken.  This makes a firm pie you can cut, it will not fall apart.  It
reheats well, and makes  a great entree.)
----
By way of explanation...

A Cajun "roux" differs somewhat from a French "roux".  A French roux is
made by very lightly browning flour in butter, as a base for a white
sauce.

A Cajun roux is made by heating equal parts flour and cooking oil (1
cup/1cup for the above recipe is fine) in a black iron skillet, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon (which will not burn your hand, nothing
magic about the wood) over medium heat.  The flour is browned to a dark
mahogany brown color.  When done, it is immediately removed from heat or
it may burn.  It may be stored unrefrigerated in a mason jar on the
counter, and some spooned into gravies, etc, to thicken various dishes
as needed.

Note, my Great Grandfather was stretching the pork and chicken by adding
oysters... which were easy to come by, but meat was scarce.  A sign of
the times, huh?
