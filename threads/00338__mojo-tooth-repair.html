            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah Keith, what an idea, tell you what, when I recieve those sewed 
up digits in the mail so I can do some flesh epoxy work to cover the 
scars I will return them with my chipped chopper.. 
Actually the chip is on a bit of dental work that can not be filed 
down anymore, I did it by banging into a mic. years ago while playing.
