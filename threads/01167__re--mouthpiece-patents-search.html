            <pre class='message__body'>When anyone asks about patents and patenting, it rings my bell.  I&#39;ve 
searched mp art before and am amazed at the multitude of references found. You can 
make searches via www.USPTO.gov, databases, issued patents, quick search.  I did 
so to see , using [successively] woodwind, saxophone, clarinet, "single reed" 
AND mouthpiece. Each brought up 100+ pats, many duplications as would be 
expected. US 6,501,010 has a very impressive list of cited [prior art] pats, with 
some "famous" names included.  US 5,105,701 Hall/Zinner does have some 
dimensions in its claims, other recent ones also prob. The usual pat "life" is 17/20 
years, so those before 1984 are public property, but before your mfgr/sale, a 
pat attorney&#39;s OK would be recommended. Have fun learning about this funny 
business. Need more?  Don

Patent area on the MPwork site for a few links to get you started.

I am amazed at what is and is not patented.  Some more recent patents 
seem to be awarded for ideas that have been in existence for a long 
time.  I do not know about all the prior art issues, but it seems 
like a lot of what is patented is difficult to enforce.  Guardala 
spent a small fortune defending their design.

            <pre class='message__body'>I know that for Runyon the spoiler insert was patented, as was some of
his machinery.

I don&#39;t think you can patent much else on a mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve got a two volume set of saxophone patents from around the world
which includes many mouthpiece patents. I got it from a guy in Germany.
The title is "Internationale Patentschriften im Holz-und
Metallblasininstrumentenbau Bd. I  & Bd. II" by G. Dullat.  It was very
expensive (&#39;bout $150 as I recall) and I&#39;ll see if I can find some
contact information on the publisher.
