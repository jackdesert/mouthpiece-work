            <pre class='message__body'>Once again, what follows is a reiteration of what I think I&#39;ve read 
here so far.  The main idea behind my doing this remains my concern 
with being sure I&#39;ve pulled together the correct info to begin 
working with.

No attempt has been made to sort through this stuff and determine 
what items may substitute for others on the list nor have I tried to 
even guess at what might be essential for one person and useless for 
another.  I&#39;m mostly interested in getting somewhat of an idea of 
various, reasonable versus hypothetical, possibilities used by those 
of you currently working with MPCs.

The list is alphabetical and no attempts have been made at 
categorizing things I really don&#39;t know enough about to group 
coherently.  For those who already have good ideas about this 
information, please excuse my naivet√© here.  Any errors or
omissions 
are probably the result of my having been a hippie college student in 
the sixties coupled with being a somewhat retired person and 
beginning sax player these days.

Thanks in advance for any feedback, including further clarity or 
details, about this stuff.

Jon Van Wie&#39;s upcoming refacing video, as listed on his website.

There are other videos about sax maintenance and repairs but Jon&#39;s 
work in progress is the only one about mouthpiece work I&#39;ve 
discovered so far.  And, I&#39;ve not gone through the various instrument 
repair manuals for info either.  I am in the process of starting to 
run down published articles about sax and clarinet mouthpieces and 
will be doing what I can through inter-library loans, at least as 
much as I can afford, depending on what other libraries charge for 
photocopies of articles.  If anybody has suggestions beyond the 
articles appearing in Saxophone, they would be most graciously 
appreciated.

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice recap of what is scattered through the postings.  

To your list, I would add some consideration of work space.  A dedicated
workbench would be nice.  I use whatever is available, so tool portability
is important to me.  Most of my tools fit into a briefcase.  This makes for
a quick clean up and organization.

Lighting is a consideration.  Reading the glass gage needs decent lighting.
 Being portable, I have often trouble with this.

Rags.  I use old dish towels to wipe the mouthpiece.

Vacuum.  I do not use it much but I wish it was there when I need it.  The
sandpaper would last longer if the dust was removed.  I also shake out my
rags.  They could be vacuumed.

A notebook/file system is needed.  I store my measurements and log other
notes/observations/analysis.  I have Emails and articles.  Also, and
mouthpiece specs from manufactureres.

Next, you will need to prioritize your list and deal with the redundancy of
some items.  For priorities, I would start with

1. measurement/analysis tools and notebook
2. facing tools (the basic kit stuff)
3. epoxy working (baffles, tip repairs)
4. major chamber work (flex shaft tool)

I kept myself busy for many months just measuring and analyzing every
mouthpiece I could get my hands on.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith.  Your feedback is precisely the kind of help getting 
organized I really need.  Learning to reface and do some basic work 
with MPC&#39;s is shaping up to start around mid-fall, after my outdoor 
concert season ends and before Christmas gigs start rolling in [I&#39;m 
new to being a sax player; it&#39;s a non-revenue generating, retirement 
kind of career for me].  It&#39;s just that I want to start planning now 
and this is a great place to begin doing so!

            <pre class='message__body'>A few more tools I find usefull that are not on your list:

A scriber to mark pieces I worked on.  I use a blue needle spring in 
a pin vise.

A pocketknife.  A small curved blade is good for scraping next to a 
tip rail on hard rubber pieces.

Plastic sticks sold at craft stores to spread glue.  They are white, 
about 3" long with one end flat and square and one end flat and 
round.  I use these to push the steel wool back and forth when I&#39;m 
finishing up the chamber.

Micro-Mark putty knives #60737 and #15131 (larger). I have another 
tool similar to #60738 too.

Auto Polishing Compound #7.  I use it to finish the chamber.

A homemade tool to polish the chamber.  A stick of wood or plastic 
cut at an steel angle with cork, leather, and/or chamois glued to 
it.  Need a small one to do sporanos.

A PC.  I like to plot the facing curves and generate new curves as 
targets.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is great.  My usual notion of pulling together very elementary, 
if not downright primative, lists, like I posted here, is that, for 
myself, I know there are times when it&#39;s very easy to overlook the 
obvious, because I can take something for granted, that another 
person might have to be quite conscious of.

I&#39;ve started browsing eBay for calipers, primarily dial or digital, 
and don&#39;t know the first thing about what good ones are or are not.  
So, I&#39;ve also ordered several tools catalogs:  Ferree&#39;s (in hand 
already), Micro-Mart, and Allied.  My thoughts are to browse whatever 
materials (paper or online catalogs) I can acquire before I start 
accumulating stuff; I&#39;m a pack rat and already have come across 
plenty of mouthpieces, inexpensive ones from garage or similar sales, 
to tinker around with in the beginning.  And, I can borrow some other 
ones from some friends, to measure, as long as that&#39;s all I do with 
them.

The suggestion of spending a great deal of time, especially in the 
beginning, making measurements and training myself to be consistent 
and precise according to whatever assumptions I choose to operate 
with makes a lot of sense and is something I might have jumped over, 
before learning to do this as a result my mistakes.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll 
still have plenty enough opportunities to make some of those anyway.

            <pre class='message__body'>My idea of general tooling is based on machine operator experience.  For any precision measuring device, or any precision bench tooling or machine tools my first choice would be a supplier that is local, and deals in hand tools for machinists, mold makers, mechanics, etc.  There are several brand names available, many imported names and American made.  The best brand by far is the American made Starrett:

http://www.starrett.com/default.htm

There are none made any better.  Pricey and worth it.

Personally, I stay away from any place that markets to the masses.
