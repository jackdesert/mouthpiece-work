            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I swapped mouthpieces with a guy. I gave him a Runyon Smooth Bore 10
which I didn&#39;t like and he gave me a Rovner Deep V 30D "6". My first
impression was a bit disappointing but after playing it for an hour I
realized that the Rovner is a good match for my Buescher True Tone
tenor. High octave plays in tune easily, far better than my other
mouthpieces (Vandoren V16 T77, SR Tech Pro, SR Tech Legend, SR Tech
Fusion, refaced Otto Link STM 7). Also the higher octave sounds fuller
compared with the other mouthpieces. What could be the cause of this
improvement? Is the mouthpiece or is me? Could the 30D be considered
as a big chamber mouthpiece? What do you think about this mouthpiece?
Is it a keeper? The original idea was to sell it but now I don&#39;t know.

Thank you very much in advance,

Luis Pablo

            <pre class='message__body'>If it works for you over the test of time, that is the only answer.
