            <pre class='message__body'>James,

The various ones going around spoof both originating and destination
address, often doinga  mix & match of the username (before the @ ) and the
email domain name (the stuff after the @ ).

As several varities actually have their own email engine, it is rather hard
to sort out where the message actually came from, even with access to system
admin logs.

Noticed your email originally had an attachment?!  Hope nothing viral!!

The authors of these things must be paid to do this stuff - I hope their
reeds squeak .........

email was sent out from the address chnani@..., with the
subject "hi" to MouthpieceWork members. This message is infected with the
W32.Beagle.A@mm virus, in an executable file (nbtbxt.exe). I know it&#39;s quite
late to be saying this, but I suppose it&#39;s better late than never.
