            <pre class='message__body'>In my experience the simple use and handling of a mouthpiece usually is good enough to eliminate most odors and tastes.  It might take a week or so of regular handling but if you can grin and bare it, that very well be all that is needed.  If it is really bad, I would first soak it in distilled water for 24-48 hours and see if this does the trick for you.  If not, then Lemon juice from concentrate is what I use to eliminate calcium deposits...but it works well to reduce the smell and taste as well.  Please note that lemon juice...like the other remidies offered will very likely help make your mouthpiece&#39;s oxidizing color more pronounced.  Finally if you want the help of a Doctor...go to this guy.  He has dedicated a lot of his expertise to the mundane problems we mouthpiecers have.  Perhaps you will like some of his products.  http://www.doctorsprod.com/

  Good luck,

I have advised soaking a mouthpiece in vinegar only for removing white calcified saliva stains.

 I just got a clarinet mouthpiece that seems to be fairly old, and has
that typical (though by no means unbearable) hard rubber odor, as well
as a bit of a taste.  Is there anything that would help with this?

I have had good luck washing them with toothpaste (with mild
abraisives in it) and then coating for several hours inside and out
with olive oil.
I then wipe off/out the olive oil.  From that point on, if the piece
is played and handled regularly, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem.

some French mpc. makers used to store rubber clarinet mpcs. in it to
preserve them. It&#39;s a little pricier, but excellent to use and smells
wonderful as a bonus.

Hi, Geoff!
 
Flitz is a cleaner/polish manufacturer here in the US (go to
www.flitz.com for their site). You should be able to find their
products internationally, especially in gun or sporting shops
(original Flitz is great for stainless steel firearms, and we use it
in the shop for cleaning brass instrument mouthpieces, clarinet keys,
 and such) but they have a variety of products. Another thought are
cleaning polishing products from Meguiar&#39;s at www.meguiar&#39;s.com. I
used to get a wonderful product of theirs for cleaning and polishing
pickguards on guitars and other plastic and rubber products that
worked better than Flitz and was nearly non-abrasive, but don&#39;t see it
listed any more. 

The only thing like Flitz I&#39;ve seen is Wenol, which seems to be an
international product as well. These products have never caused any
damage to any hard rubber mouthpieces I have used it on, they are
extremely low-abrasive. But then again I have a few very old pieces,
like my Kaspars and a Kaspar-made Goldbeck and such that oxidize
easily if not used occasionally, and I don&#39;t use it on them repeatedly
for fear of eventually damaging them. The Flitz works well as a
first-time  and then occasional oxidation remover, used sparingly
(that&#39;s as about as close to a disclaimer as I can get). As I
mentioned you should carefully then wash and rinse the piece as has
been explained here in the past. It doesn&#39;t leave any odor or residue,
but using mouthwash sparingly if you prefer will only make sure of
this for you.

Hope this helps.

Don
