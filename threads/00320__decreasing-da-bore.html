            <pre class='message__body'>Hey guys,
I really appreciate all of the wonderful response you have given to 
me. Let me just say first to those of you that were kind enough to 
suggest only using one mouthpiece etc. I have been playing for over 4 
decades with many of the best known bands around and while just a 
sideman, I have a really good understanding of sound, tone, 
embouchure and mainly because my main horn is bari, I am very adept 
at doubling and making fast changes, almost in the same category as 
Mojo who floored me one time while I sat next to him in a section and 
out of nowhere he pulled out a HUGE train whistle to 
underscore "Chatanooga Choo Choo" to this day I still break up 
thinking about that one, now THAT is doubling...
Seriously I know about changing mouthpieces but what I said here is I 
found a piece that I really want to use occasionally, my regular 
piece which happens to be a Lamberson 7M hard rubber bari piece is 
almost just like the best sounding NY Meyer ever but there are times 
when I want something a bit different, not bolder, edgier or broader, 
just a bit different and here it is but I do not want to go nuts with 
corks and gizmo&#39;s. Last night on a gig I realized my friend, some of 
you may know him, Hans Muhler formerly the head Yamaha tech in NYC 
was on the gig playing trombone. I asked about your suggestions and 
he took the mouthpiece, will be making measurements and installing a 
brass or silver sleeve for me.. Thanks to all of you for the 
wonderful response, it is very much appreciated and to Mojo Keith 
fingers for starting such a nice group. I have one more question, how 
come there does not seem to be any mouthpiece "action" such as 
trading etc. going on within the group? Have I broached a taboo topic?

It&#39;s because we are all mouthpiece hogs... we buy &#39;em, we don&#39;t sell
&#39;em.  The mouthpieces we don&#39;t think are great players, we don&#39;t sell
&#39;em, we hack on them until they do play, or they are too far gone to be
anything but a doorstop.

Well, I am just talking about me.  No one else in this group is this
crazy.  I don&#39;t think.  Well, maybe.

Hey guys,
I really appreciate all of the wonderful response you have given to 
me. Let me just say first to those of you that were kind enough to 
suggest only using one mouthpiece etc. I have been playing for over 4 
decades with many of the best known bands around and while just a 
sideman, I have a really good understanding of sound, tone, 
embouchure and mainly because my main horn is bari, I am very adept 
at doubling and making fast changes, almost in the same category as 
Mojo who floored me one time while I sat next to him in a section and 
out of nowhere he pulled out a HUGE train whistle to 
underscore "Chatanooga Choo Choo" to this day I still break up 
thinking about that one, now THAT is doubling...
Seriously I know about changing mouthpieces but what I said here is I 
found a piece that I really want to use occasionally, my regular 
piece which happens to be a Lamberson 7M hard rubber bari piece is 
almost just like the best sounding NY Meyer ever but there are times 
when I want something a bit different, not bolder, edgier or broader,

            <pre class='message__body'>Brian,
Nice to hear that you&#39;ve found someone that understands the care 
required to do the modifications.

As for a taboo topic... Not that I&#39;m aware of. Personally, I think 
it&#39;s helping to secure in my mind (through thinking more about the 
topic) that I&#39;m better off with the one mouthpiece. And I&#39;m sure that 
others (through thinking about the topic) will be more firmly 
convinced that having several set-ups is the way to go. If you (or 
anyone else) want to have several set-ups, then that&#39;s fine - as long 
as you&#39;re well aware of the possible problems associated with it 
(just as I&#39;m aware of the possible problems associated with using 
just the one set-up). Besides... Sometimes I like to be the 
figurative "devil&#39;s advocate" (this isn&#39;t just in terms of sax tone, 
etc) just to make people think more about what they do (not saying 
that anyone here hasn&#39;t thought about what they do - being on this 
list is proff that everyone here *does* think about what they do).
;-)

Anyway, I hope that you have plenty of enjoyment playing your new 
mouthpiece.
:-)

Although I&#39;m going to sell my metal mouthpiece, because it&#39;s worth 
more to me as $ in the bank (or new pads on the horn) than as a door 
stop. However, I have attacked the mouthpiece I bought with the 
horn... But plastic is a bit too light-weight to use as an effective 
door stop...
