            <pre class='message__body'>We&#39;ve decided to expand our little empire a bit and make a few  
changes. We are interested in setting up a few dealers outside the USA  
and China, particularly in the following locations:
Germany, South America, Australia, England, Scandinavia,Japan, Korea,  
Israel, South Africa, or really anywhere in Europe. I&#39;m really  
interested in talking to anyone anywhere outside of the USA and China.

We are only interested in talking with experienced music industry  
folks who will get behind our products and promote them. We are NOT in  
the dealer financing business, that&#39;s what banks are for. We also only  
interested in dealers who will carry our full line of products and  
accessories. Since we rid ourselves of corporate entanglements a few  
years ago, our sales have doubled every year. We provide attractive  
pricing and advertising support for qualified dealers. We&#39;re doing  
fine right now, but will be willing to take on qualified dealers who  
are true believers in our products and philosophy.

If you or someone you know has an interest, contact me PRIVATELY at saxgourmet@...
