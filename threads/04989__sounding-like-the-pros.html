            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve had a couple of clients come to me before and say, "Man can you 
just make me sound like Brecker, or Sanborn?" uh.................NO!
The problem is......ok say for instance you want to sound like 
sanborn, the first thing is do is buy a dukoff. (Mistake #1).  You 
have to understand sanborn didn&#39;t start off playing dukoff&#39;s. You 
would probably be better in your attempt at this sound if you started 
off using an old level aire brilhart like he did.Or take Brecker for 
example. I think people that buy Guardala&#39;s just to sound like 
Brecker have no idea about sound concept.  Brecker played on a link 
for all those years (during the70&#39;s), and that fatten his throat up 
enormously. Then he went to the high baffle ( were all familiar with 
today ), and could conpensate for it. Just because someone has a 
Katana thats folded 12 more times than yours, does not make them a 
better samuari.  Sound is voice, and voice is expression, and 
expression is spiritual. Play what you feel, and then you will sound 
like the 
greats.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had read an interview with Michael Brecker in which he said he ended up sounding the same no matter what mouthpiece he used, but due to a neck injury, he looked for a mouthpiece that was easy for him to play.

            <pre class='message__body'>Amen.  You got to practice and listen to tons  of
music, spend YEARS being dedicated, and then maybe you
can call yourself a musician.

Peace,
