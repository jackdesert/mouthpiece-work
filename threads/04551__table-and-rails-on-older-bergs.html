            <pre class='message__body'>almost all older rubber bergs i see have a "bumpy" (looks like several 
small ridges across the mouthpiece)table and rails almost all the way 
up to the tip. does anyone know the reasoning behind this? was it done 
intentionally?  you always see people talking about a smooth 
table/rails etc but these pieces seem to play fine. thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not think this is a design feature.  These are just ridges from
machining the table and the facing.  If they get too larger, some air leaks
out the side rails.  They are an indication that no hand finishing was done
to the table and side rails.

But play testing is the ultimate test.
