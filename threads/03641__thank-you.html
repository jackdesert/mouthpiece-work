            <pre class='message__body'>Just want to thank you Keath for an awesom site. I&#39;ve learned so much 
from all of you. Been trying my hand at refacing for about 3 or 4 yrs 
w/no results. Until I stumbled on to you guys. You&#39;ve answered all my 
questions and set me on fire. I wish there was something I could 
contribute for all you&#39;ve done for me. Thanks again! Jerry
