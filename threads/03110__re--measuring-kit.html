Having caught up on the posts at last, I feel I should try to repay
those wonderful people who have given us thier knowledge so freely, by
trying to give Alex and other newcomers the benefit of my limited
experience.

I made up my own refacing kit. The Dial Gauge (N.B. English spelling
Keith) was second hand on Ebay UK tools section for £5.
The bracket to attach the gauge too, was an alloy rafter tri-square
cut down to 4"x5"
     See http://www.saxmania.com/TheSax/SaxResources/Refacing/ 
         Thanks Guto
The Glass Gauge is an on going problem for me. The popular Babbitt
gauge  or any other for that matter, is not available here in the UK.
I won&#39;t go into detail unless it is asked for but my glass gauge is
made from picture glass off cuts and a clear Acrylic ruler scale glued
on top.
      After all refacing is a hands on, skilled, DIY job, so why not
make up your own tool kit and it&#39;s cheaper.    Eddie

I think the best way is to assemble your own tools individually.  There are
a lot of posts in the archives on this and some files and links on the
Yahoo site to help.
