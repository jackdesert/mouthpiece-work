Yahoo has been tweeking their Spam filter. I do not know why you test 
message got through but not your other posts. I just saw you had 2 
posts tagged as possible spam. I released on and deleted the other. 
I&#39;ll have to see if I can turn the filter off. We really do not need 
it since I delete spammers when I find them.
