            <pre class='message__body'>Karsten, for whatever reason, some posts via the groups groups (and not just mouthpiecework) get delayed, sometimes several days or even a week.  I don&#39;t know if it is yahoo, or some other problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yahoo has been tweeking their Spam filter.  I do not know why you test 
message got through but not your other posts.  I just saw you had 2 
posts tagged as possible spam.  I released on and deleted the other.  
I&#39;ll have to see if I can turn the filter off.  We really do not need 
it since I delete spammers when I find them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Keith,
                 Thanks - I had a feeling that something out of the ordinary
was going on. I suppose the spam filter was set a bit too high - mistaking
sax for another popular pastime. :)
