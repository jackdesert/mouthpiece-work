            <pre class='message__body'>I have a fat vintage Bundy bari mouthpiece with a very large chamber.  On the side someone 
has engraved the word "Gregory".  Any ideas on this strange addition?  I have many similar 
bari mpc marked Geo. M Bundy and Gale and Eagle and some unmarked.  

I&#39;m sure many of you have seen or owned these jawbreakers.  I would  like to squeeze as 
much sound quality out of these pieces and I want to start with the "Gregory."  Has any one 
worked on this type of mpc?  Any suggestions?

Jim
