            <pre class='message__body'>Wishing to extend my relaying experience to metal without destroying a
good &#39;piece, I invested in a Glodstar tenor replica of a Selmer Jazz.
This is sold on eBay U.K. for 35GBP and comes in a Selmer lookalike
box with deliberate spelling changes to overcome copyright enfringements.
Complete with ligature and cap in sLiver or gLod plate. 8# = Selmer F
I could&#39;nt get a sound out of it until I flattened the table.
Its fairly well finished but the rails had to be narrowed and the tip
was rather square.
I put on a Link facing from the files section (thanks Keith) and I am
very pleased with the results.
I would recommend this as a cheap blank.
Has anyone tried the RED DRAGON, another larruping &#39;piece which will
bring long life and much happiness ?  :)

I forgot to mention, the Glodstar seems to be made of brass.
The U.S. price is also about half what it is here in the U.K.
The ligature is the original Selmer design.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Gian glad to hear that you liked the mouthpieces. On one of them 
the lig was great the other was not as good.Here&#39;s a tip my Oleg 
mouthpiece that I refaced and was playing great. Then I did a little 
more to it and mess it up. I was sick it took major work to get it to 
play well again.You got to know when to stop and not go for that 
little bit more.Has anyone else had this problem?---------------------
