Maybe someone knows.

Does anyone have information on an old 1960&#39;s double banded otto link 
Super Tone Tenor Florida Mouthpiece. On one side of the table is 
marked 5*, of course that is the facing, which was the standard facing 
for the era. On the other side it is marker H23. I assume this might 
be the serial number, but I am not sure.

Maybe someone knows.
