As we approach our 3rd anniversary of existence as a Yahoo Group (on 
3/13), I like to reflect on the past year at MouthpieceWork.  

For one, I think Yahoo has done a nice job of giving us a free place 
to gather.  It has been a reliable and easy site to manage.  If I 
knew whom to thank, I would.

As for group activity, its been great.  In our 3rd year we have 
ascended from merely exchanging electronic helps via the web to 
exchanging hardware developed by and for our comrades.  Last April we 
were receiving our large sizes feeler gauges from Jeff Rosner.   
Thanks to Jeff, life got better.   Later in the year we pooled out $ 
and ordered brass mouthpiece blanks from eMachineShop that I designed 
using their software.  Recently, Steve Fowler developed a dial tip 
opening gauge and sold it to us at a discount.

I think this past year is going to be a tough act to follow!
