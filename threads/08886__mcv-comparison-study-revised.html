            <pre class='message__body'>Using wooden beads on a cable I was able to get a more accurate neck
length measurement from 173 mm to 176 mm
Using a graduated cylinder the measured volume inside the neck was
measured at 50 ml as opposed to 49 ml
The greatest change was recalculating the effective volume of the
mouthpiece with it 28.2 mm onto the cork instead of 10 mm
It was found to add exactly 2.26 ml when placed  28.2 mm onto the cork
compared  to  2.38 ml when placed at 10 mm.
As a result the 28.2 mm was added to the measured mouthpiece volume in

Using a graduated cylinder the measured volume inside the neck was measured
at 50 ml as opposed to 49 ml
The greatest change was recalculating the effective volume of the mouthpiece
with it 28.2 mm onto the cork instead of 10 mm
It was found to add exactly 2.26 ml when placed  28.2 mm onto the cork

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Toby,

The point is:

-To find an effective way to calculate the length and volume of the
missing cone that can apply to all saxophones.

-To investigate how the "effective" volume of a mouthpiece compares to
its measured physical volume.

-To calculate the Frs of the neck + missing cone

-To compare the played frequency of the neck + mouthpiece with the
calculated frequency of the neck + missing cone

-To investigate ways to make the played Frs match the calculated Frs
without changing a good match between calculated missing cone volume and
effective mouthpiece volume.

My opinion is that we should not be satisfied just knowing that a given
mouthpiece (or neck) solves the intonation problems on a given
saxophone.  It is important to know why it works in order to transfer
that understanding to other situations.

I&#39;m actually leaning toward Santy Runyon&#39;s mouthpiece pitch concepts as
the most effective way to match Frs when the volumes are the same.  I
believe Santy was right, but not for the reasons he gave at the time
which have turned out to be false.

I find it puzzling that in light of your earlier response (below) to my
very legitimate questions directed to you about your experience with the
acoustics of necks and mouthpieces, that you are now wanting to
participate in a new discussion with me and ask me questions.  That
represents a very obvious inconsistency to say the least.

That said, I will answer your question in the hopes that you will answer
mine and share some of your knowledge gained by designing necks and
mouthpieces since you are the expert on this forum.

The following investigation of an SBA alto neck should answer your
questions about the taper calculations used in the other studies.

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

While I agree that these are noble goals, the elephant in
the room is that reed parameters that have nothing to do
with any of this have a very large impact on the final
pitch of any given note, and therefore throw a giant
monkey wrench into any hope of reaching these goals with
numbers alone. Benade himself hints at the fact that
"normal embouchure" has wide variation, and this has a
major impact on your Frs, as well as mpc volume. This is
not to mention that different reed strengths and even
different lays have a large effect on the lowering of the
tube resonances. This means that different players playing
different reeds would all need a different mpc volume,
just for starters.

And, as soon as one moves the mpc even slightly from the
measured position, all your numbers get thrown way off,
and this is often absolutely necessary to compensate for
temperature effects.

How do you propose to make use of your theory in light of
those facts?

BTW, you may find this interesting. I don&#39;t know why the
formulae are obscured, but this touches on many of the
factors that I mention, plus giving you some hints about
artificial embouchures:

"Some aspects of tuning and clean intonation in reed
instruments."

http://perso.univ-lemans.fr/~jgilbert/ArticlesPageWeb/AppliedAc1995.pdf

While I agree that ballpark figures can indicate
tendencies, there is a limit to just how much what you are
working so hard to quantify is actually applicable in
real-world situations, given the great number of other
factors that come into play. Note in the end part of the
paper that there is a discussion about inharmonicity, and
how that can generally be minimized if the top of the cone
is narrowed. This seems to be done as a matter of course
(I believe Steve touched on this in at least one post),
and this alone would throw off your volume calculations if
they are based simply on the ratio of the diameters of the
two ends of the truncated cone.

Of course, how you spend your time is your own business
;-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Toby for that wonderful link.  It is too bad the actual figures
(illustrations) are not included from that source.

I agree with what you said.  However seeking a better understanding of
how the entire "system" actually works is a laudable goal in itself even
if there is no commercial or immediate practical application.   I have
never the type of person who is  content to just know that something
works.  I have always needed to know why it works as well.

The variables of the player&#39;s embouchure pressure, blowing pressure,
reed strength, etc. are all certainly factors that have an impact on the
volume and played frequency of the missing cone.  Along with that is the
facing and tip opening of the mouthpiece and its interior volume as
well.  I am convinced that there are some important relationships among
all of these that can be identified and used to help solve tuning and
intonation problems involved with using different set-ups.

Thanks again for that link.  In my estimation Gilbert, Dalmont,
Nederveen, and Wolfe are the new generation&#39; s version of Coltman,
Fletcher, and Benade in the field of musical acoustics.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thank Google for the link. I came across it while
researching my diatribe against putting too much stock in
simple mpc volume and Frs.
It appears that the sax tunes mostly by mpc volume (or so
it seems from my informal research: I can so far find no
clear link between mpc length and tuning--contrary to my
arguments long ago on SOTW), I think that you would do
well to turn your attention to trying to establish a link
between those two parameters. Taking Paul&#39;s example, you
might put inserts of graduated sizes in a mpc (as you did
before), retune the lower octave and see what the
relationship is with the second mode. If we could get a
reasonable idea of how length from neck end to reed tip
(with correct internal volume as per position on neck)
affect the mode relationships it would be valuable. There
doesn&#39;t seem to be a really practical method of varying
Frs on the sax keeping the internal volume correct (unless
you change or shorten the neck). Any change to the mpc
entails a volume change, so as soon as you compensate for
that you are generally back to where you started. It
appears that the length/volume ratio is about the only
feasible parameter to vary on a mpc. Scavone mentions that
there are timbre differences between a mpc with a long
thin and short fat chamber, but he did not investigate
mode relationships, apparently.

A rather limited outlook....

On one end of the market, you may have someone designing a mouthpiece for mass appeal, that will work on any horn, played by any player, of any skill level, with any reed and concept of style.   

On the other end is perhaps someone concerned only with exclusive, high-end applications of the art, designing one particular mouthpiece for one individual player of exceptional artistry, playing one particular instrument, with one consistent reed type, and one particular artistic concept.

Then there could also be the talented player, who&#39;s only concern is designing the ultimate mouthpiece for their own use.

These are very different objectives with very different design parameters.  I&#39;m hesitant to assume that everyone has the same goals.

Is someone willing to try this on some working models?

            <pre class='message__body'>Ross,

I think it&#39;s not quite that simple. The embouchure tension
changes both the reed impedance and the volume under the
reed, which must be figured in the internal volume of the
mpc. The reed impedance has a varying effect on intonation
depending on the strength of the horn impedances. If there
are really strong peaks then the reed gets locked into the
horn resonance and can&#39;t change it too much (try lipping
the bell notes of the low octave), but in the shorter tube
notes and the second register the reed impedance has a
much stronger effect.

I&#39;ve noticed on my old Selmer Super alto that there is a
big problem between E and D--very sharp in the second
register. Somebody made a reducing ring for the D tonehole
many years ago, which helps D somewhat but makes it very
flat then in the low octave. No way the mpc is going to
help that.

One problem that you will surely run into has to do with
ambient temperature. Play in the cold and you will have to
push the mpc in. This will reduce volume and make the
notes increasingly sharp the higher you go. And the
temperature differential on a cold day between the short
and long tube notes could get up around ten cents.

My little informal experiments so far point to the fact
that mpc length has little to do with register intonation.
Leaving aside temperature effects for the moment, you will
naturally push on the mpc until the internal volume is in
the ballpark--which makes the horn play in tune for the
most part. If the mpc has a larger chamber you will push
it on farther. A smaller chamber will make you pull it off
farther, until the volumes are just about equal for a
given sounding pitch. 

With a couple of different mpcs, I found about a 1 cm
difference in total length from end of neck to tip rail
(the big chamber one being pushed on much farther), and
that didn&#39;t seem to make a big difference in the tuning
across the registers. I also filled a small-chamber piece
with clay until to tune correctly it was almost falling
off the neck, and that seems to have made the upper note
about 10 cents sharp, but that was a radical change, and a
slightly smaller clay insert did not seem to have the same
effect.

The point I was trying to make in earlier posts is that
because it is so easy to tune most notes (especially in
the second register) using mouth tension alone (and we all
do this unconsciously all the time unless we are tone
deaf), it is very difficult to actually find the effect of
these profile changes in mpcs without the use of an
artificial embouchure, which is less smart than we are
(sometimes not by much) and cannot compensate. 

The embouchure is dynamic: it is not a fixed proposition,
and we all use our embouchures to correct intonation and
for expressive purposes anyway. These volume mismatches
which throw out the octaves are usually pretty much
progressive, and thus we simply get used to adjusting
embouchure (which we have to do anyway when we change
dynamics) to hit the correct pitch center, just as a
violin player learns (in the absence of frets) just where
to put the fingers to get the correct pitch.

Much more insidious is mistuning between notes, because it
is difficult to adjust the embouchure that quickly. But as
long as the intonation problems are progressive, we just
adjust unconsciously as we play.

I have been listening carefully to a lot of music lately,
and I can recognize that many passing notes are well
beyond 20 cents off. We easily accept that unless there
are instruments in unison or a long note is held that is
that far off intonationally. As long as the
instrumentalist is able to land on pitch in critical
moments, we do not notice.

There was an interesting study done on what it means to be
"in the groove" rhythmically. It turns out that perfect
timing does not make the groove, imperfect timing
does--timing that threatens to disintegrate, but manages
to keep it together is felt to be in the groove. It is
tricky: if the timing is too perfect it is simply
mechanical, if it is too far out it is sloppy, but there
is a "sweet spot" in which it has character, and the fact
that it hits the beat right while almost not hitting it
right is what gives it dynamism.

I might argue that the same is true intonationally.
"Singing" has got to be the small variations in pitch that
always seem to find the right center; but it is the
inconsistency which gives the flavor. This is why a synth
can sound so sterile. It may well be that at a certain
level, the quest for perfect intonation is
counterproductive; what gives the feeling of mastery and
expression is the fact that an instrumentalist has control
of the pitch and can ride it well. If the pitch has
control, and it is out, that is awful. If the pitch has
control and it is perfect, that is boring.

FWIW,

Toby

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

I believe that I can eventually find a way to prove that even though
changes in the embouchure pressure on the reed do change the effective
volume somewhat,  that the change in the Frs (frequency of the
mouthpiece and neck) is proportionately greater than just that change in
the mouthpiece volume alone.

That would mean  that the mouthpiece pitch concept espoused by Santy
Runyon, Eugene Rousseau, et al has an important acoustic basis, that
being a way to match the the played Frs of the mouthpiece and neck with
the calculated resonant frequency of the neck plus the missing cone. 
This would then fulfill one of Benade&#39;s two requirements for a conical
woodwind "to work properly".

This all begins to make sense when the mouthpiece is set on the cork to
play low B and  its first two overtones  B2 and F#2 in tune and then the
mouthpiece and neck are removed and the player then fine tunes the
embouchure to produce a perfect Ab concert on the neck and mouthpiece
alone, and then checks the pitch of the low B with that same embouchure.

This may take some going back and forth at first, but when both tuning
conditions are met using exactly the same embouchure, then everything
else in the saxophone&#39;s scale and octaves are the best they can be
within the design of that instrument.  This has been my experience, and
now I believe I understand the acoustic theory as to why it works. From
there as you say the musician takes over and makes small nuanced pitch
adjustments through careful listening---but does not have to work nearly
as hard as he would if those volume and Frs requirements are not met.

I am first and foremost a teacher, and I can see the pedagogical
importance to this type of study and research as well as its application
to design.

"While I agree that these are noble goals,.....different players playing
different reeds would all need a different mpc volume, just for starters."

A rather limited outlook....

On one end of the market, you may have someone designing a mouthpiece for
mass appeal, that will work on any horn, played by any player, of any skill
level, with any reed and concept of style.   

On the other end is perhaps someone concerned only with exclusive, high-end
applications of the art, designing one particular mouthpiece for one
individual player of exceptional artistry, playing one particular
instrument, with one consistent reed type, and one particular artistic
concept.

Then there could also be the talented player, who&#39;s only concern is
designing the ultimate mouthpiece for their own use.

These are very different objectives with very different design parameters.
I&#39;m hesitant to assume that everyone has the same goals.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, I suppose I should rephrase what I said: I couldn’t maintain my current standard of living if I had to rely on making custom mouthpieces only, and charge what the work is worth. I don’t think the super premium price bracket is there in sufficient numbers for anyone to make a good living. It’s another one of those thing there is a lot of talk and dreaming about, but not a huge number of people actually writing checks. Even if you had the entire market to yourself, I don’t think there is really that much money to be made.

 

The most expensive mouthpiece we sell is priced at $400, the vast majority of our mouthpiece products are less than $200.

We sold slightly less than a thousand mouthpieces at retail worldwide last (2009) year. Do the math. We feel like we have the market figured out, at least to our satisfaction. To generate the same sort of revenue stream with a totally handmade custom made to order product makes little sense to us. A product of this nature would be very time consuming to make, and the numbers just aren’t there. I note with interest that almost none of the highly skilled and well recognized mouthpiece refacers have chosen to enter this market. They are apparently able to do the math.  Hand making custom mouthpieces would also require us to neglect the other aspects of our business such as saxophones, necks, and other accessories. We enjoy the mouthpiece business, and it is very profitable for us, but it represents a small portion of our company sales.

 

I feel that if we were to elect to enter the custom mouthpiece market, we could be as successful as anybody. That market just doesn’t appeal to us.

Don&#39;t forget that Frs affects the intonation of the higher
notes only. For sax that would mean starting around high B
(I guess) and going up into the palms.

Also, Frs is determined by the shape and volume of the mpc
and the constriction. It is not changed but very slightly
by changing the volume under the reed by changing
embouchure pressure. It has nothing at all to do with reed
impedance.

I think you are barking up a very wrong tree.

In his Stanford class notes, page 21, Benade puts the mouthpiece/constriction resonance frequency as being in the area of the 2nd-mode frequency of the shortest used tube.  On a tenor with an F# key, that would be the top F# tone hole, overblown, or a concert E (1318.56Hz).  That would put the displacement anti-node of that resonance, which he calls frs, just inside the neck opening.  The actual mouthpiece+ entire neck resonance for a tenor, as John advocates, is a concert E (659.28Hz), an octave lower.  Do you see the contradiction?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Lance,

I&#39;m assuming (perhaps wrongly) that since oboes and
bassoons don&#39;t have palm keys, he is talking about C# more
or less, but I put it a tad lower for conservatism. 

AFAIK all Benade is saying about Frs is that if you play
the same frequency as the neck/mpc Frs, that the node
should be at the same place (end of the neck) as it is
when you play the combo off the horn. Since there is no
tone hole at the neck, that would mean playing a note with
a tube length twice that of what would be the length of
the untruncated neck, and cutting it in half with the
register key to get a center pressure node. 

There is no contradiction if you realize that the Frs in
question (to affect the higher resonances) is that of the
mpc alone (with suitable constriction), because the neck
is already a cone and therefore won&#39;t screw up the modes
where it is in play. You need to consider mpc Frs, not
mpc/neck Frs to know where the effect is going to kick in.
Considering mpc/neck Frs will give you an idea about how
well the modes should be aligned for a played note around
that frequency, if I am not mistaken.

Actually, looking at it that way (and assuming that even
with the constriction the mpc Hh resonance is somewhat
higher than that which you get blowing across it with the
complete shank, which I think is a safe assumption), it
appears that indeed the effective Hh resonance of the mpc
with constriction diameter would be right up around C or
so. I&#39;m not willing to cut up a mpc to find out, though...

            <pre class='message__body'>Re contribution of reed to intonation:

Recently, I&#39;ve been playing a cut-down "Bari" baritone reed on tenor. I
noticed that compared to tenor reeds, I&#39;ve had to push in a bit further. The
reed still is a bit wider than tenor reeds, and the profile is also a bit
different.

The mouthpiece has some added baffle material, enough that I&#39;ve had to pull
it out more to stay in tune (to the point of adding an extension to the
mpc). The baritone reed compensates somewhat for that.

I haven&#39;t had any intonation problems.  If anything, this setup feels
better. There is some problem with switching back and forth between this
reed and other tenor reeds though, as I need to re-adjust.

What I don&#39;t know yet, is whether I&#39;ll be able to get any other baritone
reeds to play so well. So far, my first attempt has failed.

            <pre class='message__body'>I followed John&#39;s method, to calculate the resonant frequency (F=c/2*l) of my Martin neck tube (with tenon removed), and then compared it to the actual played frequency of the neck section, by blowing across the end with both ends open (as per flute).  The regime formed with both ends open is very weak, but still clearly audible.  The pitch was the same blown from either end, with the register key closed.

Calculated Frequency:1018Hz
Actual Played Frequency:  932Hz
Difference: 153 cents

So you can see, that including the entire neck in the frs calculation, at least in this case, would have resulted in a considerable amount of error, so there would be no telling if your mouthpiece/constriction was actually close to having the correct frequency or not.

You might want to rethink that with the pitch of the tube the length of
the highest palm key notes without the octave key.  Take the 2nd mode
frequency of that and see what you get.   [B-)]

By the way Benade taught that class at Case Western University in
Cleveland, OH.  It says so on page 1 of the class notes you quoted.  He
taught there his entire career from 1952 till the time of his death in
1987---35 years later.

(1318.56Hz).  That would put the displacement anti-node of that
resonance, which he calls frs, just inside the neck opening.  The actual
mouthpiece+ entire neck resonance for a tenor, as John advocates, is a
concert E (659.28Hz), an octave lower.  Do you see the contradiction?

Scavone, I believe, has some stuff about that. That may
account for some of the disrepancy. F=c/2*l certainly
doesn&#39;t work in this case; not unless it is closed/open
and complete.

This link gives some information about that.  Acoustic resonance
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_resonance>

I am not sure why Lance&#39;s played frequency is so far off the calculated
resonance of the tube.  I am trying to replicate his results by
recording the sound and then doing a frequency analysis.  So far I have
found the frequencies embodied in that airy tone to be all over the
spectrum and far too variable and unstable to get an accurate reading.  
Of course I will keep trying different methods.

John,  

I suggest you use your ears to narrow in on the frequency.  Blow gently across the small end and alternate having the large end open, and then 1/4 closed.  The pitch will drop ca. 1/2 step in the semi-closed position.  You can also hear the frequency by holding the small end 1" from your ear, and then tapping the outside of the tenon with your finger (not the nail).  If you can&#39;t hear it, then I suggest a different profession.:-)

The sound analysis program I am using does that with good accuracy, given a stable recorded sound wave.  Unfortunately recording the airy sound blown across the end or the tapping sound does not provide that.  When I take a small sampling at different parts of those recoded wave sounds, I get wildly different frequencies.

If you can record your sounds to an MP3 file and send it to me, I can see if your efforts produce any better results.  My ears work just fine hearing and matching pitches, they just don&#39;t tell me the exact Hz of the frequency I am listening to---especially if it is an unstable airy whistle or the "thonk" of tapping a metal tube.

So, close to that of an open/open cylinder. I was wrong. I
still don&#39;t know what you are trying to do, but it is
obvious that neither of you is an end-blown flute player.
Blowing across the open neck I can get a strong and steady
tone with a very solid pitch center.

            <pre class='message__body'>With my Yamaha alto neck, I get a 20 cents sharp G.  So that would be 804 Hz, close to Toby&#39;s 820 Hz.  These notes are easy to lip down but not up.  I&#39;m probably playing flat since most of my embouchure was developed via regular flutes and beer bottles (one end closed).

Blow the large end of the neck like a Turkish ney. My alto
neck sound 820 Hz, +-10 Hz. With mpc it blows 450. With
mpc much less air is required to get a sounding note, but
both are solid and clear.

across the large end (at least for alto). One tip is that
you have to have a very wide embouchure and blow pretty
hard (and needless to say it has to be aimed exactly
right).

body for frequencies just below Frs.  [paraphrased to fit the
saxophone].

This along with the fact that the neck and mouthpiece of the alto sax
produces close to a written F2 (Ab concert) would indicate that the Frs
is approximately the first mode frequency of the shortest tube note and
not the second as Benade states in his typed class notes.

By the way, using the "airy sound" created by blowing across the small
end and a tuner I found the pitch of my alto neck used in the study to
be Ab concert + 40 cents which comes out to a frequency of  about 851
hz.

The calculated frequency using the measured length of the neck  is  f = 
346/ 2*197  =   878 hz

Since the formula uses 2 x l,  that indicates that the wave turns around
and goes back  which suggests an end correction at the large end.   The
formula for the end correction commonly used is  .6 times the radius.

The radius of the large end (23 d) is 11.5 mm.    11.5 x .6 =  6.9 mm  
Putting that into the formula we get:

f = 346 / 2* (197 + 6.9)  =   848.5 hz   which is in good agreement with
the played frequency of 851 hz.

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

Should we be concerned that Benade, did not include the factor for end correction in his frs formula in the first place?  

Since you are playing an open cone, there would be need of 2 end corrections, as the wave reflects at both ends.  Small radius 6.3mm *.6 = 3.78mm additional length, so, f = 346 / 2* (197 + 6.9 + 3.78)  = 833Hz.  The interval 833hz to 851Hz is 34 cents, almost a quarter tone.  For the combined mouthpiece + neck frequency to be correct then, the mouthpiece would need to be 34 cents sharp.  How much will that 34 cent error affect the integral relationships of the higher resonances?

      You are right of course.  In FMA p. 470 Benade writes that there will be

a pressure node of the Frs (on a sax) inside the neck for frequencies

just above Frs and below the junction of where the neck goes inside the

body for frequencies just below Frs.  [paraphrased to fit the

saxophone].



This along with the fact that the neck and mouthpiece of the alto sax

produces close to a written F2 (Ab concert) would indicate that the Frs

is approximately the first mode frequency of the shortest tube note and

not the second as Benade states in his typed class notes.



By the way, using the "airy sound" created by blowing across the small

end and a tuner I found the pitch of my alto neck used in the study to

be Ab concert + 40 cents which comes out to a frequency of  about 851

hz.



The calculated frequency using the measured length of the neck  is  f = 

346/ 2*197  =   878 hz



Since the formula uses 2 x l,  that indicates that the wave turns around

and goes back  which suggests an end correction at the large end.   The

formula for the end correction commonly used is  .6 times the radius.



The radius of the large end (23 d) is 11.5 mm.    11.5 x .6 =  6.9 mm  

Putting that into the formula we get:



f = 346 / 2* (197 + 6.9)  =   848.5 hz   which is in good agreement with

the played frequency of 851 hz.

I would beg to differ. On page 470, in FMA, as Toby has explained, Benade describes the the location of the pressure node for played tones of frequencies equal to the mouthpiece + entire neck resonance, and those nodes for played notes higher and lower than that.  In the class notes, he describes the actual independent resonance of the cavity + constriction, almost one octave higher.  

The alto&#39;s mouthpiece + neck frequency is then concert Ab (830.61Hz).  The shortest tube without octave key produces ca. a concert G (783.99Hz) and it&#39;s second mode, one octave higher is 1567.98Hz.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yep. The point is that you never have a tube length as
short as the mpc+neck alone. The exercise is to play the
octave lower and then "cut the wave in half" so to speak,
by playing the second mode via the register key. That
forms a pressure node at the halfway point, and that
should be at exactly the same point as the pressure node
at the end of the neck when the neck is blown apart from
the body.

If the pressure node in the second register using the body
is indeed at the end of the neck when the horn is played,
it shows that the tube resonances (at least the second
peak) is in the right place, and the cone profile is
correct.

            <pre class='message__body'>Think about it.  Blowing across the end of a saxophone neck is the
acoustic equivalent of blowing across the head joint of a flute.  The
end at which the soundwave is generated by the air stream being split
into two part I believe does not have an "end correction" since the air
is being pushed into the tube at that point.  Maybe our resident flute
expert Toby can say for sure if the flute has an "end correction" at
both ends.  My sense of logic says that it does not.

When the mouthpiece and neck are on the saxophone under normal playing
conditions there, of course, will not be an end correction at the end of
the neck since there is no opening there.  So no, it think Benade knew
exactly what he was writing about "in the first place".  Also no one
seems to be quite sure exactly what the end correction is for a conical
tube, so most use the one for a cylindrical tube which is calculated to
be .6 times the radius, according to Joe Wolfe.

Yep. The point is that you never have a tube length as
short as the mpc+neck alone. The exercise is to play the
octave lower and then "cut the wave in half" so to speak,
by playing the second mode via the register key. That
forms a pressure node at the halfway point, and that
should be at exactly the same point as the pressure node
at the end of the neck when the neck is blown apart from
the body.

If the pressure node in the second register using the body
is indeed at the end of the neck when the horn is played,
it shows that the tube resonances (at least the second
peak) is in the right place, and the cone profile is
correct.

            <pre class='message__body'>"Think about it.  Blowing across the end of a saxophone neck is the 
acoustic equivalent of blowing across the head joint of a flute.  The 
end at which the soundwave is generated by the air stream being split 
into two part I believe does not have an "end correction" since the air 
is being pushed into the tube at that point.  Maybe our resident flute 
expert Toby can say for sure if the flute has an "end correction" at 
both ends.  My sense of logic says that it does not."

John,

I get the exact same pitch by tapping my neck on the outside of the 
tube, equidistant from both ends, as I do by blowing across it.

            <pre class='message__body'>"When the mouthpiece and neck are on the saxophone under normal playing 
conditions there, of course, will not be an end correction at the
 end of the neck since there is no opening there.  So no, it think 
Benade knew exactly what he was writing about "in the first place".


There is a huge fault in your logic.  You made your logical deduction after examining only one of the necessary two conditions for frs testing.  

First, our universal truth.  Because you claim an end correction is necessary for testing the played frequency of the neck tube alone, then we must assume that an end correction is necessary in all cases of play testing any tube.  This is our universal truth.

The first part of your equation is true, the calculated frequency of the section under normal playing conditions does not require an end correction.  

The second part, which you omitted (a common propaganda "trick"), actually playing the mouthpiece on the neck, as per your universal truth, requires that we make an end correction in order to get an accurate frequency. 

As Benade never mentioned this fact, either Benade is wrong in not applying our universal truth, or you are wrong in proposing it.

            <pre class='message__body'>I can easily get a loud, steady tone, by covering 1/2 of the end with my lower lip, but since there is a displacement anti-node there, the pitch is lowered almost a semi-tone.  Both ends must be open, with nothing closer than 1" to the opening, or the pitch will be affected.  Tapping gives a definite tone, short, and soft, but easily matched with a tunable oscillator, using headphones.  Like tuning tablas.

            <pre class='message__body'>Of course it has an end correction; there is a
displacement antinode there, right? No different on that
score from the other end. There is an additional and very
important end correction at the blowing end, however,
having to do with changing the impedance by shading the
hole with the player&#39;s lip. This can vary notes by way
more than a semitone, so it is VERY important to make sure
that your lip does not protrude at all over the edge of
the tenon end when you blow the note.

            <pre class='message__body'>None really. It is simply a visualization of whether the
tube and neck are correctly proportioned to overblow the
octave in tune. And it is almost impossible to test, since
there is no good way to find the exact position of the
displacement antinode while you are playing the note. In a
soprano with a straight tube and detachable neck, you
could put a bead on the end of a long, thin rod and push
it up from the bottom to find the point and see if it is
at the bottom of the neck tenon, but ONLY if a fingered
note played the exact same frequency as the mpc and neck
alone. It is basically a practically useless piece of
information.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Toby for that clarification.  On our saxophone neck "flute" blown to create a pitch, will the blown end use the same formula for its "end correction" as the open end?  I have done more research and found out about an "embouchure hole" correction on flutes, but I am not sure this applies directly to what we are trying to measure with this "device".

            <pre class='message__body'>We make NO apology for making a profit on the products we manufacture. This
is how we make a living. I rather doubt that any members of this group who
are not self employed labor for free, so they are most certainly profiting
from their labor.

 

We know that to succeed in this business we have to offer high quality
innovative products. This is particularly true for a small company such as
ours, which has no aspirations toward significant growth beyond our present
size. We have been quite successful (much to the consternation of some
members of this group!) because we have offered and sold products that are
desired by the saxophone community at a price they are willing to pay. It&#39;s
really a pretty democratic process: if the saxophone community likes what we
are doing and are willing to pay the prices we ask, they essentially get to
vote about whether or not we stay in business every day.

 

We are very proud of our products and the reception they have received. We
don&#39;t just sit around and talk about saxophones and saxophone products, we
actually make them and offer them to the world for public evaluation. If
there is any doubt in your mind, let me assure you that our goal is to
maximize the profit we make on everything we sell (so we don&#39;t have to get
day jobs) and to put any excess over and above our costs in our pockets. Any
questions?

The use of the word "profitable" in the second sentence says it all.

world centers around selling things for profit doesn&#39;t mean that is true
for the rest of us.  Nor does it make you any better than or less than
anyone else on this forum who make a comfortable living doing other
things.  The fact that you fail to see a "profit application" in these
theoretical discussions does not in any way diminish the value of the
information the rest of us are learning by participating.  If you really
feel what we are discussing is a waste of time, then I would advise you
to not waste your time by reading and and continually making negative
comments about the discussion.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have said MANY times I think the discussion should continue...I have also
tried to make clear my belief that the ideas put forth have very, very
little practical application in the real world of saxophone/mouthpiece
design and manufacture, and that the processes described by the posters are
not, AFAIK, employed by ANY manufacturers of saxophone products because they
do not yield any useable results. I think that manufacturers who are trying
to advance the technology do so by actually building products and evaluating
them rather than just talking about them. I would strongly urge you guys to
put your ideas into production and let the world see whether or not you know
what you are talking about. If you lack the resources or the inclination to
actually produce products which are representative of your ideas yourself,
sell them to existing manufacturers. I&#39;ve made a lot of money over the years
doing design consulting for numerous companies. They are always looking for
good, valid ideas. It looks from here like your only purpose is to "self
appoint" yourself as an expert without putting yourself to the only valid
test: build something and see how it plays!

Good for you Steve.  The best of luck with that.  The fact that your world
centers around selling things for profit doesn&#39;t mean that is true for the
rest of us.  Nor does it make you any better than or less than anyone else
on this forum who make a comfortable living doing other things.  The fact
that you fail to see a "profit application" in these theoretical discussions
does not in any way diminish the value of the information the rest of us are
learning by participating.  If you really feel what we are discussing is a
waste of time, then I would advise you to not waste your time by reading and
and continually making negative comments about the discussion.

So ,if you were able to work on 
your theory, Toby, 
you could take a certain model horn  and work out the 
following. With say a Selmer Mk6 and a good 
embouchure,not 
pinched,blown up or down, you should have the volume(capacity) of the of
 
a mouthpiece (with reed closed) between a certain range. This should 
give correct tuning for most Selmer Mk6&#39;s.  Keeping the volume the same 
but 
changing the internal shape would make the piece sound different and 
play 
different but keep it in tune without moving it on the cork.
I don&#39;t think that volume(capacity) 
would be too 
hard to measure on a mouthpiece. 


Would this be too hard for you theory 
guys to work 
out?  Is someone willing to try this on some 
working 
models?  Better still , has someone done this? 
If so,what 
were the results?"

This is exactly what we are trying to figure out, in a scientific way.  The experiments will come when the theory is clear.  We have difficulties in discussing it since there are different views on what certain things mean, and how some theoretical ideas should be applied.

John chided me for my use of the term self-aggrandizement, and I agree it was probably a little over the top; I apologize to you all.

However, my main point still stands.  You guys can&#39;t even agree on the meaning of the most basic term in this whole missing cone concept (Frs).  That seems to me a sine qua non to developing a theory that can be tested.  Instead of arguing about it, why not do a few tests and see what happens?  

I&#39;m not a professional scientist, but I know some.  And you have to do preliminary experiments in the development of any theory.  So far as I can tell, John is the only one doing that, but he is also the one shouting the loudest in this discussion.  (For example, John, why go to the trouble of analyzing the posts over the last three months just to zing Mr. Goodson?  Pointless and noisy...)

I would really like it if you guys would just try to be more professional and civilized in your exchanges.  I have been reading these threads for a long long time, and will continue to do so (because I am VERY interested in acoustics and mouthpieces!), but it&#39;s difficult to find the wheat of information in the chaff of diatribe.

Now I will really shut up :)

I&#39;d like to see you quiet guys get more involved.  We all learned the scientific method in Jr High, and we all have computers.  Here are two guys (John and I) proposing to accomplish the same thing (mouthpiece volume matching and frs matching) using two different methods.  Everything needs to be examined.  You don&#39;t have to understand everything about acoustics in order to recognize calculation errors, unaccounted for real world elements, false logical formulas, erroneous deductive reasoning, contradictions, etc.   You should be all over us and every word we post.  Then it wouldn&#39;t seem like we were at each others throat so much, perhaps.

"Hey, wait a minute Lance, 2 + 2 = 4, not 5."  Hey John, if you say a = b, and c = d, you can&#39;t conclude that a = c.

For starters to show his hypocrisy when 76% of his own posts are not on
topic by his own definition when he is continuously deriding the three
of us for not adhering to the so called "topic" of this forum.

Pointless and noisy... he (John)  is also the one shouting the loudest

Now I will really shut up :)

That seems to me a sine qua non to developing a theory that can be
tested.  Instead of arguing about it, why not do a few tests and see
what happens?

            <pre class='message__body'>Regarding Tolerances:

Toby,  

You mentioned that you felt it was senseless to haggle over a mm here or a 25 cents there.  What then do you consider the critical limits of good frs and volume adjustments to be?  

We want both (and actually all) conditions to be as perfect as they can be while using the normal embouchure.  Remember that both requirements are being affected by embouchure adjustments simultaneously.  If the volume is spot on, but the frs is flat by 25 cents, they will never get better matched than that, no matter how the player adjusts his embouchure.

Further, the amount of amplitude that a resonance can contribute to a regime is dependent upon it&#39;s degree of integral alignment, and it can only contribute if it lies within 1/2 of it&#39;s frequency amplitude bandwidth from "in tune".  The more "out of tune" it is, within it&#39;s freq. amp. bandwidth, the more it will cause formation of the regime to shift it&#39;s pitch center.  The more the pitch shifts, the more the player adjusts his embouchure.  The more he adjusts his embouchure......

It&#39;s not for nothing that Benade warned against neglecting to fix little acoustical problems whenever possible.  The player will subconsciously adjust to compensate, which causes other problems, and so on, until, the player develops bad habits and becomes frustrated.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree that things should be as good as they can be, no
question. The problem as I see it (and I could be wrong)
is that there are big factors, such as the impedance of
the reed  (controlled by the embouchure) which affect
these parameters that we are trying to measure so
meticulously. It&#39;s like trying to sterilize an operating
theatre with a window open. You will notice that Benade
does not say to try to calculate the internal volume or
Frs to the nth degree. He says to see how the instrument
is working and whether it "sings", and knowing what
happens when you change the internal volume or the Frs, to
start adjusting empirically.

I lost the thread at some point when you guys were
discussing measuring the resonance of the neck. I had a
good look at my alto neck and I noticed two or three
things: not only is the tenon cylindrical, the small end
is also cylindrical, for a good two centimeters. Also, at
the top of the tenon, at the curve, it is nothing like a
straight cone. So where does that leave the discussion of
the cone angle extrapolated to find the volume of the
missing cone? It could go a couple of millileters either
way, it seems, depending on where you measure what.

Then, of course, there is the famous question of the
different cone angles across the body, and the torturous
argument about which should be used to find the missing
cone volume.

In my book the answer is clear: all of them, but not even
that: the various cones are nowhere near ideal, because
the bore is full of tone holes, and makers have also
slightly changed cone angles locally here and there. None
of us even knows how to measure the effective cone angle
with all these variables, and we are arguing about
fractions of a millileter based on the missing cone
volume? This seems absurd to me.

If you look closely at Nederveen or Scavone, they are
happy when the measured results are in rough agreement
with theory. I think it is total fantasy land to think
that one can actually do more than get in the ball park
with our methods and knowledge. We are definitely in the
ball park; now is the time to see if what we think we know
is in any way in rough agreement with reality. 

Just my opinion.
