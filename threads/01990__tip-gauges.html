Thanks Keith,
I also found out that Babbitt sells tip gauges as well as glass gauges. One 
for sax mouthpieces and one for clarinet so I think I&#39;m just going to order 
all the stuff from them which will save me $100 over the price of the Morgan 
or Winslow kits.

            <pre class='message__body'>The tip opening gauge that Babbit sells is pretty basic: it&#39;s not super
precise, and only goes to .120. It is cheap and easy to use, probably just
fine for most hobbyists.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Babbitt tip gauge and a number of depth gauges...the Babbitt 
gauge (at least the one that I have) is surprisingly accurate, but 
requires more thought to get a good reproducible measurement. You 
need to make certain that you are reading it at the right place. 
Generally (for a typical tip cut) the gage contacts the tip rail at 
the &#39;inside&#39; (i.e. towards the chamber) edge of the tip rail. You 
therefore have to read the gage at this point, NOT at the tip...many 
folks make this mistake. The depth gage always picks the highest 
point of the tip rail. I have found pretty good agreement between my 
depth gauges and the wand when I am careful...has a consistent offset 
of ~0.0015. The wand is much faster to use.

            <pre class='message__body'>Jeff, how much error would there be in a tip reading on a wand if it was
read at the very tip instead of inside the tip rail?  Tip rail thickness
varies from ~.020" to .060" or more.

            <pre class='message__body'>It depends on the taper of the wand. My Babbitt wand tapers 
about .001 for each .023 of length. So for an .023 tip rail, the 
error is .001, for an .069, it is .003. Probably not to worry about, 
but enough to require awareness and consistency.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree.  Not huge, but worth considering.

Not enough to explain why many mouthpieces are .005-.010 smaller than "the
charts" list or as they are marked, like Bergs.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a theory that has held up to date on these. The tip rail is 
always angled with respect to the table. Most of us (I think) call 
the tip opening the distance from the plane of table to the closest 
point on the tip rail...this is because that is what we measure with 
a wand or a depth gauge. If you measure with a caliper right at the 
tip, however, you always get a larger number. I added a diagram to 
the &lt;Gauging> photo directory to indicate what I am blathering 
about...

            <pre class='message__body'>I thought about this a lot.  I think Paul may measure to the tip.

Some Vandoren specs I analyzed seemed to make more sense if you assume the
tip was measured at the very tip AND the facing length was where the curve
meets the table (a theoretical .0000" feeler).  I&#39;m sure there are a few
manufacturers and refacers that do things differently.

  I&#39;m thinking of making up some tip gauges using a 2 1/4" dial indicator. Would there be any interest if I can keep the price around $25.00 each?

            <pre class='message__body'>The tip gauge will be a 2 1/4" round dial gauge on 1/4" thick by 1" wide

Nothing fancy. Harbor Freight has the gauges frequently at $7.00 each! (1/2
price) as they do now.
 
I&#39;ll buy the parts and start the machining as soon as some of your money
begins to show up in my PayPal account (steve@...). Let&#39;s figure
$4.00 flat shipping rate and see if I can do it that way. So everybody send
me money! ($29.00) Please allow 4 to 6 weeks as Harbor Freight frequently
can take 3 weeks to deliver.
 
Thanks.

  With a jp email server, I may have to charge a little more than $4.00 shipping!  :-)

  Whatever it costs me... okay?

    I&#39;m thinking of making up some tip gauges using a 2 1/4" dial indicator. Would there be any interest if I can keep the price around $25.00 each?

            <pre class='message__body'>How long is long enough for you? The one planned will be 4" overall which
will leave about 3 1/2" from the stop to the end of the plate. I would think
that to be fine. However, I can make one extra long if you would like.

You may unsubscribe or change settings (for example, to view posts only on the web) at any time by clicking the blue "Edit Membership" near the top of the group web page.  Then, in the lower right corner click the button "Leave the group".

            <pre class='message__body'>Many members do not know how to get removed from the group mailing list.  Some old listserve forums used to allow members to unsubscribe by sending an Email with the subject as "unsubscribe" to get them dropped.  Yahoo Groups do not work this way.  Yahoo Groups do allow members to to change their membership status and how the messages are sent or not sent.  

When I see messages like this I just assume the member wants to be deleted and does not know how to do it themselves.  So I delete them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the explanation. I myself have learned so much by just following the threads in this group. This and Saxophone Repair have provided a wealth of information for folks like myself. I know this has been a real education and I appreciate all the folks who choose to participate.
