            <pre class='message__body'>Hi
   I am having some difficulty getting to the files section to check out 
the tools list .
Amazon is having a sale on tools and I could use a digital caliper . 
The price varies from around $20 to $300 !!!
Does anybody have a recommendation ?

What kind of problems?  Most problems are out of my hands, but I would like
to hear some detail.  This site has been virtually problem-free.

As for calipers, I find an inexpensive set of digital calipers to be
usefull.  MicroMark.com has a few I think.

Thanks for the heads up on sites . I&#39;ll check and compare prices to the Amazon sale .

I have had difficulty with Yahoo due to different passwords , user names , email address&#39;s 
user profiles ... It&#39;s all to complicated and I don&#39;t have the time to fiddle around with such 
nonsense .  
   Anyway , I think I fixed it .
