            <pre class='message__body'>OK, so I was inspired by some pics of a dial type tip opening measuring gauge that Steve 
Fowler had come up with and decided to try to make one of my own.   I went to Harbor 
Freight and picked up a dial gauge for $6.99 (now I noticed they are $13.99 on their website) 
and a stainless steel square for $7.99 (now you can get a set for the same price).  Anyway, I 
prefer the styling and craftsmanship of Steve&#39;s version but I would like to get some feedback 
on my version which, although it looks pretty half-assed in comparison, it does seem to 
pretty accurate.  Here is a link to my webpage for some pics and if the feedback isn&#39;t too 
terrible, I&#39;d like to post these pics to the mouthpiece work photos section.

Let me know what you think, and honest criticism is not only welcomed but appreciated.  
Thanks in advance, Craig
