            <pre class='message__body'>Chamber SHAPE

Baffle shape is the most important part of the complete chamber shape.

But also of interest:
         1. General air flow considerations:
                 A. Side wall shaping, straight or curved.
                 B. Ramp shaping. 
          2. Horn specific considerations (assuming horn is known):
                 A. Smooth transition to the neck.
                 B. Tuning (missing conic truncation volume).
