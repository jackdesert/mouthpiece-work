            <pre class='message__body'>I just worked on a old Goldbeck alto piece made out of Nickle Silver 
(which actually has no Silver in it).  This stikes me as a good metal 
mouthpiece material.  Its about as soft as brass, but it does not 
need to be plated.  Any idea why its not used anymore?
