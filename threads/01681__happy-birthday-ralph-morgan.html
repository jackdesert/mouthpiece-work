            <pre class='message__body'>Happy Birthday indeed.  It is great to see someone at any age enjoying what
he does and even more so here, knowing that it&#39;s Ralph&#39;s 80th.  I can only
hope that I&#39;m still loving what I do when I&#39;m 80.  Terrific!

All the best,

Ralph H.

best!]
