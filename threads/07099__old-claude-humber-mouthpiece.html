            <pre class='message__body'>It was a long time ago...I sent away to Claude Humber after reading about longer facings..perhaps it was the Baines History of Woodwinds.  ..He sent me one of his clarinet mouthpieces...38, 21, 12, 6  tip is 1.13mm.   It isn&#39;t a long as I requested from him but it does play well...all his mouthpieces are plastic... Back then I probably paid 6 dollars for it.  I must admit he was able to produce a wide variety of mouthpieces.  Lush sounding alto mouthpieces in a "Hollywood" facing to edgier mouthpieces, classical and even a Benny Goodman facing.  I only wish that distance prevented me from meeting him in person...he treated you like you were Benny Goodman. I wonder if his books and list of facings are still out there somewhere.

John  The mouthpiece you have just described sounds just right, with its LONG lay, gentle curve and close tip. The De Franco with its LONG lay and .067 tip is a monster. I used this combination for a time until I learned the art of refacing. Though it seemed to play smoothly and with great expression, articulation was poor and it did not sound as good in tone, on recordings, I feel. The open tip was not the problem, but the LONG lay coupled with the open tip, was. When I say LONG, I mean 19mm. I use 18/17/16MM lengths. One example is .055 tip .630(16mm)length.  32-23-14-8.5
Unlike sax mouthpieces which sometimes increase in length with increasing tip openings, I don&#39;t think this is a good idea on clarinet and I have found the opposite to be the case.
I suggest you take down the table on the De Franco, to shorten the lay and close the tip.
