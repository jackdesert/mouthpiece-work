            <pre class='message__body'>Hi All:



    I am playing a gig on new years to fill in a trumpet chair. I am 
going to do this job on both soprano and tenor and while I am weel 
covered equipment wise on tenor, I am taking this opportunity to 
upgrade some of my soprano equipment. Thus far I am looking at 3 
different brands of mouhpieces, Otto Link metal, Dukoff D chamber, or 
Ponzol M1. I am curious to know out of these 3 how these rank in 
brightness and power. Now I am very well aware that each player is a 
little different and has different personal tastes, but I figure that 
this would be an ideal place to get a general idea about these 3 
mouthpieces.

Thanks,
Chad

I have not played the Ponzol M1, but it may be a tad darker than the Link and Dukoff.  The Ponzol would probably play better out-of-the-box.  
 
You might want to check out the Runyon line.  They are all bright and play in tune for most players.
 
You will find more responses from posting your question on the Sax On The Web forum.  There are many more members there who may have tried all three mouthpieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>you might want to take a look at my solid brass soprano mouthpiece. It&#39;s a
medium small chamber
with a compound baffle with rollover. We&#39;ve got &#39;em on eBay and at
www.nationofmusic.com. I think it will give you the brightness you need with
excellent intonation and no blowing resistance.
