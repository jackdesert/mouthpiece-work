Well the measuring has commenced, and last years free hand effort 
can easily be graded.

It is a Jumbo Java tenor 55

 The .0015 point is 47.0 mm from the tip
     .010          24.0
     .024          13.7
     .034          11.7
     .050          08.4

  Tip is .084

I&#39;m a retired enthusiastic amateur, who was attempting to be better 
heard in a guitar band.

The measurements that I&#39;ve found in the first 450 posts, seem to 
suggest that I&#39;ve got the lay a little too far aft....:)

Any suggestions regarding a more playable contour, would be 
appreciated.....

Ross

Ouch!  Just looking at it hurts.  My "***" notes below are for a 
radial arc between the 47 facing length and the .084" tip opening.  
This will be a lot more responsive as you approch my suggested 
numbers.  You will probably need a much harder reed if you have 
actually been playing on this piece.  Or, you may need to open it up 
to .090"+.

The piece is not playable as is, and I&#39;d like to use it in a rock setting if possible....
The lay lengths  I&#39;ve been seeing in the first 500 postings, seem to be in the twenty mm range.
If I&#39;m able to lap the table down 10 thow, do you see any reason a shorter lay couldn&#39;t be used?
Assuming I can keep the table flat....

If I were to lap till 0015 was at the 24mm mark, would that be a more reasonable starting point...?

Thanks again for starting such a fabulous sight.......
I&#39;m blown away by the level of information.

For your amusement, I&#39;ve attached a picture of the home made facing device, that led to the above measurements.

So you do have more work cut out for you.  You need to cut down the table
to shorten the facing length.  This may be very difficult to do and keep it
flat.  Plus for a rock gig, you may want a larger tip opening and a more
open tip than a .084".  It depends on you chops.  If you can handle it
without getting tired during the gig, you should go larger.  Is this a
Jumbo Java?

You facing jig is pretty clever.  But the radius looks too long to me.  It
should be more on the order of 5"-6" or so.

If you would send the arc for a larger opening, I&#39;ll try that.

Hi Keith

Well the lapping was successful, and I&#39;ve been slowly approaching 
your .084 radius numbers.
After lowering the baffle inside the tip last night, it&#39;s the best 
it&#39;s ever played....

I&#39;ve dropped it about .015......
Is there much to be gained by going deeper...?

And what were the actual arc lengths, for the .084 and .100 rads. 
that you gave me.

Thanks again.
Ross

The R for the .100 curve is 4.93".

The R for the .084 curve is 6.00".

Both have the same facing length of 47 = 23.5mm with the .0015"

Hi Keith
Over the past couple of weeks,I&#39;ve been sneaking up on your 
measurements (below), and playing between each filing session.

Filing started near the tip where the largest differences were, and
the first couple of trials, there were large improvements over the 
whole range of the horn.

However I&#39;m still short of the 10, 24, and 34 measurements, and the 
piece is becoming too "heavy" for me.

Seeing as how removing material near the table adds weight the 
quickest, I wonder about starting again, and use a shorter radius..?
Is that logical...?

I have tried the files section to see if anything was listed around
5 inches....but for some reason this computer locks up on most of the 
downloads.....?
(You had said that the measurements below were for a 6 inch rad.)

Thanks again.

Ross

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith


As .024 and .010 were moved farther back from the tip, the reed (2.25 Legere) began feeling
"heavy" and  muddy, requiring more bite, with no payback in tone or volume....
Making the lowest few notes much harder to control, and removing tone overall....?

( Moving .050 and .034 back, added a little more weight to the bite, but paid back with both tone and volume. )

However, my "sneaking up" was flawed.
I&#39;ve just finished re measuring again, and have found that my .050 measurement of 6.5, is now reading 7.2 and is well beyond your recommended curve.
I can only imagine that I had dirt in my .050 stack of shims while filing....:(

But at any rate, it was playing better, before working further back, which makes me think that a shorter radius may be better suited than
a smaller tip opening with a long lay.....(I&#39;m using it in a guitar band)
It would require a return to the lapping table either way, but that was fairly easy last time.....

Does a 5 inch radius, with a .086 tip sound like a reasonable choice...?

At any rate here are the numbers in mms.(Jumbo Java Tenor)

            Suggested            Actual

0015        23.5                    23.5
010          18                       17.6
024           13                       12.4
034            10.25                   10.0
050            7.2                       6.75
Tip             086

Thanks in advance
Ross

            <pre class='message__body'>Ross,

Based on where you are at now, I would go after these new targets:

.0015 23.1  
.010  17.7
.024  12.8
.034  10.2
.050   6.7

FYI, these are for a 6.16" radius, but I do not find conversing in terms of
facing radius as useful.  Its just not part of the players&#39; language.

For ref, you said you are now at:
23.5
17.6
12.4
10
6.75

So I would fix the .024 number only and try it.  Perhaps lean a little
towards the .034" area as you fix the .024" area.  This should make the MP
"lighter" and more responsive for the mid range and lower notes.  As it is
now, there is a hump there in the facing curve you are asking the reed to
bend around.  This requires more air pressure/flow to get the reed to
speak.  When it finally speaks, you get a note that is louder and heavier
than you may want.

If the table is flat, leave the .0015" reading alone.

  Ross,

  Based on where you are at now, I would go after these new targets:

  .0015 23.1  
  .010  17.7
  .024  12.8
  .034  10.2
  .050   6.7

  FYI, these are for a 6.16" radius, but I do not find conversing in terms of
  facing radius as useful.  Its just not part of the players&#39; language.

  For ref, you said you are now at:
  23.5
  17.6
  12.4
  10
  6.75

  So I would fix the .024 number only and try it.  Perhaps lean a little
  towards the .034" area as you fix the .024" area.  This should make the MP
  "lighter" and more responsive for the mid range and lower notes.  As it is
  now, there is a hump there in the facing curve you are asking the reed to
  bend around.  This requires more air pressure/flow to get the reed to
  speak.  When it finally speaks, you get a note that is louder and heavier
  than you may want.

  If the table is flat, leave the .0015" reading alone.

I would lap the table some and shoot for:

23.0
17.7
12.9
10.4
7.0
tip .090

Avoid cutting the .0015" and .050" feeler areas any more.  Open the 
tip only and bring down the hump in the facing curve at the .024-
.034" range.
