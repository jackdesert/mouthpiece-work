some mpces where the baffle is fairly prominent and then it drops with 
a steeper angle into the chamber and some more gradual. I want as big 
and fat a sound coming out of my horn but controllable. 

Keith if you are reading this, you mentioned in my other query about 
the tip opening process, that you lengthen the facing curve with the 
opening of the tip, how do you judge how much to lengthen using my 
example?

If you were to cut the mouthpiece in half and viewed this profile of a 
well playing mpce, from tip over a baffle, how much "headroom" would 
there be above the top of the baffle to the facing for a free blowing 
mpce with little resistance?

It depends on where you are starting from.  If it is in the 44-48 range, I
would add 2 numbers to it.  If it was shorter, I might add 4, longer, keep
it where it is.

I would either roll-over the baffle near the tip rail or make a short
straight baffle.  When I gun site along the baffle from the tip, I like to
be able to see at least 1/2 of the bore opening.  Any higher and I feel it
chokes off the sound some.  Seeing the whole bore is a good target.

            <pre class='message__body'>I find it important to cut material away just behind the tip rail for free-blowingness. No matter how high the baffle is generally (and it is possibly more important if it is high), there needs to be a clear space just behind the tip rail--if you have this it improves response and makes the mpc
 much less likely to chirp with a minimal difference to the overall sound. At least this has been my experience.

It depends on where you are    starting from. If it is in the 44-48 range, I
would add 2 numbers to it. If    it was shorter, I might add 4, longer, keep
it where it is.
