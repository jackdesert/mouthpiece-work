            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Dukoff Model 45 that it beat up a little that I would like to 
have the table flattend, tip and rails worked, and facing curve 
cleaned up on. BUT, I have to be able to have the piece back by June 
2nd. I can send it out ASAP if someone calls me and tells me they can 
do it. Please call me (913)406-6829 let me know if it something you 
can handle. I live in Kansas so shipping isn&#39;t bad to anywhere. 

Thank you,
