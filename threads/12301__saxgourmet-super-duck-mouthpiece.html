> Here&#39;s one of our Super Duck tenor mouthpieces that I&#39;m getting ready for a client this morning......please note the long, high cliff baffle leading into a somewhat large chamber.......the "duck bill" style beak is quite pronounced......these are all machined from a solid brass billet and are individually hand faced by me here in New Orleans......this is my original design and is available nowhere else......this one has a .120 tip opening and a facing length of 52
