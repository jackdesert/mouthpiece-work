Has anyone observed any limitations to true radial facing curves?

            <pre class='message__body'>Some elliptical curves have slightly more resistance to help palm keys and
altissimo response.  They do this without resorting to short facing lengths
that give up low note response.  I think elliptical curves sound a little
edgier than radial curves too.  But I have not done anything resembling
formal studies on this.

For over a year I did nothing but radial facings and my clients were happy.
 Lately I lean my targets towards elliptical but they still are close to
radial.  I have seen good elliptical curves on Morgans and Ponzols, in case
you want to measure some to copy.

A well implemented radial curve will always beat out any other curve with a
few irregularities.
