I&#39;ve had stuff take a while before, so I&#39;m not too worried. I once 
ordered a gig bag from California over Christmas. Took 6 weeks.

Just to let you know that my guage arrived a few days ago no problem. I would also like to add my 2 cents to the UPS/USPS debate...I have had nothing but grief from UPS with outrageously high "customs clearance " (in some cases as much as doulbling the cost of the item!) charges as well as the fact that I never seem to be where they want to deliver (at work, at home) while on the other hand I have nothing but praise for the USPS...prompt, reliable service, most things just come straight through without the extra charges. 
Anyway, Merlin if your guage does not arrive soon you are welcome to borrow mine.
best regards,
James

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the feedback on the clearing fees on your end, though it would
be nice to have a $ figure for UPS clearing.

I once sent a box to Canada with 5 nice vintage HR mouthpieces I refaced
(Gregories, etc).  The value was over ~$1500.  It took 5 weeks to get there
by USPS.   I was sweating replacement costs.   UPS takes 2 days, but I do
not know what the clients pay in fees.  It was less trouble on my end.

Why would you be worried about replacements? It was insured for full 
value, wasn&#39;t it? There&#39;s no way I&#39;d ship something like that back to 
a client without it being insured. 

Most of the time here in Canada, I&#39;ll only ship back to a client via 
Expresspost. Very quick service (1-2 days in Canada, 3-5 to the US) 
and it includes $100 insurance; more can be purchased.

            <pre class='message__body'>In practice, I have heard it is very difficult to get UPS to pay on
insurance.  For damage, they need to inspect the original packaging.  For
loss, you probably need some documents that supports the value you are
claiming.  Not easy to get on vintage mouthpieces.
