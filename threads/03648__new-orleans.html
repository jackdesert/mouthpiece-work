	Sharon and I were forcibly evacuated by troops yesterday and are now 
with family in Birmingham, Alabama. 

	THANK GOD you&#39;re both OK!  You didn&#39;t get roughed up by them?  Guns pointed? 

	We were allowed to take NOTHING 
with us, so all we have is the clothes on our back. We had flooding on 
the first floor in the repair shop, the showroom, the shipping room, 
and the office. The warehouse we had next door seems to have floated 
off its foundation and was partially collapsed when we left. All 
survivivng inventory is still in New Orleans. We have nothing with us.

We don&#39;t expect to be able to reopen for at least six weeks. We don&#39;t 
know what the looters will leave, so we don&#39;t know what will be there 
when we get back. The Army is going from door to door opening houses 
and looking for bodies, so we expect to have everything left wide open. 
They were begining this process in our neighborhood as we were being 
loaded onto the truck that took us away. 

	They were taking guns at at gunpoint I saw on tv.  Bastards.


EVERY business we passed on the way out had been looted. 

I&#39;ll be dealing with insurance etc. for the next few days. I don&#39;t have 
regular internet or phone access, but wioll try to read this group when 
I can. 

	 

	Man, I am offshore now, but I do have net. 

	When I get home I&#39;ll call you, and see what I can send you.  Were you able to get
the hard drives from your computers? 

	Paul

Glad you all are safe.  So sorry to hear about the
loss you have suffered.  I know only time will tell to
what extent.  If you are ever in the Knoxville,
Tennessee area and need any help, please get in touch.

God bless you,

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a theory... I think the "authorities" in New Orleans WANT looting.  I saw
cops on the news prying burglar bars off a pawn shop to get in.  Not a home, a shop
in a business area.  The owner left it secured.  Those guys were either looting,
or they were going after 4473&#39;s (gun owners know what that is... see the movie Red
Dawn in case you don&#39;t know).   But my theory is they want to finish off the remainder. 
After the recent eminent domain ruling re New London, CT, I think they want to finish
off people there, condemn, eminent domain, or seize for nonpayment of taxes as much
property as possible.  Then bulldoze as much as possible, and people connected to
the "authorities" will be making a killing in New Orleans real estate.  Just my
theory... I think I need some more Reynolds Wrap (for my tin foil hat).  Paul Coats
