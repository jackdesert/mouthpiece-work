Sounds nice. A bit pricey at 5 "c-notes", but I understand that fine
artisans need to make a living. It would be nice to try one someday.

I checked out the Brendan Tibbs website. http://www.tibbs-vision.com/tibbs/

Interesting. Also, plenty of, shall we say, unsubstantiated claims; but
certainly no worse than anyone else! Personally, I should have preferred to
see an emphasis on the quality of the workmanship and less b.s.

Cast metals don&#39;t necessarily solidify into aligned crystals, unless some
extremely particular methods are employed to control the cooling. I know
that much. But in any case, wouldn&#39;t the vibrations of the mouthpiece itself
would be transmitted onto the cork, rather, and thence into the neck? So I
am skeptical that this makes a great difference in mouthpiece sound, but it
makes great ad copy.

Yes, as we know, a key part of every performance is dropping the mouthpiece
onto an anvil. The real reason metal mouthpieces are preferred is due to the
completely undistinguished "dink" of hard rubber as it strikes the anvil.
And of course, this has forced the glass mouthpiece into near extinction.

However, with the advent of inexpensive Chinese horns, perhaps performances
may now culminate with the dramatic dropping of the entire saxophone onto an
anvil.

There&#39;s nothing like an appeal to fear. I await seeing some solid evidence
of health problems incurred as a result of metal mouthpieces, plated or
otherwise. Perhaps we&#39;re all as mad as hatters (IIRC they suffered from
mercury poisoning), but we just don&#39;t realize it.
