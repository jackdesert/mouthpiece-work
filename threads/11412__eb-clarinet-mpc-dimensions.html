            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

I&#39;ve been a long time member of this forum, but very infrequent contributor.  I do enjoy all the information and conversation though.  Thanks for that!

I&#39;ve been making A and Bb barrels on my lathe with some very good success for several years here in Chicago.  Recently, I received a request by a very well known player to make a custom barrel for their Eb clarinet.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have an Eb mouthpiece to measure.  Would someone here be able help me by providing the the tenon length, inner/outer diameters of the bore and the diameter of the mpc at the base just before the tenon?  They have a Hawkins Mpc, which I believe is made on a zinner blank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
