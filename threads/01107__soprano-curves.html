            <pre class='message__body'>Does anybody have facing curves for soprano they could share? In 
particular, I want the "proper" curve for a Dukoff D8, if there is 
such a thing. In attempts to correct the defects in my D8, I think 
I&#39;ve made the facing too long and I&#39;m reluctant to do anything else 
until I know what a good curve looks like. If you have curves for 
something similar to a Dukoff, that would be great. I haven&#39;t had the 
opportunity to measure or even try other soprano pieces except a few 
that are more "middle of the road".

I have no less than 4 Dukoffs for alto that all have had some defect 
of some sort. One of them was pretty easy to fix and plays better for 
me than any alto mouthpiece I&#39;ve had. It then was easy to fix the 
others and get the optimum facing based on measurements from the good 
one.

Thanks,
Jon

            <pre class='message__body'>I could work out a recommended curve for you.  What set of feelers are you using?

Wow. That would be great, but I was hoping that you didn&#39;t have to go 
out of your way to measure something.

I recently misplaced my good set of feelers that my wife bought for 
me and so I only have the cheapie Craftsman 36-feeler set. If you 
don&#39;t think that these will work, let me know. I am using the 
standard 0.5mm unit glass gage.

Thanks in advance for your help!
Jon

            <pre class='message__body'>Your feeler set probably only goes to .035".  I have not found a source for
larger sizes.  I taped together some of the smaller sizes I was not usng to
get the larger sizes I needed.  I had to combine 2 cheapo feeler sets to
get my working guages.  This is not the best arrangement but it has been
good enough to get good facing results.  I keep putting off getting an
improved set due to my backlog.

I routinely check the thickness of my stacked feelers with my set of
digital calipers.  I also check my calipers against a precision guage
block.

The increments I use are in the archives somewhere.  I use a set of 10
feelers from .0015" to ~.095".  I could use a couple more larger sizes for
the big tenor and bari pieces.

For soprano sax, you only need to go up to .065" or so.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, if the Craftman feeler set is good enough for you, its 
certainly good enough for me!

Very gracious of you to work this up. I&#39;ve been trying to get a short 
facing like your 75/34 example but I wasn&#39;t using your old 
spreadsheet correctly. I kept having a major flat spot at by the tip. 
Your new spreadsheet sure cleared things up for me.

After about an hour of work using your chart I ended up with 
something more like 72/40, a bit more conservative. It plays like I 
remember my old Dukoff did many years ago: it requires some work to 
control it even with a soft reed but has the edge I want without 
being "over the top". It&#39;s playing very well with the older design 
Fibracell Med Soft reed.

Getting the tip rail right is still giving me a bit of grief. It 
looks a lot like the typical Dukoff rail that isn&#39;t well defined. 
There&#39;s just a little more buzz/fuzz in the sound than I&#39;m used to. 
I&#39;ve used a small knife to scrape behind the rail but the soft metal 
is too easy to dig into. Silveite is not the easiest stuff to work 
on. I&#39;ll keep trying.

Thanks again for your help!
Jon Lloyd

            <pre class='message__body'>It may help to sharpen the knife if it is dull.  It does kind of create
ridges when you scrape a Dukoff.  A small piece of 320 grit sandpaper will
smooth it out.  

Its a little tough to direct the sanding in the small soprano piece.  I
wrap the paper around a plastic stick for spreading glue that has a 1/8"
wide flat end.
