            <pre class='message__body'>hello to all,
I asked jerry Bergonzi some information about his mpc.
here is his reply,
ciao a tutti, Filippo

Hello Filippo,  I use an 8 link that I bought out of the store 10 years ago.  It has a slightly longer facing than average.  It does not have much baffle.  Over the years it has become much longer in it&#39;s facing and I am looking for another that I like to play.  The first thing I look for when I try a mouthpiece is how it articulates and plays the time.  Sometimes they speak too quick and sometimes they respond too slow.  It measures about 108 at the tip.  The curve is about 18+, 25, 30, 39, and 51.  It use to be 18, 24, 29, 38 and 50.  Best Wishes  Jerry</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>Any idea if the Link 8&#39;s tip opening is on "spec" at .110"?

I wonder what the curve looks like from zero to 18?  I bet that part 
of the curve is important to Jerry, but he has not recorded it.
