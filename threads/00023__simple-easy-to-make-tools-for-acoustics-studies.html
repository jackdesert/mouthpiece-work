 "What a dumb question.  Do you think I somehow drilled a curved 
hole in each of those wooden beads?"

Dumb is as dumb does.  

If the beads are solid, you will have a pipe cleaner, measuring straight line segments, which perhaps won&#39;t approximate a 45 degree arc very accurately.  If the beads are hollow, then a spring steel wire will stay centered and form a perfectly gradual bend.

I think an apology is in order.

            <pre class='message__body'>If that is the case, then I strongly suggest that you find  hollow
wooden beads as opposed to solid beads with a hole in the center in all
the appropriate sizes, install your spring steel wire through them and
actually build a neck measuring device yourself.

Having actually done the work of making and using these devices which
keeps the "measuring wire" as close as possible to the center of the
neck, especially at the bends where it is most critical,  I know the
measurement to be far more accurate than molding a wire to the shape on
the outside of the neck.  The alto device actually uses a fairly stiff
nylon line threaded on each  end that is used to attach a viola tail
piece.  I&#39;m still looking for one that is long enough for the tenor that
has enough flexibility to go around its curves and bends.  The cello one
I tried is too stiff.

The fact is if hollow beads were used there would be much more room for
the wire to move inside the beads as the  wire is pushed and pulled,
giving a wide range of measurements when attempting to measure the
length of the neck.  As a result it would actually be less accurate than
the style described.

You asked:

"Does the pipe cleaner then become a series of straight segments, with a
bend between each adjacent pair of beads, or does it form a gradual
bend?

Anyone with a modicum of common sense knows that round wooden beads from
a craft store have straight holes drilled through a solid wooden sphere.
Hence, that was a dumb question---the intent of which was to launch yet
another tiresome and repetitive argument that  my measurements are not
up to your standards of scientific accuracy.

Actually Readers, the circular objects do not have to be made from wood.  Plastic will work.  Soft rubber cylinders would be better, since they would form to the shape of the neck.  That&#39;s what I use.  

Going back to basic geometry, the rigid straight line segments will intersect the center-line arc at one point only.  All other points will be outside the arc, resulting in measurements in considerable excess of the actual center-line length.  The diameter of the "bead" hole will normalize the error to a very small degree, but not enough to make the results accurate.  The larger the bead, the more excessive the error, and one would use the largest beads in the bent section of the neck.

I prefer to use silicone rubber cylinders and cones as they form to the shape of the tube.  John can use whatever he wants.

Should we even be trying to measure the length via the center-line?   The wave travels in a a straight line.

Given Lance&#39;s scholarly analysis and critique of the neck measuring tool I made , I thought it would be fun to graphically show the difference such a big fuss is being made about.  One more time logic and reason are the apparent casualties of the quest for absolute scientific accuracy to the nth degree in all things no matter how foolish it appears.  Enjoy.

Another Example of Taking Measurements to an Illogical Extreme

            <pre class='message__body'>First, though, not for the first time at all, I would like to decide for
my self what is insignificant and what isn&#39;t, rather than have you do it
for me.  I&#39;d prefer to see all the data.

Statement #1

If you want data, go to  Missing cone volume study
&lt;http://jbtsaxmusic.homestead.com/Missing_Cone_Volume_Comparison_Study-R&#92;
evised.pdf>    it has the formulas that use the measured length of  the
neck.   Add or subtract .1 mm, .2 mm, .3 mm to the length of the neck
and work through the equations for angle of slope, length of missing
cone, and volume of missing cone (as I have many times) to see the
effects of such an insignificant change in length measurement has on the
outcomes.

Second:neither of your illustrations will provide accurate measurements.

Statement #2

This is a true statement but also a deliberately misleading one as well.
Accurate by what definition of tolerance?  Rounded to the nearest
millimeter?  Rounded to the nearest 1/10 mm or 1/100 mm.  How about to
the micron, or to the nano-gnat&#39;s ass?  The real question, is for the
use of the measurement which is to find the "approximation" of the
missing cone, which accuracy of measurement is sufficient for that
purpose.   Insisting that the degree of accuracy of the measurement go
well beyond that which is sufficient for the intended purpose of the
measurement in the first place is an intellectually dishonest argument
lacking in both logic and reason.  It is this arguing about the accuracy
of measurements taken to an illogical extreme that has wasted so much
time in these discussions.

As I mentioned, there is only one point on the straight line segments of
A, B, and C, (a point in the middle of the segment) which intersects the
arc. The entry/exit holes in the beads are outside the arc, so the
measurement results will be too long.

This argument falls flat on its face when one looks at the illustration
carefully and sees that it is actually the entry and exit holes of the
beads that intersect the hypothetical arch.  It is the point at the
center of the arch that would lie beyond the limits of the narrow hole
through the bead.  Not that it matters.  See statements #1, #2.

The curved line, as John illustrated it, is even worse.  The wire going
through A, B, and C has no points intersecting the arc.  For the hollow
bead scenario to be accurate, the entry/exit holes in A, B, and C, must
be sized proportionally to the radius of the arc.  A small matter to
calculate.  If the rest of the bead holes have a close tolerance on the
wire, and the wire is not pulled too tightly, then it will provide a
very accurate center-line measurement.

This statement  represents more of the same old gibberish and nonsense. 
In the hypothetical "hollow" beads in the illustration showing the
curved line that represents Lance&#39;s "ideal" measuring tool the "wire" as
he calls it is the arch.  Lance says the wire has no points even
intersecting the arch.  That is just strange thinking by any stretch of
the imagination.

I prefer to use silicone rubber cylinders and cones as they form to the
shape of the tube.

If such a device exists, then post a picture an let us all see it.

John can use whatever he wants.

I was going to insert a condom joke here, but decided against it since
this is a family friendly forum. :)

Should we even be trying to measure the length via the center-line? The
wave travels in a a straight line.

This question in and of  itself demonstrates a total lack of
understanding of the fundamentals of acoustics and wavelengths in
particular.   Sound actually can be heard around corners and travels
very nicely through bent tubes like a French Horn.

I am going through this absolute waste of time tap dance to make a
point.  This is the same type of nit picking argumentative discussion
forwarded by Lance on the original mouthpiece forum that helped to
"poison the well" and get the discussion moved.

It is the same type of "argumentum adnausium" over insignificant and
illogical details that wastes everyone&#39;s time and keeps a discussion
from moving forward.   It may appear to some that arguing over such
minute details demonstrates one&#39;s level of intelligence and
understanding of the subject, but in reality the opposite is true.  When
one truly  has a thorough understanding of a subject, it affords them
the wisdom and common sense to know what details are important in a
given area and which are not.

Statement #3

Unfortunately just having a head full of facts and information about
acoustics, does not automatically give one the ability to use that
information in a logical manner and to form reasonable conclusions based
upon the facts and information at hand.

It is my hope that Lance can ultimately come to see the futility in his
esoteric nit picking style of argument in these "informal acoustic
discussions" and make a good faith effort to contribute in ways that
actually moves the discussion forward instead of becoming yet another
"chase your tail while having a pissing contest" thread.

Your beads A-C give you 3 tangents to the curve. You can apporximate the acutal length better by modelling that curve, then calculating the length of that section and subtract the difference between it and the tangents you have from the total length.  

OTOH, using hollow beads and a spring steel wire like Lance suggests is a more elegant solution.  It also has the advantage of being workable for a tenor neck as well, which is a much less straightforward curve to model. 

Or make a silicon mold of the neck and mesure it?

The fact is if hollow beads were used there would be much more room for the wire to move inside the beads as the  wire is pushed and pulled, giving a wide range of measurements when attempting to measure the length of the neck.  As a result it would actually be less accurate than the style
 described.

You asked:  

"Does the pipe cleaner then become a series of straight segments, with a bend between each adjacent pair of beads, or does it form a gradual bend?  

Anyone with a modicum of common sense knows that round wooden beads from a craft store have straight holes drilled through a solid wooden sphere.   Hence, that was a dumb question---the intent of which was to launch yet another tiresome and repetitive argument that  my measurements are not up to
 your standards of scientific accuracy.

            <pre class='message__body'>This spreadsheet
&lt;http://jbtsaxmusic.homestead.com/Missing_cone_spreadsheet.pdf>   shows
the mathematically insignificant effects of a .1 mm difference in the
measured length of the neck in the study in question.

At this time I do not have the skill in trigonometry to calculate the
difference between the length of the arc and the "cord" inside each
bead.  In my illustration, I have laid the curved line over the line
with several kinked segments and have seen no significant difference in
length.

If one were to try to use hollow beads as Lance suggests, even if they
can be found in the sizes necessary, they would quickly find that the
lateral movement  allowed the wire inside the bead would produce wildly
different readings when the wire is tightened or loosened just a small
amount.

not standing waves, nor are they contained in an airtight cylindrical or

This first link shows several different types of longitudinal waves.  
If you can imagine the longitudinal wave at the top going around a 45
degree curve in its "tube", that would replicate what happens inside an
alto sax neck.  If you look down to the "water wave" you will see that
it behaves in a different way entirely.

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually Lance that wouldn&#39;t work.  On the top of the neck you have the
octave pip, the octave key guide cradle, the octave key hinge post
assembly that are in the way of getting an accurate measurement.  On the
bottom of most necks you have the brace that extends out from the
surface.  For being a stickler for accuracy, I&#39;m surprised you
overlooked these common attributes of a sax neck.

Waves in the open air propagate in straight lines from their source .  
Standing waves in an enclosed tube follow the contours of the bends in
the tube.  A sound wave is not at all like the single curved line with
humps and valleys that represents a sine wave in the common
illustrations.  A sound wave in an enclosed tube  is also not like a
billiard ball that strikes a hard surface and then bounces off at an
equal but opposite angle.

The bottom line is that the sounding length or acoustic length of a wind
instrument is the geometric length of its tubing, which means the length
of an imaginary string that runs through the center, plus adjustments
for closed tone holes,  sharp bends in the tubing, and end corrections. 
Measuring the path of the soundwave through a neck as though it were a
billiard ball going straight till it hits a wall is just plain silly.

John,

The saxophone is not airtight.  It is open at the big end.  The impedance of the air at the open end or open tone hole causes the reflection back to the mouthpiece.  Not a solid, airtight wall.

Actually Lance, water waves are a very poor analogy to use.  They are not standing waves, nor are they contained in an airtight cylindrical or conical tube.   

This first link shows several different types of longitudinal waves.   If you can imagine the longitudinal wave at the top going around a 45 degree curve in its "tube", that would replicate what happens inside an alto sax neck.  If you look down to the "water wave" you will see that it behaves in a different way entirely.

Longitudinal Wave Motion 

The very  best representation of pressure and displacement nodes and anti nodes I have found can be seen at this link.

Nodes and antinodes

On the top of the neck you have the octave pip, the octave key guide cradle, the octave key hinge post assembly that are in the way of getting an accurate measurement.  On the bottom of most necks you have the brace that extends out from the surface.  For being a stickler for accuracy, I&#39;m surprised you overlooked these common attributes of a sax neck.

  Waves in the open air propagate in straight lines from their source .   Standing waves in an enclosed tube follow the contours of the bends in the tube.  A sound wave is not at all like the single curved line with humps and valleys that represents a sine wave in the common illustrations.  A sound wave in an enclosed tube  is also not like a billiard ball that strikes a hard surface and then bounces off at an equal but opposite angle.  

  The bottom line is that the sounding length or acoustic length of a wind instrument is the geometric length of its tubing, which means the length of an imaginary string that runs through the center, plus adjustments for closed tone holes,  sharp bends in the tubing, and end corrections.  Measuring the path of the soundwave through a neck as though it were a billiard ball going straight till it hits a wall is just plain silly.

  Come on Toby---really. Have you actually tried this or are you just imagining doing it in your head. Take your string and do what you suggest measuring the neck that way and doing the numerous calculations to compensate and then let me know how that works out for you. 

  Better yet, you measure a neck that way and tell me what kind of neck it is and I will find one and do the same and then we will compare results and the time it took to do the measurement.

I think an enclosed tube can 
have only one standing wave, and that wave is stationary. 



"A sound wave in an enclosed tube  is 
also not 
like a billiard ball
 that strikes a hard surface and then bounces off at an equal but 
opposite angle."



Newton&#39;s first law does not cease to apply in a closed tube, and it 
applies equally to air molecules as is does to billiard balls.  The wave
 will travel, from it&#39;s source, in a straight line until acted upon by 
an unbalanced force, including effects of friction and viscosity.  It 
can be absorbed, reflected (as per a billiard ball - angle of incidence =
 angle of reflection, diffracted (complex reflections), or refracted 
(bent by passing through mediums of different density). 



Clearly the energy does not move around the bend in the same orderly 
fashion demonstrated in your straight tube animations, which did show 
"billiard ball type" reflection by the way.   



Perhaps you have some models of wave propagation in bent tubes.

What about all of the waves of the harmonics of the fundamental?

How can a sound wave be "stationary" and travel at 345 meters per
second?

Clearly the energy does not move around the bend in the same orderly
fashion demonstrated in your straight tube animations, which did show
"billiard ball type" reflection by the way.

The wave comprised of vibrating air molecules is nothing at all like a
straight line that bounces off the side of the neck like a billiard
ball.  The tube is filled with a column of air.  The soundwave is the
vibration of air molecules within that column of air and therefore takes
the shape of that column of air.

I seriously doubt that there is "billiard ball type" of reflection of
air molecules hitting each other in the vibrating air column due to the
very thin density of the air.

Newton says that the energy moves through the molecules, regardless of the confining shape, in a straight line, not withstanding the effects of the aforementioned unbalanced forces - the energy will travel in a straight line until something (the boundary layer or the wall) cause it to change direction.  This is called the Law of Inertia.  There is plenty of documentation available.  Can you provide links that support your statement?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m not going to argue this with you Lance.  It is patently absurd to waste time on this type of pointless discussion.  It is pointless because it has nothing whatsoever to do with measuring the length of the interior of a saxophone neck.  If it is your contention (and I suspect that it is) that the length the sound wave travels as it goes around the bend in the neck would be determined by adding the lengths of a series of very short straight lines ricocheting back and forth is sheer nonsense.

I gave you the illustration from Nederveen&#39;s study. That should have ended the discussion.

 "I&#39;m not going to argue this with you Lance.  It is patently 
absurd to waste time on this type of pointless discussion."

John,

You are of course, in no way obligated to respond if you find this theoretical acoustical subject a waste of your time.  You and Steve can discuss more practical subjects.  LOL.  I renamed the subject title, "sound waves in a curved tube", so you should have no problem avoiding this senseless discussion in the future.

The same applies to those silly drawings in Ferron of
waves bouncing around in a mpc. The effect of a toroidal
bend in the tube on a compression wave is well known.
You&#39;ll find the relevant info in Nederveen, as you know.

            <pre class='message__body'>I interpret the Ferron illustrations as being the centerline of a wavefront originating from a spot on the reed.  There are many more spots and paths than illustrated.  I think they are useful compared to what else has been presented.

One clear fact is that the wave cannot bounce around in
the tube since it occupies the entire space of the tube.
The same applies to those silly drawings in Ferron of
waves bouncing around in a mpc. The effect of a toroidal
bend in the tube on a compression wave is well known.
You&#39;ll find the relevant info in Nederveen, as you know.

You are right Toby.  The wave does not bounce.  The wave does nothing but hitch a ride, from one air molecule to the next.  It&#39;s those silly air molecules that do all the bouncing, and they do a lot of it inside the tube or mouthpiece. (Remember how much energy is lost to friction?)  Regardless of whether air molecules are conducting a transverse or a longitudinal wave, they have mass, and Newton&#39;s 1st Law applies to them - once they are set in motion, they travel in a straight line, unless they are affected by an unregulated force, and it is the effect of that unregulated force on each air molecule which determines the behavior of that degree of inertance of the wave  Of course, that straight journey is not very long - until it hits the neighboring air molecule or the tube wall, straight or curved, or the mouthpiece baffle or window ramp, but, they are doing pretty much nothing but "billiard balling" each other and the tube walls all the time. 
 (What causes the boundary layer anyway?)

Nederveen, p. 60, "The pattern of the waves in a cross-section of the tore is different from that in cylindrical tubes."

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice try Lance.   I didn&#39;t bring up anything about a theory.

You posted the following request after one of my statements.

"Perhaps you have some models of wave propagation in bent tubes."

I responded to that request with the illustration copied from
Nederveen&#39;s published study
"Influence of a toroidal bend on wind instrument tuning."  Unfortunately
that study is not
available for free at the ASA website unless one is a member.

You can&#39;t turn the blame  back at me for your failure to describe a
"theory" you made reference to
based on the frivolous argument that it came from a theoretical paper,
and therefore it must be
a theory that I brought up in the first place.  That is just plain
silly.  Why don&#39;t you just admit that
you had nothing to back up your statement about Nederveen&#39;s theory and
low frequencies and
move on.  Your credibility will be the better for it.

We are all wrong on occasion---albeit some more than others.   [:)]

Theories have words and equations.  I ask again. What is Nederveen&#39;s
theory?  You brought it up. Don&#39;t you know what it is?  How do you know
it applies only to low frequencies if you can&#39;t even state what it says?

            <pre class='message__body'>Apparently the boundary layer is caused by thermal and
viscous losses of energy--transfers from the kinetic
energy of the air molecules to the walls of the tube,
which are then dissipated as heat. Those losses rob the
standing wave of about 90-odd percent of its power,
meaning that we have to keep blowing to keep replacing
that lost energy.

            <pre class='message__body'>According the the studies I have read, the reed modulates
an air jet which travels the length of the reed channel
*attached to the wall*, and which eventually separates
from the wall and dissipates in a series of turbulence
vortexes. Meanwhile the modulated air jet--the "puffs" of
air as Benade calls them--have initiated the actual
wavefront that travels the length of the tube and forms
the basis for the standing wave. This model really leaves
no room for any kind of "bouncing" as Ferron pictures it.
If Ferron&#39;s conception is not accurate it cannot be
useful.

I figured that since you were a member and apparently had a copy of the publication (since you provided the diagram, unavailable elsewhere) that you would explain what the diagram means.  A summation in your own words would not be a violation of copyright.  

Regardless, though the publication is not available to non-asa members, it would appear that reviews and summaries of it are available, in more recently published studies.  Even in his earlier book (section 37, page 60) he reminds us of the complications resulting from the wavelength of a resonance being even remotely close to any of the dimensions of the tore (length for example).  His diagram is not a model of actual wave motion through the bend, as the previous animated models intend to portray.  It is a theoretical decomposition of the cross-section of the bend into independent parallel 2-dimensional layers, which he then integrates over a cross sectional area of the 3-dimensional bend, from which he predicts the inertance change, for bends with the radius of curvature r >/= 0.6D, in the limit of low frecuencies. (my cue is broken lol)

They refer to Nederveen&#39;s study as his "Theory", as, believe it or not, it is purely theoretical.

Nice try Lance.   I didn&#39;t bring up anything about a theory.

You posted the following request after one of my statements. 

"Perhaps you have some models of wave propagation in bent tubes."

I responded to that request with the illustration copied from Nederveen&#39;s published study 
"Influence of a toroidal bend on wind instrument tuning."  Unfortunately that study is not
available for free at the ASA website unless one is a member.

You can&#39;t turn the blame  back at me for your failure to describe a "theory" you made reference to
based on the frivolous argument that it came from a theoretical paper, and therefore it must be
a theory that I brought up in the first place.  That is just plain silly.  Why don&#39;t you just admit that
you had nothing to back up your statement about Nederveen&#39;s theory and low frequencies and
move on.  Your credibility
 will be the better for it.  

We are all wrong on occasion---albeit some more than others.

Nederveen&#39;s theory that you made reference to, and tell how that theory specifically applies to the argument that you are making to support your main point in this discussion.

While you are at it, please remind all of us what that point actually is and what it has to do with measuring the geometric length of a saxophone neck. Somehow I have missed that in the discussion.

There is an well known debate tactic that if you can&#39;t defeat your opponent with facts and information you try to baffle them with B.S. I&#39;m starting to get a whiff of that in this argument, if you get my drift.  :)

According the the studies I have read, the reed modulates
an air jet which travels the length of the reed channel
*attached to the wall*, and which eventually separates
from the wall and dissipates in a series of turbulence
vortexes. 

KB> This just the describes the flow of air (or any fluid) inside or around an irregular object.  There is always a "no slip" where the fluid meets the wall.  The boundary layer is the thickness of the layer near the wall where the fluid velocity isr amping up from zero near the wall to the velocity of the main flow.  I only mentioned this detail since there was also a recent question on what a boundary layer is.  I agree this is going on in a sax mouthpiece.  But I do not see a connection with acoustics in this statement.  

Meanwhile the modulated air jet--the "puffs" of
air as Benade calls them--have initiated the actual
wavefront that travels the length of the tube and forms
the basis for the standing wave. 

KB> I have read this and agree with it.  I just think acoustic waves from those puffs can reflect off a baffle.

This model really leaves
no room for any kind of "bouncing" as Ferron pictures it.
If Ferron&#39;s conception is not accurate it cannot be
useful.

KB> I see the "bouncing" paths as partial reflections of the waves.  What do you think accounts for the differences in the frequency spectrums he shows for the mouthpiece designs he compares?

As per Nederveen, (p. 41) reed motion can be seen as a widening of the bore over the length that is bound by the reed.  In actuality, as the reed vibrates, it causes a cyclical, position dependent, widening and contraction of the bore.  As such, the volume and the frs of the substitution is never constant, varying between that of the reed in it&#39;s closed state, to that of the reed in it&#39;s most open state.  This range of reed compliance then should be important to us then, as 50% of it and it&#39;s affect on frs, would be the least acceptable margin of error for our volume and frs measurements if we wish to achieve optimal results.

According the the studies I have read, the reed modulates

an air jet which travels the length of the reed channel

*attached to the wall*, and which eventually separates

from the wall and dissipates in a series of turbulence

vortexes. 



KB> This just the describes the flow of air (or any fluid) inside or around an irregular object.  There is always a "no slip" where the fluid meets the wall.  The boundary layer is the thickness of the layer near the wall where the fluid velocity isr amping up from zero near the wall to the velocity of the main flow.  I only mentioned this detail since there was also a recent question on what a boundary layer is.  I agree this is going on in a sax mouthpiece.  But I do not see a connection with acoustics in this statement.  



Meanwhile the modulated air jet--the "puffs" of

air as Benade calls them--have initiated the actual

wavefront that travels the length of the tube and forms

the basis for the standing wave. 



KB> I have read this and agree with it.  I just think acoustic waves from those puffs can reflect off a baffle.



This model really leaves

no room for any kind of "bouncing" as Ferron pictures it.

If Ferron&#39;s conception is not accurate it cannot be

useful.



KB> I see the "bouncing" paths as partial reflections of the waves.  What do you think accounts for the differences in the frequency spectrums he shows for the mouthpiece designs he compares?

Exactly.  This effect also called the "reed compliance"  is what causes
the effective or equivalent volume of the mouthpiece when played to be
greater than its measured geometric volume along with the effect of the
player&#39;s oral cavity.

In actuality, as the reed vibrates, it causes a cyclical, position
dependent, widening and contraction of the bore.

Right again.  The rapid up and down motion of the reed causes a
fluctuation in the volume that takes place hundreds of times a second
depending upon the frequency of the fundamental of the tone being
produced.  The volume added to the geometric volume that creates the
equivalent volume of the mouthpiece that results from this rapid
oscillation  can be determined by its effect upon the played frequency. 
In Benade and Gebler&#39;s study of a soprano sax mouthpiece FMA p.466 the
mean of the equivalent volumes measured was 31% greater than the
physical volume.  In my test of the Rousseau 4R alto mouthpiece, it was
28%.

As such, the volume and the frs of the substitution is never
constant,varying between that of the reed in it&#39;s closed state, to that
of thereed in it&#39;s most open state.

Right again.  However it is essential to remember this is happening
hundreds of times per second.

This range of reed compliance then should be important to us then, as50%
of it and it&#39;s affect on frs, would be the least acceptable marginof
error for our volume and frs measurements if we wish to achieveoptimal
results.

Once again a series of true statements is followed by a very illogical
and unreasonable deduction.  The fallacious argument category here is
named "It Does Not Follow" or in Latin Non Sequitur
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_%28logic%29>

The reasoning that since in stop time measured at hundredths of a second
that the volume inside the mouthpiece fluctuates between value X and
value Y due to the opening and closing of the reed,  it follows that the
difference between the two would represent the "margin of error" in
measurements of the frequency produced is absurd.

If this were true each steady long tone played on a saxophone would
contain a Frequency Modulation relative to the rapid change in
mouthpiece volume.  Obviously it does not---which means that the
equivalent volume of the mouthpiece  when played represents a fixed and
steady value for each given note and not a series of volume changes that
creates some kind of "margin of error".

It is important, class 101, in this discussion, to differentiate between the rapidly fluctuating reed compliance due to the oscillation of the reed, from that due to embouchure tension and adjustment. 
 Compliance is
 compliance, but here we are
 concerned with the former
 exclusively.

"Right again.  However it is essential to remember this is happening

Unimportant.  The fact that it does happen is what is important.

"If this were true each steady long tone played on a saxophone would 
contain a Frequency Modulation relative
 to the rapid change in mouthpiece volume.  Obviously it does not..."

Something else is obvious.  You may want to go stick you head in a bucket there, "Teach"......  Of course the long tone has many modulations relative to the rapid changes in mouthpiece volume.  Due to the way we perceive sound, and the fact that the modulations are cyclical, we recognize the cycle itself as the pitch or the frequency of the tone - thus, for example, the terminology: 440 cycles per second.  The repeating modulations that occur within that cycle are perceived as timbre, tone, waveform modulation, or coupled fn harmonic resonances. More later....

            <pre class='message__body'>Here are some definitions of basic terms that may be helpful in this
discussion

Reed compliance

The elasticity of the reed that allows it to vibrate.  Compliance
&lt;http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/saxacoustics.html#compliance>   is the
opposite of "stiffness".  A soft reed has more "compliance" than a hard
reed and therefore moves farther.  This wider path of motion increases
the effective volume inside the mouthpiece and also lowers the pitch
especially on higher notes.  Joe Wolfe wrote in a private communication
that the stiffness of a tenor reed can make as much as 2 ml difference
in the "effective volume" of the mouthpiece.

Reed dampening

In actual playing due to the curvature of the lay, the pressure of the
players lip and its position on the reed have a direct  effect upon the
compliance of the saxophone reed
&lt;http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/saxacoustics.html#reed>  .  As one bites
harder the effective length of the reed (the portion allowed to vibrate)
becomes shorter and therefore the reed becomes stiffer.   Under actual
playing conditions the dampening effect of the lip on the reed in
conjunction with the reed&#39;s natural compliance (degree of stiffness)
together determine the amount of volume added to the geometric volume of
the mouthpiece to produce its "effective" or "equivalent" volume.

Sound waves

Sound &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound>   is a traveling wave which
is an oscillation of pressure (not frequency)  transmitted through a
solid, liquid or gas composed of frequencies within the range of hearing
and of a level sufficiently strong to be heard.

Modulation

In electronics modulation &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation>   is
the process of varying one or more properties of high frequency periodic
waveform, called the carrier signal, with respect to a modulating
signal.   In music "modulation" can also refer to changing key.

Frequency Modulation

In telecommunications,  frequency modulation
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation>   (FM) conveys
information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency.  The only time
one would find "frequency modulation" in a saxophone tone would be when
a lip vibrato is used.

Frs

As used by Benade in his text "Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics"  the
term Frs refers specifically to the Frequency of the (oboe) reed on its
staple.  The equivalent on the bassoon is the frequency of the reed on
its bocal, and on the saxophone, the frequency of the mouthpiece on its
neck.   The term Frs coined by Benade should not be confused with the
natural resonant frequency of the mouthpiece, oboe reed, or bassoon reed
alone.

It is hoped these definitions clear up any misunderstandings on this
topic.

modulations relative to the rapid changes in mouthpiece volume.Â  Due
to the way we perceive sound, and the fact that the modulations are
cyclical, we recognize the cycle itself as the pitch or the frequency of
the tone - thus, for example, the terminology: 440 cycles per
second.Â  The repeating modulations that occur within that cycle are
perceived as timbre, tone, waveform modulation, or coupled fn harmonic
resonances. More later....

        Ferron compared the vibrating reed to a steel bar clamped in a vise, which had been struck with a hammer causing transverse pressure waves travelling perpendicular to the bar&#39;s surface.  This would be the case with the reed were the space not low pressure and the reed&#39;s movement caused by a different force.......

          Yes indeed, the reed is nothing but a flow control valve, reacting to the pressure differential between the mouth and the instrument bore, according to its mechanical properties. That really seems to put the nail in the coffin for old Monsieur Ferron.

          I strongly recommend a perusal of this very good paper, which illustrates the paucity of Ferron&#39;s vision on this.

  I really believe that this discussion has gone off track into a maze of
  very interesting, but irrelevant detail. The following statements are
  true.

  1. The mouthpiece of a saxophone acts as a substitution for the
  missing cone.

  2. In order for the instrument to "play properly" the effective volume
  of the mouthpiece must match that of the missing cone.

  3. The "effective" or "equivalent" volume of the mouthpiece is always
  greater than it&#39;s geometric volume due to the compliance (elasticity) of
  the reed and the effects of the player&#39;s oral cavity.

  4. The effective volume of a mouthpiece can be calculated by measuring
  the change in frequency of a cylinder from its natural resonant
  frequency when the mouthpiece is added and determining what volume in
  terms of length would need to be added to the original cylinder to
  produce an identical pitch.

  The changes in the mouthpiece volume by each opening and closing
  movement of the reed can neither be measured nor easily calculated due
  to the variables involved and the extremely exacting measurements
  required. To me it is like trying to determine the speed of an
  automobile by examining each small movement of the pistons and

            <pre class='message__body'>This would well explain why a more compliant reed lowers the frequencies of the impedance maxima. It&#39;s worth remembering that the volume with reed closed is the same for a hard or soft reed, so the "reed open" volume obviously is quite significant in determining the effective volume of the whole shebang.

        The reed is closed at the very least, 25% of the time, during which there is no "equivalent mouthpiece volume" at all.  The resonance of the cavity + constriction (frs) exists in the "reed closed" period exclusively.  While the open reed is coupled to the body resonances, the position of the reed tip is to a great extend determined by the compression anti-nodqe of each individual resonance as reflections are made at the reed.  Just how much the exact open reed position affects the effective volume is unclear, but certainly it would play some roll due to impedance differences inside and outside the mouthpiece. 

        I think we could say that we have a functional equivalent volume range, and as a result, an influenced frs, which fluctuates between that of the reed closed state and that of the reed max open state.  This means that we need to keep the entire range within the confines of what works for volume and frs.

I initiated this thread as the theoretical subject interested me, and still does.   As such, unless you have made yourself forum moderator, it&#39;s really not your place to say what is or isn&#39;t on track or relevant here (Stevie).  This is a forum for entertaining theoretical ideas, and I intend to do just that.  If you need to keep repeating endlessly, your version of the established general acoustical truths, which we are all more than familiar with, please do it in your own thread.

Agreed except for the fact that the reed compliance 
makes a significant difference in the positions of the impedance maxima; 
therefore a way must be found to correlate the reed compliance with the effect 
with the effective volume--since it clearly matters...

  I really believe that this discussion has gone off track into a maze 
  of
very interesting, but irrelevant detail. The following statements 
  are
true.

1. The mouthpiece of a saxophone acts as a substitution 
  for the
missing cone.

2. In order for the instrument to "play 
  properly" the effective volume
of the mouthpiece must match that of the 
  missing cone.

3. The "effective" or "equivalent" volume of the 
  mouthpiece is always
greater than it&#39;s geometric volume due to the 
  compliance (elasticity) of
the reed and the effects of the player&#39;s oral 
  cavity.

4. The effective volume of a mouthpiece can be calculated by 
  measuring
the change in frequency of a cylinder from its natural 
  resonant
frequency when the mouthpiece is added and determining what volume 
  in
terms of length would need to be added to the original cylinder 
  to
produce an identical pitch.

The changes in the mouthpiece volume 
  by each opening and closing
movement of the reed can neither be measured 
  nor easily calculated due
to the variables involved and the extremely 
  exacting measurements
required. To me it is like trying to determine the 
  speed of an
automobile by examining each small movement of the pistons 
  and
crankshaft in stop time rather than just measuring the end product 
  of
all of the motor&#39;s complex moving parts which is the forward motion 
  of
the car, with a speedometer.

            <pre class='message__body'>On a saxophone, the "reed closed"/"reed open" ratio becomes larger, the shorter the sounding tube length becomes.  When the reed closes, the tube becomes a closed resonating chamber with a fixed volume and stays that way for the length of time it takes the rarefaction to travel 1/2 the mouthpiece + constriction resonance (frs) wavelength (actual - rarefaction from reed to constriction, partial reflection as compression wave back to reed.  theoretical - truncation to apex and back).  As all fn resonances share the mouthpiece compression anti-node, all fn resonances are affected, for that
 length of time and on
 that related portion of
 their wavelength. The
 regime will balance itself
 accordingly. 
 

If we could play a long tone, and gradually reduce the mouthpiece volume, the first place we would notice the effects of too little volume, would be during this "reed closed" phase.  The regime would become increasingly unbalanced as the resonance peaks shifted further from integral, until it would not form at all during that period, perhaps stopping tone production completely - the reed closes and won&#39;t open again.  

If we could then gradually increase the mouthpiece volume, past that of the ideal, the same resonance shift and regime degradation would first happen during the "reed open" phase.

So, we have a functional mouthpiece volume range that must be satisfied at both extremes, for optimal results.

Yes indeed, the reed is nothing but a flow control valve, reacting to the pressure differential between the mouth and the instrument bore, according to its mechanical properties. That really seems to put the nail in the coffin for old Monsieur Ferron.

I strongly recommend a perusal of this very good paper, which illustrates the paucity of Ferron&#39;s vision on this.

Ferron&#39;s idea would be accurate were the area under the reed not a low pressure area - a relative vacuum.  The reed is being pulled closed by this "vacuum", so there is nothing for it to push or compress.

In response to: "The changes in the mouthpiece volume 
  by each opening and closing
movement of the reed can neither be 
measured 
  nor easily calculated due to the variables involved and the 
extremely 
  exacting measurements required."



  


...and for those who&#39;s minds are uncomfortable in the theoretical, the so-called "exacting measurements"

 


which "can neither be measured nor easily calculated", are in fact, child&#39;s play:

1. Minimal functional volume: measure the mouthpiece volume with the reed taped closed
2. Maximum functional volume: measure the equivalent mouthpiece volume as per Benade.

These 2 simple measurements give us the range of functional effective volume of our mouthpiece and for optimal performance, our theoretical volume should fall at the midpoint or perhaps, somewhere within that range, inversely proportional to the average truncation ratio of the instrument&#39;s normal range.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for that observation Keith.  My comment was taken straight from
Benade.  I may be wrong but my understanding at this point in time is
reflected in these statements.

1.  The "effective" volume of the mouthpiece is the composite of its
physical geometric volume beyond the neck and the interrelated effects
of the motion of the reed, the player&#39;s embouchure, and oral cavity.

2.  This "effective" volume acts as the surrogate for the missing cone.

3.  This "effective" volume determines the pitch that is sounded by
defining the length of the missing cone to its apex.

4.  The "effective" volume can be made smaller by:
a.  pushing the mouthpiece farther onto the cork
b.  taking less mouthpiece into the mouth
c.  using a harder reed
d.  biting down more on the reed
e.  using a mouthpiece with a smaller chamber in the same position on
the cork

5.  The "effective" volume can be made larger by:
a.  pulling the mouthpiece farther off the cork
b.  taking more mouthpiece into the mouth
c.  using a softer reed
d.  using a more relaxed embouchure
e.  using a mouthpiece with a larger chamber  in the same position on
the cork

6.  When the "effective" volume is less than the volume required by the
missing cone
a.  the instrument plays sharp
b.  the octaves are too wide making notes sharper in the second octave
c.  the cause is one or more of the actions described in statement #4.
d.  the solution is one or more of the actions described in statement #5

7.  When the "effective" volume is more than the volume required by the
missing cone
a.  the instrument plays flat
b.  the octaves are too narrow making notes flatter in the second octave
c.  the cause is one or more of the actions described in statement #5
d.  the solution is one or more of the actions described in statement #4

This is how I see it.  Other&#39;s mileage may vary.   [B-)]

in his

description of the effective mouthpiece volume, and that you have 
discovered an

entirely new concept that you call "functional mouthpiece volume range" 
that is

somehow more accurate?"

I think Benade&#39;s method results in an average volume, based upon the 50% "reed closed" period of a cylinder, which would be a good approximation of a conical saxophone playing it&#39;s F2, which also has a "reed closed" period of about 50%.  His method gave consistent results over the equivalent range of a soprano, however, he was using a cylindrical tube and the "reed closed" period was always approximately 50%.   I&#39;m inclined to suspect that the equivalent volume on a saxophone would be different for a low Bb than it would be for a high F.   Additionally, Benade&#39;s method gives us no idea of what functional extremes are - reed closed and reed wide open.  I would describe knowing the minimum and maximum effective volumes of the mouthpiece throughout the reed&#39;s cycle as the functional effective volume.



If the answer to the above question is yes, then how do you suppose 
Benade,

Nederveen, Fletcher, Gilbert, et.al. missed that entirely in their 
studies and

writings?"

Why, because they never had the benefit of such fresh and stimulating discourse, like we have here, of course.

A second party then either blows across the end of the tube, or taps it to get the pitch of the tube, mouthpiece, and coupled vocal tract.  A pre-warped synthetic reed could be used to simulate the reed at it&#39;s opening radius apex.

  OK.  I&#39;m starting to wrap my mind (which is still open) around this visualization of what is going on.  I have read about the reed motion as acting as a valve and have not fully appreciated what was being said.  It is being said that the reed&#39;s vibration in itself is not a major contibutor to the vibration of the air as say the vibration of a cymbal (metal in vice) or a plucked string would move the air.  The main contribution is from the reed&#39;s role in allowing the "puffs of air" into the mouthpiece that create pressure waves that "ring" the air column.  

  I still think that these acoustic pressure waves can partially reflect off the various mouthpiece interior surfaces.  But my mind is in a different place now.  Thanks Toby, Lance.

  Yes indeed, the reed is nothing but a flow control valve, reacting to the pressure differential between the mouth and the instrument bore, according to its mechanical properties. That really seems to put the nail in the coffin for old Monsieur Ferron.

  I strongly recommend a perusal of this very good paper, which illustrates the paucity of Ferron&#39;s vision on this.

    If I understand correctly, the reed closes because the space between the reed and the baffle becomes a low pressure area, so it&#39;s not as if the reed is moving the air there, rather the reverse. There would then be no air motion toward the baffle.

  Thanks for that observation Keith.  My comment was taken straight from Benade.  I may be wrong but my understanding at this point in time is reflected in these statements.

  1.  The "effective" volume of the mouthpiece is the composite of its physical geometric volume beyond the neck and the interrelated effects of the motion of the reed, the player&#39;s embouchure, and oral cavity.

  2.  This "effective" volume acts as the surrogate for the missing cone.

  3.  This "effective" volume determines the pitch that is sounded by defining the length of the missing cone to its apex.

  4.  The "effective" volume can be made smaller by:


    a.  pushing the mouthpiece farther onto the cork
    b.  taking less mouthpiece into the mouth
    c.  using a harder reed
    d.  biting down more on the reed
    e.  using a mouthpiece with a smaller chamber in the same position on the cork


  5.  The "effective" volume can be made larger by:

    a.  pulling the mouthpiece farther off the cork
    b.  taking more mouthpiece into the mouth
    c.  using a softer reed
    d.  using a more relaxed embouchure
    e.  using a mouthpiece with a larger chamber  in the same position on the cork


  6.  When the "effective" volume is less than the volume required by the missing cone

    a.  the instrument plays sharp
    b.  the octaves are too wide making notes sharper in the second octave
    c.  the cause is one or more of the actions described in statement #4.
    d.  the solution is one or more of the actions described in statement #5


  7.  When the "effective" volume is more than the volume required by the missing cone

    a.  the instrument plays flat
    b.  the octaves are too narrow making notes flatter in the second octave
    c.  the cause is one or more of the actions described in statement #5
    d.  the solution is one or more of the actions described in statement #4


  This is how I see it.  Other&#39;s mileage may vary.

    I strongly recommend a perusal of this very good paper, which illustrates the paucity of Ferron&#39;s vision on this.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have found that when a mouthpiece chamber is too large, this causes the player to push in to tune the mid-range (most likely bringing the actual volume closer to or at the needed volume) .  This causes the higher notes to sharpen more than the lower notes.  I mostly compare the palm keys to the bell notes, but I think the octaves are wider too.  This initially sounds like the opposite of what you stated, but I&#39;m not so sure as my observation has a re-tuning of the mid range in it.

A turbulent jet, which dissolves into eddies as soon as it moves a short way past the reed slit (and it is attached to the walls until that point). How can your reconcile this with Ferron&#39;s folly?

  Bad analogy for me.  Water is virtually incompressible and the standing wave (in air) is not flowing through the sax.  The pressure gradients are much different.

  I do appreciate the comment by Lance that the reed is closed due to low pressure underneath it.  The reed closing does not force a high pressure under it.

Thanks.  Another paper for my to-do list.  

I think the flow puffing creates waves of acoustic pressure that bounce off the interior walls.  That is what molecules do.  But pressure vectors originating from the reed surface is not an accurate representation.  If that is what Ferron is trying to show.  He did not really say.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lance,  with all due respect you are once again arguing something that
you have  conceptualized which cannot be proven or measured.

You speculate that the effective volume inside the mouthpiece would be
different for a low Bb and a high F on a saxophone.

How would you ever measure this and confirm your "theory" is true?

Benade writes, "In light of these facts, [findings of Weber and
Helmholtz] we can hope to represent a reed and its mouthpiece a cavity
in terms of an "equivalent" hard-walled cavity whose shape is chosen to
make its acoustical effect on the natural frequencies of an air column
identical with the composite effect of the actual reed-plus-cavity on
the playing frequencies of the air column.  It turns out that this can
be done, as long as we deal only with the frequencies well below the
reed&#39;s own natural frequency

As you can see by Benade&#39;s definition the "equivalent" volume is a fixed
value representing an equivalent hard walled cavity that would produce
the identical frequency as the composite effect of the actual reed plus
cavity under playing conditions.

Since the equivalent volume is defined as the composite effect of the
reed and other elements under playing conditions,
it follows that trying to separate, measure, and quantify each of those
elements in stop time to be completely irrelevant.

Adding the word "functional" to the term "equivalent volume" is
illogical at best since the term itself incorporates the function of
that volume under playing conditions.  One more time the discussion has
veered off onto a conceptual theory that, while somewhat interesting:

-contradicts information found in the standard acoustics literature
-has no plausible way of verification
-fails to move the discussion forward in a way that provides logical,
practical, and useful information

cylindrical tube and the "reed closed" period was always approximately
50%. Â  I&#39;m inclined to suspect that the equivalent volume on a
saxophone would be different for a low Bb than it would be for a high F.

measuring effective mouthpiece volume would probably result in some
"averaging" with the "reed closed" period of a cylinder (50%), perhaps a
better way to get the correct "maximum equivalent volume" pitch of the
mouthpiece/vocal tract, would be to have the test player form his normal
embouchure without blowing.  A second party then either blows across the
end of the tube, or taps it to get the pitch of the tube, mouthpiece,
and coupled vocal tract.  A pre-warped synthetic reed could be used to
simulate the reed at it&#39;s opening radius apex.

I am currently working on a study that attempts to compare the "equivalent" volume changes created by lipping a tone as high as possible and by moving the mouthpiece onto the cork the distance that creates the same raised pitch using a "normal" embouchure.

It is my hope to be able to demonstrate that lipping and moving the mouthpiece to produce the same pitch change do not produce a 1:1 change in "equivalent" mouthpiece volume.

This would mean that by carefully balancing the two means of changing the pitch, one would be able to match both Benade&#39;s "missing cone volume" requirement and his Frs requirement in a methodological fashion.

If this should turn out to be the case, then the mouthpiece pitch concept started by Santy Runyon and taught by Rousseau and others can be successfully integrated with the findings of Benade from his studies of conical woodwinds.

My personal interest in all of this is that if this is true, it will provide a scientific confirmation to my observations gained through teaching hundreds of saxophone students over many years and a validation of the tone production concepts that I incorporated in my teaching.

John,

As with the recent case of waveform modulation, which you claimed was impossible, (and which never got a direct response), you are wrong.

Here is my theoretical proof, Part I, which I invite anyone to show invalid.  

Benade&#39;s Equivalent Mouthpiece Volume test involves
 coupling a soprano saxophone mouthpiece to a cylindrical tube.   As such, the simple instrument assumes the acoustical characteristics of a closed cylindrical tube - similar to a clarinet.  

The length of a closed cylindrical tube
 constitutes 1/4
 the wavelength of the tube&#39;s fundamental resonance.  During the first length of the tube, the reed is open and the wave is a compression wave.  The wave reflects at the open end as a rarefaction and returns toward the reed in it&#39;s 2nd length, during which, the reed is still open.  The wave reflects at the reed as a rarefaction, causing the reed to close, and travels the 3rd length of the tube, still a rarefaction.  It reflects at the open end again as a compression wave, and makes it&#39;s 4th tube length journey in that state.  The reed is still closed.  When the wave reflects at the reed as a compression wave at the end of the 4th length, the reed opens, and the entire cycle repeats.  

So, during Benade&#39;s EMV procedure,  the reed is closed for 1/2 of each wavelength, where the wave travels 2 complete lengths of the tube, and the "volume used" of the mouthpiece is fixed (for the sake of easy comprehension, I
 will give it a volume of 100units.).  Every acoustical characteristic of those 2 tube-length trips, resonance alignment, actual 1/2 wavelength, etc., is a result of the cylindrical tube resonances coupled with that fixed mouthpiece chamber volume of 100 units.

For the other 1/2 wavelength, or 2 tube-length trips of the wave, the reed is open, and the exact volume of the mouthpiece + reed + vocal tract is an unknown "X".  Every acoustical characteristic of those 2 tube-length trips, resonance 
alignment, actual 1/2 wavelength, etc., is a result of the cylindrical 
tube resonances coupled with that unknown "X" mouthpiece volume.

We will arbitrarily take John&#39;s initial Benade EMV test results of +28% for our end result here, since it was accurate for his initial test, and will suffice for our purposes.

We can represent all this information in a nice simple mathematical formula:

100 units/half wavelength + X units/half wavelength = 128 units EMV

If we multiply both sides by 2, we get:

100 units + X units = 256 units MV

Then subtract 100 units from both sides:

X units = 156 units MV

The actual mouthpiece + reed + vocal tract volume during the "reed open" phase of the cycle is 156 units.  Benade&#39;s procedure results in an averaged actual cavity volume of 128 units, which is more precisely seen as a functional
 volume of 128 units +/- 28 units.

Let&#39;s discuss this much for now.  Part II will deal with this kind of averaging and how it applies to the saxophone

There is a jet which is modulated by the reed that travels down the reed channel attached to the walls (as close as anything comes to "bouncing"), but which very quicky detaches itself and is dissipated in turbulence vortices. It is that dissipation that allows the pressure pulses to excite the air column without disturbing the standing compression wave that is set up. This is very similar to what happens in a flute air jet, except that the pulsing is controlled by an air reed rather than a cane reed.

Ferron talks about it being "reasonable to assume..." based on his moving bar model, but as Lance points out, it is not reasonable to assume what he assumes at all, as a moving bar transmits its waves into ambient pressure with no pressure differential across it. I don&#39;t know why you insist on believing the Ferron fairy tale. It is totally disproved by the real science.

  Thanks. Another paper for my to-do list. 

  I think the flow puffing creates waves of acoustic pressure that bounce off the interior walls. That is what molecules do. But pressure vectors originating from the reed surface is not an accurate representation. If that is what Ferron is trying to show. He did not really say.

This would be true in the body of the instrument in all cases.  Do you
know for a fact that this is the case inside the mouthpiece for the
compression node that encompasses the whole length of the reed past the
window?  I would suspect that the "equivalent" volume inside the
mouthpiece having a shape, size, and length that differs somewhat from
its geometric shape and volume would have an effect.

I suppose this could be easily tested by putting an insert in the the
shank of the mouthpiece and measuring the rise in pitch and then taking
a piece of putty with the same volume, flattening it and putting it
inside the mouthpiece under the beak above the reed an taking a similar
measurement.

Anybody wish to discuss why some notes can be 
lipped much more than others? Obviously this has to do with tube impedance 
strength and therefore this needs to be considered STRONGLY. Remember that in 
science a miss is as good as a mile....so don&#39;t waste your time with studies

This is a "no brainer".

Let&#39;s simplify the scenario.   Let&#39;s consider only the resonance of the fundamental.  I am doubtful that a the node for a single resonance could encompass the whole length of the reed past the window.  Can you substantiate that?

    Bad analogy for me.  Water is virtually incompressible and the standing wave (in air) is not flowing through the sax.  The pressure gradients are much different.

    I do appreciate the comment by Lance that the reed is closed due to low pressure underneath it.  The reed closing does not force a high pressure under it.

    Think about a garden hose. When you turn it on, the water enters the hose and the pressure differential immediately causes the wavter to fill the hose. The water doesn&#39;t bounce around: it expands in all directions to fill the available space.

      OK.  I&#39;m starting to wrap my mind (which is still open) around this visualization of what is going on.  I have read about the reed motion as acting as a valve and have not fully appreciated what was being said.  It is being said that the reed&#39;s vibration in itself is not a major contibutor to the vibration of the air as say the vibration of a cymbal (metal in vice) or a plucked string would move the air.  The main contribution is from the reed&#39;s role in allowing the "puffs of air" into the mouthpiece that create pressure waves that "ring" the air column.  

      I still think that these acoustic pressure waves can partially reflect off the various mouthpiece interior surfaces.  But my mind is in a different place now.  Thanks Toby, Lance.

      Yes indeed, the reed is nothing but a flow control valve, reacting to the pressure differential between the mouth and the instrument bore, according to its mechanical properties. That really seems to put the nail in the coffin for old Monsieur Ferron.

      I strongly recommend a perusal of this very good paper, which illustrates the paucity of Ferron&#39;s vision on this.

        If I understand correctly, the reed closes because the space between the reed and the baffle becomes a low pressure area, so it&#39;s not as if the reed is moving the air there, rather the reverse. There would then be no air motion toward the baffle.

  I have found that when a mouthpiece chamber is too large, this causes the player to push in to tune the mid-range (most likely bringing the actual volume closer to or at the needed volume) .  This causes the higher notes to sharpen more than the lower notes.  I mostly compare the palm keys to the bell notes, but I think the octaves are wider too.  This initially sounds like the opposite of what you stated, but I&#39;m not so sure as my observation has a re-tuning of the mid range in it.

        In general, the shorter the wavelength, the more the note can be lipped.  Lipping will also affect the higher modes more than the fundamental, and the new amplitude/peak freq. relationships between the regime resonances can result in more pitch shift that can be attributed to the lipping alone.

          Anybody wish to discuss why some notes can be lipped much more than others? Obviously this has to do with tube impedance strength and therefore this needs to be considered STRONGLY. Remember that in science a miss is as good as a mile....so don&#39;t waste your time with studies that don&#39;t pertain.

                  "I am currently working on a study that attempts to compare the "equivalent" volume changes created by lipping a tone as high as possible and by moving the mouthpiece onto the cork the distance that creates the same raised pitch using a "normal" embouchure.

                  It is my hope to be able to demonstrate that lipping and moving the mouthpiece to produce the same pitch change do not produce a 1:1 change in "equivalent" mouthpiece volume."

                  This is a "no brainer".   Obviously the change will not be a 1:1 ratio, as lipping combines the effects of reduced volume overall + reduced volume at the compression anti-node.

      "Do you know for a fact that this is the case inside the

Let&#39;s simplify the 
        scenario.   Let&#39;s consider only the resonance of the 
        fundamental.  I am doubtful that a the node for a single resonance 
        could encompass the whole length of the reed past the window.  Can 
        you substantiate that?

            <pre class='message__body'>"Practically" means "in practice". I think you are making entirely too much of extremely small--and "in practice" indistinguishable--factors.

Aside from changing volume at a certain spot, Bernoulli effects start to become quite critical close to the reed tip. These might change the whole equation in unsuspected ways.

But if you guys like this kind of esoteric discussion, by all means have fun. The time you waste is but your own.

I would like to start a discussion on how many angels can fly kites in the reed channel of a saxophone mpc...

Let&#39;s simplify the          scenario.   Let&#39;s consider only the resonance of the          fundamental.  I am doubtful that a the node for a single resonance          could encompass the whole length of the reed past the window.

            <pre class='message__body'>My point is that the amount one can lip a note has a lot to do with the strength of the impedances, the spacing of the tube resonances and factors having nothing at all to do with the volume under the reed; so I find John&#39;s study of lipping notes and then moving the mpc to try to create an
 equivalence between effective volume under the reed and real volume in the mpc to be rather misguided in its conception--if the effects of these factors are not understood.

                            In general, the shorter the wavelength, the more the note          can be lipped.  Lipping will also affect the higher modes more than          the fundamental, and the new amplitude/peak freq. relationships between          the regime resonances can result in more
 pitch shift that can be          attributed to the lipping alone.

           Anybody wish to discuss why some notes            can be lipped much more than others? Obviously this has to do with            tube impedance strength and therefore this needs to be considered            STRONGLY. Remember that in science a miss is as good as a mile....so           
 don&#39;t waste your time with studies that don&#39;t pertain.

 the mouthpiece onto the cork the                    distance that creates the same raised pitch using a "normal"                    embouchure.

It                    is my hope to be able to demonstrate that lipping and moving                    the mouthpiece to produce the same pitch change do not produce                    a 1:1 change in "equivalent" mouthpiece                    volume."

This is a "no                    brainer".   Obviously the change will not be a 1:1                    ratio, as lipping combines the effects of reduced volume                    overall + reduced volume at the compression                    anti-node.

There is a jet which is modulated by the reed that travels down the reed channel attached to the walls (as close as anything comes to "bouncing"), but which very quicky detaches itself and is dissipated in turbulence vortices. It is that dissipation that allows the pressure pulses to excite the air column without disturbing the standing compression wave that is set up. This is very similar to what happens in a flute air jet, except that the pulsing is controlled by an air reed rather than a cane reed.
 
Ferron talks about it being "reasonable to assume..." based on his moving bar model, but as Lance points out, it is not reasonable to assume what he assumes at all, as a moving bar transmits its waves into ambient pressure with no pressure differential across it. I don&#39;t know why you insist on believing the Ferron fairy tale. It is totally disproved by the real science.

            <pre class='message__body'>This lengthy response neither measures, nor proves anything.

The definition of "equivalent" mouthpiece volume is given by Benade on
p. 466.  It is the volume of an "equivalent" hard-walled cavity that
exhibits the same acoustic effects upon the frequency of the sound wave
as does the composite effects of reed-plus-cavity under playing
conditions.

It is represented by a single value that is easily calculated.  It is
not a range of values nor an average of values.   The term "functional
equivalent volume" is redundant, since the term "equivalent volume"
already represents the reed-plus-cavity in its "functional" state.

As they say, a picture
&lt;http://jbtsaxmusic.homestead.com/Mouthpiece_equivalent_volume_not_depen&#92;
dent_on_reed_opening_and_closing.pdf>   is worth a thousand words.  
This shows why the theory of the "equivalent volume" being based upon
the opening and closing of the reed is  full of holes.

Since you bring it up my response to waveform modulation was a bit
subtle.  It was my post #104 giving a definition of terms.  After
reading that, if you still don&#39;t get it ask me again.

The wave reflects at the open end as a rarefaction and returns toward
the reed in it&#39;s 2nd length, during which, the reed is still open.  The
wave reflects at the reed as a rarefaction, causing the reed to close,
and travels the 3rd length of the tube, still a rarefaction.  It
reflects at the open end again as a compression wave, and makes it&#39;s 4th
tube length journey in that state.  The reed is still closed.  When the
wave reflects at the reed as a compression wave at the end of the 4th

 baffle and a medium chamber.  In other words, all other factors being equal, volume distribution can vary pitch almost as much as volume or length.  The tip of the reed is a compression anti--node.  Widening the bore closer to the tip will lower the pitch more than widening the bore in the back
 of the chamber.  So mouthpiece design is also a factor.

The fact that by changing my embouchure I can vary  the pitch of many notes +-1 semitone makes me suspect that there is more  involved than simply adding or subtracting a bit of effective volume under  the reed. Any ideas about that?

        Thanks for that observation Keith.  My comment was taken straight from    Benade.  I may be wrong but my understanding at this point in time is    reflected in these statements.

1.  The "effective" volume of the    mouthpiece is the composite of its physical geometric volume beyond the neck    and the interrelated effects of the motion of the reed, the player&#39;s    embouchure, and oral cavity.

2.  This "effective" volume acts as    the surrogate for the missing cone.

3.  This "effective" volume    determines the pitch that is sounded by defining the length of the missing    cone to its apex.

4.  The "effective" volume can be made smaller    by:
   
a.  pushing the mouthpiece farther onto the      cork
b.  taking less mouthpiece into the mouth
c.  using a      harder reed
d.  biting down more on the reed
e.  using a      mouthpiece with a smaller chamber in the same position on the    cork

5.  The "effective" volume can be made larger    by:
   a.  pulling the mouthpiece farther off the cork
b.       taking more mouthpiece into the mouth
c.  using a softer      reed
d.  using a more relaxed embouchure
e.  using a      mouthpiece with a larger chamber  in the same position on the      cork

6.  When the "effective" volume is less than the    volume required by the missing cone
   a.  the instrument plays sharp
b.  the octaves are      too wide making notes sharper in the second octave
c.  the cause is      one or more of the actions described in statement #4.
d.  the      solution is one or more of the actions described in statement    #5

7.  When the "effective" volume is more than the    volume required by the missing cone
   a.  the instrument plays flat
b.  the octaves are      too narrow making notes flatter in the second octave
c.  the cause      is one or more of the actions described in statement #5
d.  the      solution is one or more of the actions described in statement    #4

This is how I see it.  Other&#39;s mileage may    vary.

I&#39;ll make it simple:  The maximum "reed open" volume (1/2 cycle) is unknown.  The minimal "reed closed" volume (1/2 cycle) is known.  The average of the unknown "reed open" volume and the known "reed closed" volume is known.  From that information we can accurately figure the actual unknown "reed open" volume.

This lengthy response neither measures, nor proves anything.

The definition of "equivalent" mouthpiece volume is given by Benade on p. 466.  It is the volume of an "equivalent" hard-walled cavity that exhibits the same acoustic effects upon the frequency of the sound wave as does the composite effects of reed-plus-cavity under playing conditions.

It is represented by a single value that is easily calculated.  It is not a range of values nor an average of values.   The term "functional equivalent volume" is redundant, since the term "equivalent volume" already represents the reed-plus-cavity in its "functional" state.

As they say, a picture  is worth a thousand words.   This shows why the theory of the "equivalent volume" being based upon the opening
 and closing of the reed is  full of holes.

Since you bring it up my response to waveform modulation was a bit subtle.  It was my post #104 giving a definition of terms.  After reading that, if you still don&#39;t get it ask me again.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ok Lance.  Here is where the rubber meets the proverbial road.  You show me with a true to life example (not hypothetical) where you:

Calculate the value of and prove the "unknown open reed volume" as you call it even exists.

Show by empirical testing that in a cylinder, half the wavelength has a different length than its other half and what the listener hears is the average of the two different frequencies.

You can put a sax mouthpiece on a tube, record the sound and then do a pitch analysis of a segment that is 1 divided by twice the frequency seconds in duration.

The burden of proof is upon you to show that your theory is valid, it is not upon others to disprove it.  So far you have failed to do so.

      Ok Lance.  Here is where the rubber meets the proverbial road.  You show me with a true to life example (not hypothetical) where you:



Calculate the value of and prove the "unknown open reed volume" as you call it even exists.



Show by empirical testing that in a cylinder, half the wavelength has a different length than its other half and what the listener hears is the average of the two different frequencies.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Toby for this great topic idea.  I&#39;m giving it another title to
get out of that other "circling the drain" discussion.  I would like to
call everyone&#39;s attention to the illustration on page 2 of Steve Dukes
paper
&lt;http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/Documents/BandOrchestra/Wind_Tips_Duke.&#92;
pdf>   on tuning the saxophone.

I suspect that Professor Duke took this from an acoustic study
somewhere.  It would be great to discover the source of the illustration
to read the accompanying information.  I think that if all of the
acoustic research Mouseketeers put their efforts into it, we could come
up with the source.

During the first length of the tube, the reed is open and the wave is a
compression wave.ÃÂ  The wave reflects at the open end as a
rarefaction and returns toward the reed in it&#39;s 2nd length, during
which, the reed is still open.ÃÂ  The wave reflects at the reed as
a rarefaction, causing the reed to close, and travels the 3rd length of
the tube, still a rarefaction.ÃÂ  It reflects at the open end again
as a compression wave, and makes it&#39;s 4th tube length journey in that
state.ÃÂ  The reed is still closed.ÃÂ  When the wave reflects
at the reed as a compression wave at the end of the 4th length, the reed
opens, and the entire cycle repeats.ÃÂ

 you bring it up my response to waveform modulation was a bit subtle.  
It was my post #104 giving a definition of terms.  After reading that, 
if you still don&#39;t get it ask me again."

Post #104 - Ah.  The abridged glossary for Woodwind Acoustics 101.  A good place to start and a poor place to be stuck.   I notice there is nothing about asymmetrical waveforms, i.e., the effects of making 1/2 of a waveform different from the other half (reed open/reed closed, making 1/2 shorter than the other) in your list.  Benade did mention that waveforms are not always symmetrical, but the scope of his writing did not include much on this very relevant subject.  Those who took and understood Electronic Music 101 are more than familiar with manipulating the waveform within various parts of it&#39;s cycle and what it does to the timbre and the base pitch of the tone.  

It is obvious that you only care to discuss those issues which 
fall within the scope of, and agree with, your very limited list of 
acoustical terms and concepts.  Anything outside of that or contrary to 
your view, you label as "impossible", "irrelevant",  "unmeasurable", or 
"drain circling", and usualy prompts another mindless repetition of your 
abridged glossary of terms.  I suggest that you do some reviewing of the basic acoustical properties of waveforms.

"It sounds like you are trying to weasel out of the challenge already."

Lol.  The proof I provided twice is self-evident for anyone with the slightest knowledge of the additive nature of waveforms.  I think a few digitally captured and measured waveform examples will suffice.

            <pre class='message__body'>That&#39;s all very interesting Lance.  Can you provide any reference to a
source  that discusses asymmetrical acoustic pressure waves and/or
taking the average of two different "half wave lengths" of an acoustic
pressure wave and then doubling that to produce the resulting frequency?

I believe all the information in the world to be useless, if the
knowledge and understanding of how to apply that information is lacking.

I will wait with bated breath your digitally captured waveform showing 
that the wave of a long tone played on a cylindrical tube with a
saxophone mouthpiece has an asymmetric waveform for its fundamental and
each of its odd numbered overtones.

good place to start and a poor place to be stuck.   I notice there is
nothing about asymmetrical waveforms, i.e., the effects of making 1/2 of
a waveform different from the other half (reed open/reed closed, making
1/2 shorter than the other) in your list.  Benade did mention that
waveforms are not always symmetrical, but the scope of his writing did
not include much on this very relevant subject.  Those who took and
understood Electronic Music 101 are more than familiar with manipulating
the waveform within various parts of it&#39;s cycle and what it does to the
timbre and the base pitch of the tone.

    I was trying to say that I no longer think Ferron&#39;s illustration is accurate.  I think you and I have a different interpretation of what I mean by "bouncing".  But it is not worthy of debate.

Well, the whole point is that they do not bounce off the interior walls, and you will see that if you read the paper. There is a jet which is modulated by the reed that travels down the reed channel attached to the walls (as close as anything comes to "bouncing"), but which very quicky detaches
 itself and is dissipated in turbulence vortices. It is that dissipation that allows the pressure pulses to excite the air column without disturbing the standing compression wave that is set up. This is very similar to what happens in a flute air jet, except that the pulsing is controlled by an
 air reed rather than a cane reed.
  
 Ferron talks about it being "reasonable to assume..." based on his moving bar model, but as Lance points out, it is not reasonable to assume what he assumes at all, as a moving bar transmits its waves into ambient pressure with no pressure differential across it. I don&#39;t know why you insist on
 believing the Ferron fairy tale. It is totally disproved by the real science.

Thanks. Another paper for my to-do list. 

I think the flow puffing creates waves of acoustic pressure that bounce off the interior walls. That is what molecules do. But pressure vectors originating from the reed surface is not an accurate representation. If that is what Ferron is trying to show. He did not really say.
