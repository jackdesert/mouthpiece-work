I disagree.  It is perhaps difficult for some to learn.  It requires 
good hand skills, a machinist&#39;s eye and mind, AND enough playing skill 
to know how the work affects the player.

But it can be learned.

            <pre class='message__body'>Many players and refacers will advise against working on your own #1 mouthpiece because refacing is hard to learn.  This is a warning for person who is thinking about working on their mouthpiece without going through the steps needed to learn the craft.  
 
If you do not practice working on some blanks and junk mouthpieces first, your risk goes way up that you will do damage instead of good.

            <pre class='message__body'>Between watching a guy do facing work one time and what I have learned here, I have been able to salvage several mouthpieces from the trash bin a tweak others to play better.  I wish I had more data about facing curves, though.  I have relatively good info on Link tenor facings, courtesy of this group, but for anything else I pretty much have to copy existing mouthpieces in my collection.
 
One of my biggest successes was for a guy who had developed a habit of using a pocket knife to pull his reed up from the facing of his Lakey tenor piece.  He had made HUGE gouges in the rails.  I ground down the table and started from there to completely re-do the facing.  He was apparently satisfied, since he is still using the mouthpiece!
 
Didn&#39;t I buy my facing glass and feeler guages from you?

            <pre class='message__body'>Based on other skills I have learned, I would say that it is about as 
difficult as learning to sharpen a chainsaw.  I&#39;m not sure how much 
that helps, but I think that it&#39;s accurate.  Little improvements are 
easy.  Perfection is subjective and therefore probably impossible.

            <pre class='message__body'>I figured I was on pretty safe ground, since the piece was SO trashed I could not help but improve it.  The owner told me that if he didn&#39;t like it I could keep it, but he took it.  I have also brought an Otto Link metal tenor mouthpiece from a state where I referred to it as "the doorstop" (as in gold-plated brass doorstop) to where it is currently my number 2 mouthpiece and, with a little more work in the baffle area, it might move up.
