I disagree.  It is perhaps difficult for some to learn.  It requires 
good hand skills, a machinist&#39;s eye and mind, AND enough playing skill 
to know how the work affects the player.

But it can be learned.

            <pre class='message__body'>Between watching a guy do facing work one time and what I have learned here, I have been able to salvage several mouthpieces from the trash bin a tweak others to play better.  I wish I had more data about facing curves, though.  I have relatively good info on Link tenor facings, courtesy of this group, but for anything else I pretty much have to copy existing mouthpieces in my collection.
 
One of my biggest successes was for a guy who had developed a habit of using a pocket knife to pull his reed up from the facing of his Lakey tenor piece.  He had made HUGE gouges in the rails.  I ground down the table and started from there to completely re-do the facing.  He was apparently satisfied, since he is still using the mouthpiece!
 
Didn&#39;t I buy my facing glass and feeler guages from you?

difficult as learning to sharpen a chainsaw.  I&#39;m not sure how much

been selling refacing tools sense 2006.I have 146 pos feedback from 
buyers on ebay most from beginners.I just want to make sure that my 
claim that refacing is rewarding work that anyone can learn is true.In 
all that time I only had one buyer who said it was to hard and wanted a 
refund.I had no problem giving him a refund.I have never told people to 
reface for other people that should be left to the pros.I just think 
that when a person refaces his own mouthpiece and get it to play better 
that is a great feeling.Yes you will kill some mouthpieces when you 
start.But in the end if you stick to it you can become pretty good at 
it. Jim

            <pre class='message__body'>I figured I was on pretty safe ground, since the piece was SO trashed I could not help but improve it.  The owner told me that if he didn&#39;t like it I could keep it, but he took it.  I have also brought an Otto Link metal tenor mouthpiece from a state where I referred to it as "the doorstop" (as in gold-plated brass doorstop) to where it is currently my number 2 mouthpiece and, with a little more work in the baffle area, it might move up.

>I think you did Bill Thanks.The point I&#39;m trying to make is I have 
been selling refacing tools sense 2006.I have 146 pos feedback from 
buyers on ebay most from beginners.I just want to make sure that my 
claim that refacing is rewarding work that anyone can learn is true.In 
all that time I only had one buyer who said it was to hard and wanted a 
refund.I had no problem giving him a refund.I have never told people to 
reface for other people that should be left to the pros.I just think 
that when a person refaces his own mouthpiece and get it to play better 
that is a great feeling.Yes you will kill some mouthpieces when you 
start.But in the end if you stick to it you can become pretty good at 
it. Jim
