Scenario:
    Imagine I&#39;ve designed and built a nice mouthpiece holder 
presicely rocking the MP over a sandpaper, letting intermediate 
chamber works, measuring the curve / tip opening and blowing in it 
without MP repositioning in the holder. Some bent PVC  tube with a 
second octave opening  is attachable via quick coupling to get some 
idea how does it sounds. A thumb finger holds a reed during the &#39;play 
test&#39;. If you wish a flat, you get it precisely where you want it and 
you control how wide it is.
   I am sending a couple equally finished MP to Mojo Bary for the 
examination he kindly test them and approves. At this point I&#39;ve 
spent 500 bucks on a model.
   Being excited I&#39;m buying a TIG welder able to weld aluminum (2 
grands), order CNC machined parts and buy materials to build 5 units 
accordingly to amount of this group members willing to try &#39;demo&#39; 
version. I spend 1 day on making each fixture.
All 5 Volunteeres did not returned the fixtures and I made 200$ 
during that week.
    Being even more excited I am filling Patent applications, (US-
provisional- 300$?, plus international ones &#39;PTC&#39; and &#39;WO&#39;, all 
without a lawyer, let say 3000$ each). 
   After that I realise that there are 40 people worldwide intersted 
in this thing and I cancel patenting and may be say buy to my 
mortgage.
   After all some company makes the fixture in China, bad quality, 
looks good, 50 bucks, sells through music shops and e-bay. People buy 
to have, not to use.
    
    I would glad to get a mature comment regarding this scenario. 

Thanks for reading.
Dmitri
