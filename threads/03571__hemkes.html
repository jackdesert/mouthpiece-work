I&#39;m not sure if this question was meant for me or not -

I tried Hemkes once several years ago and didn&#39;t like them. For me the tips 
seemd to be cut too thin and the hearts too thick giving me a reed that was 
tubby (down low) and squeeky (up high) at the same time. It seemed to me 
this was a reed to be played "tactfully" by a classical player on a 
mouthpiece with a relatively close tip opening.
FWIW, I haven&#39;t had any luck with the Alexanders either which a lot of guys 
love.

So, as always YMMV,

Keith

Like a &#39;good&#39; Rico.  Easy playing, but nothing unusual, except they

That&#39;s remarkable.  I remember they seemed a little wider than some

S-80 E.

I only switched away from them in favor of Legere synthetics. More 
playing; less fiddling around.

I have been searching for a new brand of tenor reed,
and found the Vandoren ZZ&#39;s to be really good.
