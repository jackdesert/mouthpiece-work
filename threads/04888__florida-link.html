            <pre class='message__body'>It is my understanding that this is the primary performance 
difference between the newer STMs and the old ones (e.g. Floridas). I 
have several Floridas, but I also have a modern STM (about 10 years 
old, that Theo Wanne took the table down by hand and refaced. They 
play very similarly. He also adjusted the table angel (with respect 
to the bore) to match the old Floridas. He was convinced that this is 
the &#39;magic&#39; of the Floridas.
