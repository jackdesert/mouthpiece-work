            <pre class='message__body'>I have been following with interest the long discussions on acoustical theory regarding mouthpieces, the "missing cone", "Frs" and other exotic critters.  I offer the following observations:

1) The participants all SEEM to have an axe to grind.  I make that conclusion from the often aggressive, inflammatory and personal remarks contained in many posts.

2) The discussions seem to veer off into arguments over minutiae. I think this is a side effect of the previous observation, as the participants joust for points.

3) Very little posting happens about "mouthpiece work", such as "varying the angle of the baffle at the tip rail affects the harmonic spectrum of the test mouthpiece by increasing or decreasing the 4th through 7th harmonics".  (Completely made up statement, btw, but in my limited experience likely to have some truth in it.)

Speaking as an ex-professional saxophonist, now IT professional who still knows what to do with a tenor, and an amateur mouthpiece refacer, I wish that everyone in this discussion would:

1) Get over yourselves.  

2) Do some analysis and experimentation that will actually a) help the rest of us in our mouthpiece work; or, b) help the rest of us make some money by being better refacers or manufacturers; or c) both of the above.

Keith B., I applaud your patience in allowing this discussion to continue. I assume you do so because you hope, as do I, that there will be some nugget of information that might guide us in our quest for better mouthpiece design.  So far, the participants can&#39;t even define their terms the same way.  

For example, I still don&#39;t know what Frs is, with regard to saxophones, and I&#39;ve read FMA and skimmed some of the papers mentioned in this discussion. It&#39;s pretty clear that it means the "natural frequency of the reed on the staple" of an oboe reed plus staple played by itself, but since it&#39;s possible to vary that pitch with a good, clear tone by at least a musical 5th or so (I used to play a little oboe - we called it playing the "show-bo"...), I don&#39;t know what use it is, or if it can tell me if the reed I&#39;m working on will work well on my oboe, or what.  Ditto for the sax mouthpiece, except that most folks can play an octave on the mouthpiece by itself.  

Maybe if Lance, John and Toby can tell us what they are trying to accomplish by their studies I would understand.  (I think I know what Steve G. wants to accomplish - no offense intended, BTW, I am a great admirer of Mr. Goodson.) And I DO appreciate the concept of knowledge for its own sake, but if we could just get an idea of why these guys are fighting over the resonant frequency of an alto neck and how they expect that to improve the world of saxophone, it would be nice.

In other words, what&#39;s the point?  I&#39;m not being sarcastic, I really want to know.  I sincerely hope that the point is not, as has been implied by some, merely self-aggrandizement.

I&#39;ll shut up now.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Theory and Practice and Money

 

  

I have been following with interest the long discussions on acoustical
theory regarding mouthpieces, the "missing cone", "Frs" and other exotic
critters. I offer the following observations:

1) The participants all SEEM to have an axe to grind. I make that conclusion
from the often aggressive, inflammatory and personal remarks contained in
many posts.

2) The discussions seem to veer off into arguments over minutiae. I think
this is a side effect of the previous observation, as the participants joust
for points.

3) Very little posting happens about "mouthpiece work", such as "varying the
angle of the baffle at the tip rail affects the harmonic spectrum of the
test mouthpiece by increasing or decreasing the 4th through 7th harmonics".
(Completely made up statement, btw, but in my limited experience likely to
have some truth in it.)

Speaking as an ex-professional saxophonist, now IT professional who still
knows what to do with a tenor, and an amateur mouthpiece refacer, I wish
that everyone in this discussion would:

1) Get over yourselves. 

2) Do some analysis and experimentation that will actually a) help the rest
of us in our mouthpiece work; or, b) help the rest of us make some money by
being better refacers or manufacturers; or c) both of the above.

Keith B., I applaud your patience in allowing this discussion to continue. I
assume you do so because you hope, as do I, that there will be some nugget
of information that might guide us in our quest for better mouthpiece
design. So far, the participants can&#39;t even define their terms the same way.


For example, I still don&#39;t know what Frs is, with regard to saxophones, and
I&#39;ve read FMA and skimmed some of the papers mentioned in this discussion.
It&#39;s pretty clear that it means the "natural frequency of the reed on the

It is probably time that some other members speak up about the bickering,
pettiness and acrimony that has been associated with these acoustical theory

Thank you.  This has been my hope.  If there is no discussion, we can learn anything.  We censor the flow of information.  However, as you have illustrated, there is a lot of "flow" with little information we can use.  If something comes along that is useful, I think most of us might not notice since we have gotten used to filtering out the bickering.  I think you guys can do a much better job of discussing accoustic topics in a professional manner.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thank you Steve for your candor.  I will be happy to address what the
point is from my perspective, but first a comment about your use of the
term self-aggrandizement.

Self-aggrandizement is defined as:  The act or practice of enhancing or
exaggerating one&#39;s own importance, power, or reputation.   Synonyms of
self-aggrandizing  include:   crowing, boasting, bragging,
self-promotion, self-importance, self-glorification, self-flattery, on
an ego trip.

I&#39;m sure that one could find a better example of this than Lance, Toby,
or myself on this forum.  With all due respect I really think you chose
the wrong term. Calling what we sometimes do an anal retentive, ego
driven, pseudo scientific, neener neener I know more than you, pissing
contest would be a far more accurate description.  The fact is that we
are all learning a tremendous amount of information about how this all
works, and trust me there will come a time when it comes together and
there will be some conclusions that we can all benefit from---kind of
like making sausage.

Here&#39;s the point.

Most of the literature on woodwind acoustics discusses a "missing cone"
at the end of a saxophone.

From Benade we know that two requirements must be met for the saxophone
to work properly.

1.  The "effective" volume of the mouthpiece must closely match the
volume of the missing cone.

2.  The frequency (pitch) played by the mouthpiece + neck (Frs) must be
the same as the calculated frequency
       of the missing cone + neck.

Here&#39;s the challenge.

- Except for Ferron&#39;s Saxophone is My Voice there is no mention in the
literature of how to actually find the volume of the missing cone or
it&#39;s length.

-There is nowhere in the literature that includes studies of matching
mouthpiece "effective" volume to that of a missing cone.

-There is nowhere in the literature that includes measurements of the
Frs of various saxophone necks with various mouthpieces.

-There is only a brief mention in Benade&#39;s text of how to determine the
"effective" volume of a mouthpiece, which very basically means the
volume added by the vibration of the reed and the player&#39;s mouth to the
geometric volume inside the mouthpiece.

Here is whyI believe this information is important

-It is common knowledge that some modern mouthpieces with a long narrow
shank play out of tune on older instruments.  Measuring and testing
Benade&#39;s requirements with different mouthpieces on the necks of these
instruments can offer solutions, or better still provide a scientific
description for why a solution found by trial and error works.

-Knowing that the chamber and shank each have a very different role in
the interior geometry of a mouthpiece,  having a clear understanding of
the overall volume required by that particular mouthpiece can help the
mouthpiece maker/refacer to balance those volumes without changing the
intonation characteristics of the mouthpiece.

-Some problems players experience with mouthpieces are "pilot error" and
not a fault of the equipment.  A clear understanding of mouthpiece pitch
and its role in meeting Benade&#39;s requirements can go a long way to
helping customers/students overcome these types of problems.

-Some mouthpieces produce a "warble" on some models of saxophones.  The
typical approach is to blindly do trial and error until the problem goes
away.  The key to understanding the cause of the warble and therefore
its solution, I believe lies in better understanding the mouthpiece
substitution for the missing cone.

-There are dozens of other ideas, but this should get the point across.
Let me know if you have any further questions.

for its own sake, but if we could just get an idea of why these guys are
fighting over the resonant frequency of an alto neck and how they expect
that to improve the world of saxophone, it would be nice.

In other words, what&#39;s the point?  I&#39;m not being sarcastic, I really
want to know.  I sincerely hope that the point is not, as has been
implied by some, merely self-aggrandizement.  I&#39;ll shut up now.

I ground my axes a long time ago. I&#39;m only here to try to keep the discussion grounded on the acoustic facts as I understand them.

Personally, I think this discussion lost the forest for the trees a long time ago, particularly a couple of big trees. They are important, but they are hardly the forest. Personally I agree with Steve. If it were me I would suggest that it is well past time to start doing some experiments, and see if an how they jibe with the theory, instead of trying to figure out the internal volume to a microliter, the Frs to within a Hz or how a bend in the neck changes the sounding frequency. IMO there are too many other factors influencing intonation to get so focused on these parameters. We are well into territory that goes beyond where the science has definitive numbers, and--sorry to say it--speculating in minute detail about things of which we have no real understanding. It takes Scavone about 70 pages laden with extremely complex math to even approach a realistic model of what goes on in the sax. I&#39;m tired of debating how many angels can dance on the head of the proverbial pin. 

I&#39;m not against masturbation, but it is not as satisfying as sex in my experience. That being said, I personally don&#39;t mind the discussion continuing. I get so many spam messages every day, a couple more about missing cones don&#39;t really bother me, and I would ask those who have such negative feelings about them to consider why they cause such emotion. Aren&#39;t they easy to delete?

Still and all, I am perfectly happy to follow Steve&#39;s suggestion and move the discussion to the acoustics group, as long as everybody can participate who wishes to, but I really don&#39;t see that as a problem. In a worst case, it can always be moved back here, Keith willing. John, Lance, what do you think?

  I have been following with interest the long discussions on acoustical theory regarding mouthpieces, the "missing cone", "Frs" and other exotic critters. I offer the following observations:

  1) The participants all SEEM to have an axe to grind. I make that conclusion from the often aggressive, inflammatory and personal remarks contained in many posts.

  2) The discussions seem to veer off into arguments over minutiae. I think this is a side effect of the previous observation, as the participants joust for points.

  3) Very little posting happens about "mouthpiece work", such as "varying the angle of the baffle at the tip rail affects the harmonic spectrum of the test mouthpiece by increasing or decreasing the 4th through 7th harmonics". (Completely made up statement, btw, but in my limited experience likely to have some truth in it.)

  Speaking as an ex-professional saxophonist, now IT professional who still knows what to do with a tenor, and an amateur mouthpiece refacer, I wish that everyone in this discussion would:

  1) Get over yourselves. 

  2) Do some analysis and experimentation that will actually a) help the rest of us in our mouthpiece work; or, b) help the rest of us make some money by being better refacers or manufacturers; or c) both of the above.

  Keith B., I applaud your patience in allowing this discussion to continue. I assume you do so because you hope, as do I, that there will be some nugget of information that might guide us in our quest for better mouthpiece design. So far, the participants can&#39;t even define their terms the same way. 

  For example, I still don&#39;t know what Frs is, with regard to saxophones, and I&#39;ve read FMA and skimmed some of the papers mentioned in this discussion. It&#39;s pretty clear that it means the "natural frequency of the reed on the staple" of an oboe reed plus staple played by itself, but since it&#39;s possible to vary that pitch with a good, clear tone by at least a musical 5th or so (I used to play a little oboe - we called it playing the "show-bo"...), I don&#39;t know what use it is, or if it can tell me if the reed I&#39;m working on will work well on my oboe, or what. Ditto for the sax mouthpiece, except that most folks can play an octave on the mouthpiece by itself. 

  Maybe if Lance, John and Toby can tell us what they are trying to accomplish by their studies I would understand. (I think I know what Steve G. wants to accomplish - no offense intended, BTW, I am a great admirer of Mr. Goodson.) And I DO appreciate the concept of knowledge for its own sake, but if we could just get an idea of why these guys are fighting over the resonant frequency of an alto neck and how they expect that to improve the world of saxophone, it would be nice.

  In other words, what&#39;s the point? I&#39;m not being sarcastic, I really want to know. I sincerely hope that the point is not, as has been implied by some, merely self-aggrandizement.

  I&#39;ll shut up now.

(Completely made up statement, btw, but in my limited experience likely to
have some truth in it.)

Speaking as an ex-professional saxophonist, now IT professional who still
knows what to do with a tenor, and an amateur mouthpiece refacer, I wish
that everyone in this discussion would:

1) Get over yourselves. 

2) Do some analysis and experimentation that will actually a) help the rest
of us in our mouthpiece work; or, b) help the rest of us make some money by
being better refacers or manufacturers; or c) both of the above.

Keith B., I applaud your patience in allowing this discussion to continue. I
assume you do so because you hope, as do I, that there will be some nugget
of information that might guide us in our quest for better mouthpiece
design. So far, the participants can&#39;t even define their terms the same way.


For example, I still don&#39;t know what Frs is, with regard to saxophones, and
I&#39;ve read FMA and skimmed some of the papers mentioned in this discussion.
It&#39;s pretty clear that it means the "natural frequency of the reed on the
staple" of an oboe reed plus staple played by itself, but since it&#39;s
possible to vary that pitch with a good, clear tone by at least a musical
5th or so (I used to play a little oboe - we called it playing the
"show-bo"...), I don&#39;t know what use it is, or if it can tell me if the reed
I&#39;m working on will work well on my oboe, or what. Ditto for the sax
mouthpiece, except that most folks can play an octave on the mouthpiece by
itself. 

Maybe if Lance, John and Toby can tell us what they are trying to accomplish
by their studies I would understand. (I think I know what Steve G. wants to
accomplish - no offense intended, BTW, I am a great admirer of Mr. Goodson.)
And I DO appreciate the concept of knowledge for its own sake, but if we
could just get an idea of why these guys are fighting over the resonant
frequency of an alto neck and how they expect that to improve the world of
saxophone, it would be nice.

In other words, what&#39;s the point? I&#39;m not being sarcastic, I really want to
know. I sincerely hope that the point is not, as has been implied by some,
merely self-aggrandizement.

I&#39;ll shut up now.

I know that I have done this a number of times, the last of which, was a clear response to Steve G, just a couple of days ago........

"They seem to deteriorate in a personal matter rather than an academic 
one."

I can only speak for myself regarding what appears to be bickering and nit-picking.  It is not a personal matter.  It is a matter of principle and the logic upon which the results being discussed are derived.  Quick example:  

I had a conversation the other day with my buddy John, on neck design.  John emphatically held that his SBA alto neck was designed specifically for his horn body. I accept that as true.  Examining John&#39;s Missing Cone Volume Study however, reveals a troubling (for me) contradiction.  If the the neck air column is indeed designed for the body, then when attached to the body, everything air column North of the body to the small end of the neck, is neck, which would include the neck tube, tenon, and the 1mm section of air column between the body and the tenon.  

John maintains however, that, while the cylindrical tenon air column is part of the neck, the cylindrical gap air column is not.  That leaves us with.....either Selmer found out they made the body 1mm too short and too narrow, and added the short and wider cylindrical section on afterward as a body extension, or the body is OK, and Selmer&#39;s design includes a revolutionary new and separate 1mm cylindrical section between the body and the neck.

Obviously, the tenon is just too short, and that is common.  If you believe that the tenon is part of the neck air column, then so too is that of the gap and it&#39;s length, volume, and diameter must be included in all analysis.  You can&#39;t just toss it out.  Frankly, I have a different view of where the tenon belongs, but it is this type of faulty logic which permeates John&#39;s method and his arguments which I find disturbing.  Enough of that.  

I have a different view on neck tenons.  In my forthcoming analysis, the tenon is considered part of the body.  The neck has no cylindrical section.  It ends where the physical bent neck tube ends, in the tenon ring.   All the horns I&#39;m examining have one of my conical tenons installed, the same length as the original cylindrical tenon.  I found, at least on the horns I have here,  that matching the body tube diameter and continuing the body taper, results in the top end of the tenon matching the neck tube in diameter, to within .05 mm.

All this relates directly to mouthpieces in the end.

"They lack any conclusive useful advice that is the purpose of the

What one person might find extremely useful, another might find no use for at all.  Some want to be told what to do with clear, numbered directions.  Some like food for thought.

            <pre class='message__body'>...or close enough.  Here is a gem from Ralph Morgan via Sax Journal that is food for thought.  I have most of Ralph&#39;s columns, but when I asked SJ a few years ago if I could post scans of them on the Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site, they would not give permission.  I&#39;m sending this one out anyhow.  I&#39;ll deleted after a while.

I did not agree with a lot of Ralph&#39;s writings.  But he did "put it out there" (though lacking some details) and was a master craftsman.   Enjoy this column from July/Aug 1990.

            <pre class='message__body'>As many of you know, I write a column about saxophone design for every issue
of The Saxophone Journal and have done so for some time. As far as I know,
ALL prior issues are available, going back for MANY years. There is a great
deal of very useful information which is somewhat timeless in character in
these back issues. They are available from the publisher, Dorn Publications.

[Attachment(s) from Keith Bradbury included below] 

...or close enough.  Here is a gem from Ralph Morgan via Sax Journal that is
food for thought.  I have most of Ralph&#39;s columns, but when I asked SJ a few
years ago if I could post scans of them on the Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site,
they would not give permission.  I&#39;m sending this one out anyhow.  I&#39;ll
deleted after a while.

 

I did not agree with a lot of Ralph&#39;s writings.  But he did "put it out
there" (though lacking some details) and was a master craftsman.   Enjoy
this column from July/Aug 1990.

putting up paper after paper about on my acoustics website for review
and comment?   What would that other agenda be if it is not discussing

The fact of the matter is that I know far too well how your other forums
been run in the past to be comfortable participating on one now.  If
anyone would like to know the backstory on this I would be happy to
answer a personal email, since this forum is not a proper setting to air
dirty laundry.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith that was an interesting reading.  Ralph Morgan certainly
understood that the mouthpiece design must match the geometry of the
saxophone and the neck.

He does however refer to the length of the saxophone from the tip of the
mouthpiece to the bell as the length that the scale is based upon.  With
the work of Benade and others we now know that the length that
determines the wavelengths and therefore the frequencies of the notes
begins at the apex of the missing cone which is well beyond the tip of
the mouthpiece.

This is illustrated in the scale drawing at this link:  Calculating
missing cone frequency.

This is why I feel that discussions of the missing cone volume,
mouthpiece equivalent volume, and frequency of the mouthpiece and neck

the central concept of this forum which is to find ways to make a

My response to the critics would be to go to the bottom of the homepage

I would agree with that......except for the entire neck being necessary to get an accurate frs.  LOL.  If you understand the acoustics, and it&#39;s not that difficult, then it is obvious. One might not need the information in order to make a nice facing or to figure out how to make and attach a new bite plate, but it is essential for anything having to do with chamber design and tuning.

Perhaps a list of recommended reading would help those inclined to be interested in the subject, but still have difficulty understanding how it applies.

            <pre class='message__body'>First of all I strongly disagree that a discussion of the process of
measuring and comparing the effective volume of a mouthpiece with that
of the missing cone it is a substitution for is off topic for this
forum.  I will not repeat my reasons articulated in another post.

There have been 1040 posts to date since January 1, 2010.   That
represents a 615.4% increase over the first 3 months of the previous
year which had only 169 total posts and the month isn&#39;t even over.

Of those 1040 posts:

-143 have been by Toby 13.8%
-135 have been by John  13%
-131 have been by Lance 12.6%

Total  409 posts  39.3%

If we removed all of these 409 posts accused of being "off topic" there
would still be 631 posts remaining
426 more than last year.

Steve G had 132 posts in that same given time.  Categorizing those posts
by their main content one finds the following:

- 45 posts were to complain about and argue with the acoustics
discussion  34%
- 43 posts were clearly intended to hype and market his products, boast
of his accomplishments, or to name drop  33%
- 12 posts were off topic in other ways ---NAMM, discussing reeds,
necks, straight bari, parabolic bores etc.  9%
- 32 posts were actually on the "pure topic" (by his definition) of
mouthpiece refacing and the tools required  24%

So by his own definition, 76% of his own posts were "off topic" in that
period of time.

Summary
The statement below is patently false.  People who live in glass houses
shouldn&#39;t throw stones.

I&#39;m sorry Steve and John, you both ignored me on this. I have set your
membership status (back) to "moderated" to halt these types of posts here. I
will need to review each post you make before it is sent to the group. There
will be a time delay. I will change the status back when I see you can
interact with out bringing up these issues.
