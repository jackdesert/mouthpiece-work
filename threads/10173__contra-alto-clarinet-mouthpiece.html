            <pre class='message__body'>Where do I go looking for a very wide tip opening fairly long lay contra
alto clarinet mouthpiece.  I am playing on #4 reeds and would like to go
to more mouthpiece and less hard reed.  I play very open saxophone
mouthpieces including bari and bass.  The Web was not much help on the
topic.

Thanks,

Bill

            <pre class='message__body'>You will have to have one made. Tom Ridenour once told me that a long lay
really helped the contra mouthpiece and the one he sent me was a little more
open than usual too.
