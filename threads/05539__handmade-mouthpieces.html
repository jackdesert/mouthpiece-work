            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

          What&#39;s up all you mouthpiece guys out there.  I&#39;ve finally came up with a great blueprint for my mouthpieces.   I&#39;ve been making handmade mouthpieces for about 5 years now.  I am a college student at Jacksonville state university, in Jacksonville, AL.  I was just wondering what&#39;s the best way to get people to discover your work.  I thought about putting up a website, or just visting, and setting up at a NAMM show.  If you guys have any helpful suggestions just let me know.
           Anyway back to the mouthpieces.  Like I said, I started making these about 5 years ago.  I would make them out of a cheap wood called bomar that I purchased from lowe&#39;s.  I later read my way through a course in machinery, and began to experiment with metal.  I make my mouthpieces out of solid brass round bar.  I cut the facing with a cutter I designed, and had made for me.  I will eventually put some pictures on the forum.  Please guys tell me what you think. Yes, I do understand that pictures don&#39;t mean anything, but I&#39;m pretty happy with the results I&#39;ve been recieving ( As far as playability goes).  Hope to here from you guys soon.  There&#39;s only a handful of us left, so let&#39;s not loose this beautiful artform.  Koodos to mojo for starting this forum.
