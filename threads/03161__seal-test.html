I can see the test is valid to determine if the reed has warped .  I 
have used this test many times but I don&#39;t think it means much to
test 
the facing of the mouthpiece.  I think pretty well any mouthpiece
will 
succeed in the seal test.  Perhaps the tip opening and reed strength 
will alter the length of time it stays shut.   JP
