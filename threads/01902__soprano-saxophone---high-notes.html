I have a soprano mp that is stubborn on the high notes F , F# - The

            <pre class='message__body'>Peter, sometimes it is the mouthpiece/reed, sometimes the player, 
sometimes a combination of both.  The Mk VI sopranos are stuffy up high, 
and at best, the high notes were difficult.

A mouthpiece setup that gives a very dark tone is more difficult to play 
up high.  You need something with a moderate baffle for the high notes.  
There are plenty of good mouthpieces out there.

Many who try the Runyon Custom for the first time report ease of high 
register.  One guy said, now I need palm key risers.  I never bothered 
before, in 20 years I have not been able to play above D.  This was a 
guy who was a fine alto/tenor/bari/clarinet/flute player.  With the 
Custom he was able to play up there instantly.  All of the Runyon 
soprano models play up high well.  Also the Jody Jazz.  I just got a 
Jody Jazz ESP soprano that is simply outstanding.

BTW, I play daily up to A3... as in high F, F#, G, G#, A.  You have to 
play high G&#39;s and A&#39;s for Percy Grainger&#39;s Shepherd&#39;s Hey (Paul Cohen&#39;s 
arr for sax quartet), for example.

Now, the player... for alto sax, high fork E and fork F, F#, all require 
a slight alteration of the oral cavity.  No, not the throat...  the 
MOUTH.  OK, let me explain how to do this. 

This is so easy... you can whistle, right?  OK, whistle a scale.  Do it 
again, but this time, pay attention to what moves when you whistle and 
change pitch.  Did you make the lips tighter?  No.  Did you alter the 
throat, opening or closing?  No, that is really difficult, and I don&#39;t 
know where that idea came from. 

It is the TONGUE that moves.  Feel what you are doing, you are raising 
the lowering the tongue, from an ahhh position to an ehhh postion to an 
eeee position.   Arching the tongure up in the middle.  This reduces the 
volume between the tongue and roof of the mouth, thereby speeding up the 
airstream, and focusing it toward the reed.  This is the trick for high 
notes, NOT tightening the embouchure.  That is detrimental.  There may 
be a tiny increase in pressure, but that is very slight.  It is the 
tongue position that really does the trick.

For alto you must do this for high fork E, F, and F#.

But for soprano, this same alteration of oral cavity must begin about 
high A or B (which is E-F# on alto!), and by the time you get to C 
(which would be a G on the alto), it is nearly an eeee tongue position.

I find reeds that have a medium to bright cut work better for high 
notes, too.  Rico, Plasticover, Lavoz, Java, Fibracell, and others.  The 
very heavy cuts, like Vandoren blue box, are more difficult.  Going to a 
very hard reed is not helpful either.  Very hard does not fibrate up 
high, and too soft closes up and chokes off.  Like Goldilocks porridge, 
it has to be just right.

Well, hope this all helps.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: soprano saxophone - high notes</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>Now, specifically about the mouthpiece...

The baffle needs to be just right.  By baffle, I am not talking the 
entire roof of the chamber, just the first 1/8" or so on a soprano 
mouthpiece.  Too high (close to the reed), and the mouthpiece will be 
excessively bright, and spit will tend to collect between the reed and 
baffle and give an irritating sizzle.

If the baffle is too low, or concave, that is, there is a straight line 
from the inside edge of the tip rail on back to the roof of the 
mouthpiece, no "rollover" at all, the mouthpiece will tend to play 
"stuffy" or resistant. The tone will be quite dark.  High notes will be 
difficult.  Projection will be nil.  Examples of this are the Caravan 
and Rascher mouthpieces.  Guys want a dark tone, buy these, then 
complain that their solo passages in concert band are covered up by the 
flute player.  Go figure.

Too small tip opening is another problem for high notes.  To keep the 
reed from choking off, blowing shut, a very hard reed must be used.  See 
my comments on the Rascher/Caravan mouthpieces.

The throat, where the chamber enters the bore, should have some focus to 
it, not too large.  In this respect, the very old Selmer Soloist 
sopranos, and the Selmer Paris metals and LT&#39;s have a good shape there.  
Their problem is the small tip opening... C*.  Who decided on THAT tip 
opening???  Also, the baffle is too low to be a good classical piece.  
The player fights a bright edgy tone, trying to get a dark tone with a 
high baffle.  The mouthpiece sizzles from spit collecting there.  You 
cannot see where the tip rail ends and the baffle begins.  Wet the reed 
and depress it with your finger, and you see it is touching the baffle 
for about 1/4" from the tip!  Well, that is too "high" a baffle.  A few 
minutes with the file will fix that.

So, the baffle has to be just right. 

A very wide mouthpiece with concave sidewalls can also give a spread, 
unfocused tone, and be difficult to play up high.

And with all this, some guy will come along with such a mouthpiece, with 
what appears to be all bad features, and it will play great.  But what I 
describe above is what I have observed in working on mouthpieces for 
many years.

            <pre class='message__body'>Paul got me a Runyon Quantum sop mpc that does very well in the palms of my old Conn sop, which is truly a bitch up high. I tried a bunch of different mpcs before, and most were a lost cause up there with this horn. I had played for years on a vintage Berg Larsen which does pretty well, but the Runyon is a bit more free-blowing with a bit more body and just as good at the top in response. Be warned however that some horns are just much harder to play in the palms, and the mpc cannot completely solve the problem.
