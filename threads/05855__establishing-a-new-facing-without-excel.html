            <pre class='message__body'>Of course the "classic" refacers did not have Excel.  Most of them have
their secret notebook of facing curves based on measurements from
mouthpieces they liked or their clients liked.  Many, if not most, still
practice the craft this way today.

I suppose a few clever ones could carry out calculations long hand and/or
tried to use large sheets of graph paper for analysis.  But the power of
using a spreadsheet, like Excel, is a powerful tool available to all.  I
use it before and during my refacing work.  It is also my database of
records.  You can find MS Office 2003 Student Edition (w/Excel) for under
$100 on ebay.  

However, just buying the tool alone will not help.  There is a learning
curve.  If you do not already know the basics of Excel from using it on
other applications, you will find it difficult to understand and manipulate
the spreadsheets shared on the MP Work Yahoo site.  

I think it is beyond the scope of this group to try and teach Excel to
non-users.  But if someone wants to try, I&#39;m OK with it.

obtaining a software program. If I was on a desert island with a flat 
pce of glass, some sandpaper and an assortment of files, glass guage 
and feeler gauges, graph paper, a mpce that doesn&#39;t play, and a sax 
how would I be on the right track to getting the optimum playability 
out of this mpce? (Taking into consideration evening the rails, a 
flat table,and a consistent well shaped tip and not taking any 
inside work as baffle,etc., into consideration.) After plotting a 
very uneven facing and establishing the opening that I find 
comfortable to play, leaving the facing length alone, would I try and 
draw an even radial curve on my graph paper, and if drawn to scale,do 
the appropriate sanding and measuring to meet these points? Again, I 
do not know that this mpce was not worked on and that any of the 
original parameters or characteristics of this mpce are intact. 
Also knowing that I changed the tip opening to a more open tip, what 
would be the radius that I would use to create this new profile of 
facing? A radius of 4.5, 5.0 etc?? How would you decide which radius 
is the best besides play testing? or is this the only way to get to 
my ideal mpce?
Thanks for the responses so far but I think the above is more what I 
wanted to ask. I&#39;d like to understand this process more b4 I rely on 
a program to get me there.

            <pre class='message__body'>You may not be able to get to an "optimum" facing curve in this scenario.

The Files area has a basic sequence of steps you can follow.  The hard part
will be improving the facing curve without a set of targets.

You can make improvements by first making the facing even left to right. 
Then try to identify bumps (short radius curves) and kinks in the curve.   
You may be able to tell with measurements and/or by observing how light
reflects off the rails.  Blend these out to a flatter curve.

Also, look for flat sections.  These need to be more curved. However this
is a lot of work since now you need to leave the flat spots alone while
bringing down the rest of the curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------If you're asking how to do the math by hand, it can be done, but if you're
asking how to establish refacing targets without the math - refacers have
traditionally worked that way, but I imagine they established sets of target
numbers through extensive trial and error.  
  
As far as the math goes, the radius itself is not very important, but you need
to find a curve that is a segment of a circle, with the flat table of the
mouthpiece tangent to it. Any given tip opening and facing length will yield
only one such curve - the spreadsheet calculates the feeler gauge readings
you'd need to execute that curve. It also converts mm (used to measure length)
and inches (generally used to measure tip openings) to make it all line up
right.

exactly what I&#39;m looking for. Relative to refacing a mpce that needs 
refacing, meaning that it looks like there was some work done to it and 
it definitely does not play well the way it is. How do you select the 
proper radial curvature of the facing? 
I don&#39;t have access to the Excel program I&#39;ve read about that plots for 
you the ideal curvature nor do I have access to a list of plotted 
readings of my particular mpce. I would not know the radius of an ideal 
curvature for this mpce either. Is it a logical approach to render the 
most smoothest curve relative to the plotted readings taken - given 
that the readings taken of the this mpce are up and down and not even, 
also that the tip opening will be opened slightly (maybe 5-8 thou&#39;s). 
How do you judge what is the best arc of the facing given this 
situation? Or is there a list of radial curves for particular mpces 
available that are considered ideal. I would be dealing with Alto,tenor 
and bari pces. If this particular issue has been discussed in a way 
that a novice could understand it please refer me to the particular # 
of the discussions. Any insight to this query would be greatly 
appreciated.

The Files area has a basic sequence of steps you can follow. The hard part
will be improving the facing curve without a set of targets.

You can make improvements by first making the facing even left to right. 
Then try to identify bumps (short radius curves) and kinks in the curve. 
You may be able to tell with measurements and/or by observing how light
reflects off the rails. Blend these out to a flatter curve.

Also, look for flat sections. These need to be more curved. However this

I use the Mac-specific version Neo Office, and it has opened almost
every file I created in Office 2003 with no problems.  The only
exceptions were for Power Point slide shows, which required some
fiddling to make work.

Specifically, the spreadsheet in the current version of Neo Office (or
Open Office) is quite good.  It&#39;s a little deficient in the graphing
capabilities, but otherwise supports every feature I use.  It
certainly opens every file from this group.  It will also save in
Excel format, so it&#39;s possible to share files with others.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I am not very vocal on this list, but I have learned so much and I 
want to contribute a spreadsheet and instructions to generate a 
facing schedule for all those who have been asking about this the 
last few days. I spent yesterday putting together a package by 
modifying Keith&#39;s Facing Curve spreadsheet so that any one should be 
able to use it.

Open Office is working on a Solver feature, but apparently there is 
some raw nerves and some controversy on the solver issue. I tried an 
Open Office solver add-in and it does not work the same as the Excel 
solver. The Go-Oo version of Open Office Calc solver also does not 
work. Neither does the Gnumeric version--at least not the same as 
Excel.

I have uploaded a file in the How to area called Facing 
Schedule.zip.  It has a spreadsheet and a text file with some 
instructions to use the spreadsheet.  I know there has been some 
concerns about using a spreadsheet other than Excel.  I have tested 
this spreadsheet with Open Office Calc 2.3.1 and Gnumeric 1.7.2 on 
Windows XP.  They are both free spreadsheets so no more whining about 
spending $$$.  I don&#39;t have a Mac or other OS, so I&#39;m sorry about 
that.

If you have Excel 2000, 2002, or 2003, the instructions show you how 
to use the Solver function to solve for the curve.  If you do not, 
there is a manual method, explained step by step to get an accurate 
value for the curve. It&#39;s not too bad.  It is repetitive, but I think 
you can get a good curve in 5 minutes.

I think I covered everything in the instructions.  I hope you find it 
useful.  Many thanks to Keith and this list.

Willis
