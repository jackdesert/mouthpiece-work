Somebody please post the link to Jon Van Wie&#39;s site for Tom.

I will send him the pdf manuals I have.

Tom, I would also refer you to some of the files in our archives.  There
is a three part article by Santy Runyon from about 1960.  It describes
various tip opening and facing length, facing contours, effects of
baffle and chamber shape, and other things that affect the clarinet
mouthpiece, but these things apply to saxophone, too.

Please explore these archives.

I have a number of big projects out of the way now, and will try to
shoot some video in the next few weeks.

Jon&#39;s site is not like it was.  But archives can be found at:

http://www.archive.org/

Just type in jonvanwie.com

This works with a lot of sites that are now gone or have changed.  
The free sites, like Yahoo Geocities, are not archived.

lot of ground.  Many of us here are self-taught.  If there is a 
particular area giving you fits, post a specific question on it.

I found that the easiest way to do this is to download the archives 
in text format from the Files/Grouped Posts section (great idea, 
Keith).

At one time, I had downloaded them all, edited out the fluff and 
printed it in manual form. Too bad I lost all that work when my hard 
drive went south.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have stopped creating new message archives.  They were more work than I
wanted to do on a on-going basis.  I did some editting when I created them.
 Mostly, I took out all the redundant quoting of discussions.  Also, 
deleted some web graphics that took up a lot of space inside the Word file.

If some members would like to create some additional file archives and post
them, feel free to do so.
