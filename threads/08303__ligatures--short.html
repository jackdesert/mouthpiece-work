            <pre class='message__body'>Ok, I think we all have a lot of ligatures in a shoe box somewhere. Why?

I have my preferences of ligatures. Different on clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxes. 

I have no scientific proof. Some just feel better than others. I am not saying they play or sound better but they may. The ones I use are more comfortable which must in some way make me play a little better. 

My Kasper clarinet ligature on clarinet sparkled the minute I put it on and have only tried the others again just to prove that it was great. It is. 

Again, not scientific but for me pragmatic.
