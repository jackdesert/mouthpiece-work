            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:

I would like to get a dial indicator to meaure tips with.  Does 
anyone know where I could get one without buying the Winslow kit?  I 
already have a Morgan, plus files, paper, the Eric Brand and Morgan 
mouthpiece texts, etc.

Thanks,

BK

            <pre class='message__body'>The Winslow gage is a standard dial indicator mounted in a custom made
metal block.  McMaster-Carr and other industrial supplies companies (MSC,
Grainger) have dial indicators.  You&#39;ll need a friendly machinist to make
the block for you.  Its probably anodized Aluminum, but I don&#39;t know that
for sure.  Steel would be too heavy and would rust unless plated.

I&#39;m finding a machinist&#39;s depth gage with a 6" long base works quite well. 
I got one for $60 off eBay.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, the gauge in the Winslow kit (Madison Enterprises) is in a black 
anodized aluminum fixture. 

 

You could also try this, as shown to me by Ron Coelho.  On the butt end 
of your glass gauge, you have a hole drilled that is big enough to let 
the depth probe end of a dial caliper go though.  Or you could get a 
piece of tempered glass cut and edges dressed for this purpose.  Place 
the glass over the mouthpiece so that the hole is over the tip, and 
measure through the hole to the tip rail.  Then subtract the thickness 
of the glass.  That is your tip opening.
