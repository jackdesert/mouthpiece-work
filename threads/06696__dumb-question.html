Seriously, the .0015" feeler is it.  No formula, whatever the .0015" feeler measures is considered the facing length.

Hi, ok i have a dumb little question. How do i find the exact spot where the facing meets the table. I understand the .0015 feeler is pretty close but it is not exact. Is there some kind of formula or something? Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>As Paul says, it is pretty much an industry standard to call the .0015" feeler measurment the facing length.  
 
What you were thinking about is the true tangent point where the facing curve meets the flat table.  This can be found by fitting mathemetical curves through your feeler data.  Take a look in the Files section for some spreadsheets that do a radial fit to the data.  One of the parameters on the sheet is the tangent point.
 
I suspect there are a few companies who consider the tangent point the facing length.  Most do not supply facing lengths to the public so it is hard to tell.  But I have some old Selmer and Vandoren info that implies that the tangent point was used as the facing length.  Whenever I compare an actual mouthpiece reading to these charts, the .0015" feeler reading is usually shorter than Selmer and Vandoren chart facing lengths.  
 
I also suspect that both measure tip openings at the very tip of the mouthpiece.  Most other makers measure inside the tip rail.
