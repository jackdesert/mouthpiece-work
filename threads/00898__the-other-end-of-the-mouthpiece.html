            <pre class='message__body'>the shank. I pulled out my old standby Guy Hawkins metal tenor piece, 
and apparently at some point had dropped it, landing not on the tip
(thankfully) but on the shank, so it&#39;s now out of round. What is the 
best way to get it back into round? any special tools needed?

            <pre class='message__body'>Uhh, that would be a special tool Bill.

I&#39;d see what I have laying around.  A drumstick, dowel, metal shaft and try
to roll it out.  Sometimes a pair of pliers can be opened up inside if the
fit is close.
