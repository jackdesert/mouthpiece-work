            <pre class='message__body'>I bought a used Backun clarinet  mouthpiece direct from Backun. I first notice that it had an odd smell and  then that the tip and side rails were rather wide and that the curve was a full 21 mm, extremely long for a clarinet.
   It played quite well but the shank was about 1.5 mm  too long for the barrel.
  When  I started sanding the shank down I noticed that  even though it was a Zinner blank, it was  plastic,not rubber and that was the source of the odd smell.
   Then I saw letters on  on the end of the shank,  www.muncywinds .com and some numbers as well.
  When I  then fixed the tip rail  the sandpaper became nice and brown and had a  rubber smell so the actual mouthpiece must be hard rubber.
  Is this possibly a repair with a plastic shank ? I don&#39;t see any lines inside where  the two parts would join.
    I got the table down to  a  decent clarinet range and the tip rail  narrow and even. I lost the little concave in the table and the tip is still a little more open than what the Backun spec says it should be but it is a nice 1.12 mm, 17.5 and it plays well as it is. Over all it is  nice purchase for the price I paid.
   I am curious. Any comments?

 I thought someone here would know about Zinner blanks. Perhaps I need to
contact Backun as well as Muncy Winds. They&#39;re both supposed to be very
approachable and customer friendly.  Peter
