Until now I have only done simple refacing of hard rubber and plastic mouth

one need both refacing and replating. Have anyone tried to reface copper? Is it

            <pre class='message__body'>The issue appears to be the dust:

From wikipedia:

As beryllium compounds are toxic there are some safety concerns for handling
its alloys. In solid form and as finished parts, beryllium copper presents
no particular health hazard. However, breathing its dust, as formed when
machining or welding may cause serious lung damage.[2] Beryllium compounds
are known human carcinogens when inhaled.[3]

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve read warnings about dust when machining cast iron, too.

There are a number of metals and other materials, such as particle board when doing carpentry, certain woods, that the dust is hazardous.

Ditto cement (silicosis).

Guys, while I&#39;m not saying you need to go to a full face air fed respirator, it would not hurt at all to keep a supply of the paper dust masks.  They are cheap and easily available.  And for what we do, the little "3-pack" from Home Depot is not enough.  Most cities have safety supply houses, or hardware stores that stock the larger boxes of 3M dust masks.

When working around power tools, Dremel tool, lathe, drill press, etc, WEAR YOUR DAMNED SAFETY GLASSES!!!  Don&#39;t make me tell you again!  Hahahah... Seriously, it&#39;s not fun having metal particles picked out of your eyes.  Abrasive grinding bits or fiber cutoff wheels can explode.

Table saws, or other noisy tools, hearing protection.  Yes, I do keep all this stuff in my workshop.

Use good ventilation when working with volatile chemicals.  Rubber gloves if necessary.  Solvents easily enter your bloodstream either through inhalation or skin absorbtion.

Years ago while still in school I worked in a toy & hobby shop.  Among the other items we sold, we had a great selection of board games and puzzles.  I and one of the other employees were in our early 20&#39;s at that time.  

There was one lady about our age that would come in every Friday afternoon after she got off work to buy a large puzzle.  We jokingly called her "the puzzle lady".  What made her notable, she had slurred speech, staggered slightly, as if drunk, but she never had the odor of liquor.

Usually she paid cash, but one day she asked if she could pay with a check.  While she was writing the check I asked her where she worked... at a factory there in town, which was famous for its beautiful collector dolls.  These were not dolls you give to little girls to play with, but fancy dolls you see on bookshelves and mantles.

"What do you do there?" we asked. 

"I wash heads," she answered.  She explained, the vinyl doll heads, when they come out of the machine, before they can be painted (lipstick, eyebrows, rosy cheeks) had to be perfectly clean.  She washed the doll heads in a big sink of carbon tetrachloride.  All day long.  

And we watched her stagger out of the store.

Wear appropriate safety equipment.  Don&#39;t take this lightly just because you are working at home or in your workshop.

Been there, done that, steel splinter.

Not too bad until the local anesthetic wore off an hour later. Then, some
serious pain. A lesson learned the hard way.
