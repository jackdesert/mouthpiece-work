            <pre class='message__body'>HI there,

I have alto vandoren jumbo java which has no ramp into the chamber of 
the mouthpiece and I was wondering what effect it would have if I was 
to put one in like my guardala studio mouthpiece.  I&#39;ve noticed that 
dukoff also have wall and no ramp.  Has anyone every experiemented with 
this?  Does it help the air flow? And make the piece less bright?
To save confusion, I am refering the point where the window goes into 
the chamber on the other side of the table.
Thanks,
Gary

 Use poster hanging putty, dental wax, silly putty, Play-Doh, etc.

I would expect it to sound brighter in the low register.  A little more
"brat" to the sound, but this may be more noticable on tenor and bari. It
also might takes some edge out of the tone.  It will make the chamber a
little smaller so you will need to pull out a little to tune the mid range
of the sax.  This will make the palm keys slightly flatter than they were
and/or the low notes slightly sharper.  It may not be noticable but it
could fix or create a problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

I think you missed which part of the mouthpiece I&#39;m talking about. My 
mouthpiece doesn&#39;t have a ramp at all or, you were referring to the 
baffle side.  I&#39;m not referring to the baffle side of the chamber but 
the other side.  I was think of filing away at the edge of the window 
back into the chamber so the air doesn&#39;t hit the wall at the butt end 
of the reed.  (Sorry, it&#39;s so hard to describe in words some this 
stuff) 
Does this change your advice?

Thanks,
Gary Honor

            <pre class='message__body'>Ohhh.  You mean undercutting the base of the Window "U"?   You can just
grab a file and go at it with a few strokes.  It might add some clarity to
the tone.  Some classical players like to keep this wall blunt since they
feel it adds some blowing resistance in a way they like.

I usually chamfer it to take 1/2-2/3 of the wall away.
