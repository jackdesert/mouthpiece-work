This is my first Post in this Group.
The last weeks I have read some of the
articles in this group.
Many Thanks to all who pass thier knowledge.

My Question:

(like Message 132)

I have heard that there is Lead and Metal from old tin cans
(recycled iron)in it.

Does anybody know somthing about this ?



Thanks
Mark A.



for all of you who like to know somthing about me
and my background.
My Name is Markus Auer (build in 67 like good Saxes)
I live in Austria. The Village I live is called
Schruns. A small Village in the Alps.
why such a Name like super_dynaction_s1.
all the good names with mark are assigned.
and after 20 min for searching a name with mark
i test super dynaction s1 and it works.
I have a small Sax Collection with 4 Tenor Horns
Buffet Superdynaction Transitional from 74, Buffet S1 from 74,
King Zephyr with Sterling Silver Neck from 48 and a Jupiter.
there are also three Alto´s.
for Alto I have a Buffet Superdynaction from 64,
Selmer Super Action 80 II from 87 and a Mogar Marque Deposee.
I have played Saxophon from 87 to 91 then paused and
since 2001 I play Sax every Day for 1-2 hours.
Still working to get better.

I reface Mouthpieces for one and a half year.
My Collection of MPC´s are ca. 60 pieces.
And some of them I have refaced. (but only the pieces
who doesn´t play fine when i get them)

Refacing is similary to my Job.
I´m working as a Die corector in a Aluminium Extrusion company.
My job is to fine tuning the tools for extrusion.
So working in 0,01mm range with diamond needle files
and and other tools you like to have for refacing is my daily job.

Now you know something about me.
(Sorry for my bad english but only learned
in shool for 4 years)

I think it was JVW who also said something to that effect about the 
Dukoff. He said that it is mostly how the tip interacts with the 
reed&#39;s vibrations.

For the last few days, I&#39;ve been try to copy my favorite Dukoff tenor 
piece but in stainless steel rather than tweaking another Silverite 
Dukoff. This is the first time I&#39;ve tried to do major work with 
stainless steel and its eating my lunch, or at least all my Dremel 
bits. I&#39;m using a tungsten carbine cutting bit for the bulk of the 
work and a diamond fine point for defining the tip rail before going 
after it with the files.

So far, my copy is a pretty good match.  I&#39;ve been able to get the 
facing and the baffle exactly the same. I painstakingly took facing 
measurements with every almost feeler in the set and then at every 
0.005" from 80 up to 120. For me, the baffle is tough to duplicate 
exactly since it is hard to take good depth measurements across the 
facing. To measure the baffle just behind the tip, I hang the tip off 
the edge of the glass with the facing against edge. The end of the 
feeler gages can then be used to measure the baffle depth. The first 
3mm behind the tip seems to be the "make it or break it" area of the 
Dukoff baffle. If it is high as it can be without causing the reed to 
bottom out, it seems to add a brightness and complexity to the sound 
that you can&#39;t get with the typical long, high baffle. It has to be 
just right, though, since many Dukoffs aren&#39;t finished well and the 
reed bottoms out there causing chirps or stuffiness.

I think that all that needs to be done now is to shape the chamber a 
little more and it will be a very good copy. Internally, they have 
almost exact internal measurements. The internal volume of the Dukoff 
is slightly higher but its shank is 3mm longer. Also, the walls of 
the stainless steel mouthpiece are slightly thinner. The original and 
copy play very much the same but the buzz in my teeth is a little 
different. It could be as simple as a different bite plate. Tonight 
I&#39;ll be in the studio and I hope to record some clips of the two if 
there is time.

Ok, I&#39;m done rambling. I sure appreciate everyone&#39;s expertise in this 
group. I would not have had the knowledge or confidence to try little 
projects like these without everybody&#39;s help.

Jon
