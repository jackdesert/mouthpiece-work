They all have a wonderfull low octave sound and play very easy, but I touched them trying to get a richer sound in the higher octave.. helas with bad results...
With patience and Mojos worksheets I worked on them, they plop, they play fantastic over the whole octavespectrum, but get thin above A.

thanx Barry
In fact the the baffle area is the most important portion, the angle between the 
bafle surface and the plan of the table determines the brigthness of the sound.
But the Morgans have a really flat roof and nearly no pronounced baffle and I 
kept those parameters nearly inchanged.

Since you&#39;ve reworked the facing, I&#39;m guessing that now the baffle is too

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, it may be another issue entirely, but if you have an un-altered
Morgan, check the last 1/4" of baffle before the tip rail. I would be
interested to hear if it was perfectly flat all the way to the tip rail.

Removal of material from the curved end of the facing will change the
relationship of the region just behind the tip rail to the end of the facing
- and that region is extremely sensitive to very small changes.

Adding to the difficulty (in my opinion anyway) is that it&#39;s difficult to
measure the curvature of that region.

I&#39;ve used a profiling device when trying to duplicate baffle profiles
between mouthpieces, but I don&#39;t see any obvious reproducible way of
measuring and plotting the curve along the baffle surface, unless there is a
tool like a depth gauge that also includes some kind of calibrated stop at
right angles to the depth probe in order to maintain various distances from
the tip.

In fact I compared it to Zagar SBB 8 because David Zagar told me it his one has 
""no baffle " compared to my AMMA 7* from TW.
Not very scientific I must agree..
But as I have an recording on 15 January the problem of not finding the right 
sound makes me nervous and instead  blowing I measure most of the time.
Go play now.

Well, it may be another issue entirely, but if you have an un-altered
Morgan, check the last 1/4" of baffle before the tip rail. I would be
interested to hear if it was perfectly flat all the way to the tip rail.

Removal of material from the curved end of the facing will change the
relationship of the region just behind the tip rail to the end of the facing

Assuming it&#39;s the piece, this could be a number of things.  OK usually one of 2 
things -- either too high a baffle or the facing is too low or too flat toward 
the front or too long altogether.  That it plays beautifully at the bottom makes 
me think the curve might be too long.
