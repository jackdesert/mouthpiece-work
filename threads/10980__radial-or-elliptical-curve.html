For a given tip opening and facing length, there is only one radial curve that will be tangent to the table.  There will be many elliptical curves with each one have a different aspect ratio.   The higher the aspect ration, the more elliptical the curve and the more resistance it will have.  An aspect ratio of one gives a curve that is the same as a radial curve.  This is the most free blowing curve I have found for a given tip opening and facing length.
 
But a long facing elliptical curve can flay free-er than a short facing radial curve.  So you need to get a feel for what works for the mouthpiece type and the type of playing a player does.

Ok! Keith Bradbury,

Sorry my Inglês!


Thank you for the response, I&#39;m your fan, I watched all your videos on Youtube. Very good, excellent! Not only his work with the mouthpieces, but also playing the saxes. I&#39;m learning a lot from your videos and answers on this forum!

Then, as your answer, the question revolves around whether or not to apply resistance, which will define the resistance value of the ratio (> 1).

What is the maximum amount that could reach the Elliptical Ratio?

How to construct a curve that balances the entire length of the alto sax? What are the variables for this goal?

Thank you,

Stay with God!

            <pre class='message__body'>The max ellipse I think is useful for a facing curve has an aspect ratio of 10.  This would be useful for a close tip opening classical soprano sax mouthpiece.  

Medium resistance for medium tip openings for all saxes is in the 3 to 5 range.  Large tip openings usually need to be paired with low resistance facing curves.

The only rule is there are no rules.  If find a mouthpiece you like, plot the facing curve measurements and compare them to a mathematical curve to find out why.

Thank you Keith for previous answers,

to finish this theme of facing curves, I wonder what measures the length of curves that are considered: small, medium, large, and maximum length. 

What measures for each type mentioned in the feeler 0.0015 and feeler 0.0000 (absolute length) for the variable AVG L (mm), Radial (mm) and elliptical (mm)?

How do you define these measures, there is some mathematical relationship for this? Would be a percentage ratio based on the length of the mouthpiece, for example?


thank you very much for your attention!

On my web site at Mojomouthpiecework.com, click on the Clinic menu and my Power Point presentation from Jan 2009.  Slide 19 has the elliptical curve formulation.  A/B is the aspect ratio I have been speaking about.  
 
Many years ago, Paul Coats posted ranges of facing lengths (to the .0015" feeler) that he has observed as working well:
 
Sop 34-40
Alto 40-44
Tenor 44-48
Bari 48-52
 
I tend to use the longer side of these.  Most refacing work is for jazz and rock tenor players.  I find they prefer 48-52 facing lengths.

Thank you, Keith, for stating that correctly, that those are observations, just as I observe most automobiles have four wheels.  There are certainly particular samples which fall outside of these ranges.

It so happens that I face mouthpieces in those length ranges, which, are as read on an E. Brand type glass gauge.  That is, a reading of 44 is 22 mm.

And as Keith and others have pointed out, a mouthpiece facing is more than simply a tip opening.  Generally with a longer facing it will take a wider tip opening to play well.  And then you are using a different portion of the reed.  Reed strength and cut will have quite an impact.

Then you get into issues of wide tip, short facing, or vice versa.

Even with two mouthpieces that have identical measurements of facing, the contour of the baffle will have an effect.  In one case, though I normally play about 0.100" tip opening (2.5 mm) with 23 mm facing length ("46") on tenor saxophone, for one particular mouthpiece mode that exact facing felt too small.  I was able to easily play a larger tip opening 0.110" (2.8 mm) with the same 23 mm facing length ("46") with no fatigue.  Due to the way the baffle interacted with the reed, this larger tip opening felt similar to the narrower tip on other mouthpieces.

After all of this, back to the reed.  It is a mistake to use only one reed, or your favorite type and strength when experimenting with mouthpieces.  You may very well find a different reed that really makes a new mouthpiece play.

Paul

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks.  No special files for tip work - just the $3.95 HF sets (coarse/fine) for rough cutting, diamond files for finer work, and lapidary grits on old files covered with leather to finish.  

I don&#39;t have a problem with tools getting dull, anymore than with any other material.  I think most people&#39;s experience with stainless steel is probably attempting to reface a Berg Larsen, which has become work-hardened.  An annealed 304 rod cuts pretty easily (though still more slowly than HR or brass), being more gummy rather than hard.  It sticks to the tools and will load up a file quickly.  As the stainless professionals in industry say, "Stainless steel is not more difficult to work, it is just different, requiring a different technique."  If you attack it as you would HR or brass, you will ruin your tools.

I love the results.  While it cuts slower, the work is more precise and it stays that way.  After making a few, I&#39;m inclined to agree with Geoff Lawton, "Brass is a boy&#39;s material." :-)

      Nice work.  You using anything special w/r/t files for stainless?  One of the big drawbacks for me going down this route is the extra time the facing and tip work take.

It would be great to have some kind of table correlating reeds and reed cuts with various types of facings, something that would give recommendations on which reeds to try with which kinds of facings and tip openings, so that folks don&#39;t have to try every kind of reed out with each mouthpiece. 

Does anyone have the know-how to put something like that together?

            <pre class='message__body'>you would have to have on hand examples of the reeds and mouthpieces to be tested....the profile of the reed has a huge influence on the way a given reed performs on a given facing curve.....this relationship is often overlooked......it is also important that any reed being evaluated be balanced and adjusted.....the mouthpieces our company manufactures are optimized for LaVoz reeds, by design

I can do 15 or 20 other mouthpieces in the time it takes to reface one Berg.  I don&#39;t have that much time left in my life.  

I&#39;ll be happy to send you any Berg customers I come across.  ;-)

            <pre class='message__body'>I occasionally take on a SS Berg if I think I can make a significant improvement to it with less than 2 hours of work.   Just a little table flattening for 45 min or so and the rest on side rail curve shape and tip rail work.  No opening or closing the tip.

I can do 15 or 20 other mouthpieces in the time it takes to reface one Berg.  I don&#39;t have that much time left in my life.  



I&#39;ll be happy to send you any Berg customers I come across.  ;-)

            <pre class='message__body'>My new stainless steel soprano mouthpiece, for old, vintage sopranos.

Disconnect the stupid C# gizmo, &#39;cause it&#39;s not needed.  C#3 comes out of the C# tone hole, like it should.

1926 Martin Handcraft straight soprano with gizmo key linkage removed:
