I was just going through all the messages ever posted because I&#39;m

Anyway, I noticed that people were recommending Winslow mouthpiece

I looked up using google but none I could find.
So is there anywhere you can get this kit or is there any good

Thanks guys.

Winslow will occassionally deal with customers directly, but they 
have also been difficult at times.  They seem to have an odd 
bisiness "plan".

Many of us have just made up our own kits.  There are sources listed 
for individual items recommended.

We have discussed this in the past but we are getting so many posts 
now, it is difficult to wade through them all and find stuff.  The 
Search feature on the Yahoo site often does not produce info that I 
know has been previously posted.  If you still can not find what you 
are looking for, ask again and we&#39;ll help out.

Welcome!

Hiro,

I would look for alternatives.  The Winslow Kit has been out of stock for a
year or two.  In the last few weeks I met with one of the sons involved in
Madison Enterprises (Winslow&#39;s Business Name) and he thought they "might"
first have stock later this year or in 2005.

On alternative kits check the archives of this list for suggestions.  I
think Paul Coats may have some new information, soon if not at the present,
on Refacing Kits.

Hiro,

I would look for alternatives.  The Winslow Kit has been out of stock for a
year or two.  In the last few weeks I met with one of the sons involved in
Madison Enterprises (Winslow&#39;s Business Name) and he thought they "might"
first have stock later this year or in 2005.
