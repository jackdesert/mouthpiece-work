> Hi group,
>
> This may be old news by now, but I just got a message ostensibly from
kwbradbury with the header "Hi, japanese girl vs Playboy". This should make
it immediately obvious it&#39;s not from Keith. If you receive something similar
delete it immediately. It is infected with the W32 Klez H worm.
>
> Since this worm can spoof a sender&#39;s address it is not necessarily Keith
who is infected--it could be anyone who has Keith in their address book. If
you suspect that you might be infected go to this link

> http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h@...
>
> where you can learn more and also download a free utility to check and if
necessary disinfect your machine.
>
> Hope we are all clean.
