            <pre class='message__body'>At http://www.ridenourclarinetproducts.com/ you will find Tom 
Ridenour&#39;s reed adjustment tool along with a very good book and DVD 
about how and why reeds work (or don&#39;t). It is worth the investment 
and has increased my good reeds by 50% which in my book is 
significant. It has also cut the time I work on reeds in half.
