            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone know of a site like this [MouthpieceWork] with reeds in
mind specifically? I can&#39;t find any sites which are as "scientific" in
approach, and I&#39;d like to learn a few things, like why some reeds feel
more "open" or "closed", etc., and know that the information I&#39;m
getting is based on empirical data and not opinion.

Thanks,
Doug

It may not be exactly what you are looking for Doug but check out the
reed section 2:4 of www.bobrk.com/saxfaq/saxfaq.txt       Eddie.

            <pre class='message__body'>At http://www.ridenourclarinetproducts.com/ you will find Tom 
Ridenour&#39;s reed adjustment tool along with a very good book and DVD 
about how and why reeds work (or don&#39;t). It is worth the investment 
and has increased my good reeds by 50% which in my book is 
significant. It has also cut the time I work on reeds in half.
