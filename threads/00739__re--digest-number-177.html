            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m not convinced that volume is the governing factor for pitch. My 
understanding is that the reason high notes are affected more than low notes 
by pulling out is simply that the length of the air column is shorter for 
high notes, so the same amount of pullout has a larger percentage effect on 
the pitch.

I also still wonder if anyone knows what it is about the 12M bari that makes 
it so touchy and if anyone has suggestions about mouthpieces with more 
projection that will play well on it.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Lawton has some interesting intonation quirks on a 12M Bari, it is
playable but you have to be very careful with intonation. The Quantum
has effortless intonation and a big sound on a 12M. They also play
exceptionally well on 10M&#39;s and Chu&#39;s too.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Glenn,

What you say is true--that when you pull out the mpc you change the length of the air column of the notes high on the tube more relative to those lower down. This is a linear relationship. But the relative effects of the a mpc/air column mismatch as related to the mpc replacing the missing apex of the cone only shows up when the wavelength of the note is equal to or exceeds one quarter the length of the truncation. That is an additional effect to further complicate our lives on top of the earlier consideration.
