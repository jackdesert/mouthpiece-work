Keith,
  I&#39;d take 2 as well at anything around $25 each. Sorry I would have spoken 
up sooner but I didn&#39;t realize we had gotten to the point of ordering yet.

BTW, thanks for doing all the initial design work as well.

Keith Ley

Hi all, I was curious if anyone knew a good place to get grenadilla blanks. Or if anyone has any other suggestions as to good types of wood to use for mouthpieces and where i could get them. I looked in the Links section and the link to Northwest Woodworking did not work so i wasn&#39;t sure if that was still a source. Thanks
