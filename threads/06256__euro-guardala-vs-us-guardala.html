            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone know anything about the differences between the European 
laser trimmed Guardalas and the Woodwind and Brasswind Guardalas?

I saw some Euro site where they were offering what appeared to be the 
run of the mill laser trimmed mouthpieces, but there were different 
models (the NEW Crescent and the Branford model) that don&#39;t seem to be 
available in the US- and there were also models were available for 
Alto.  Also, there was a "hand finished" option.  Obviously not 
finished by Guardala himself- but what&#39;s the deal with these things?  
Marketing gimmick or is there actually a difference?  In addition to 
offering new models not available in the US- they were a lot more 
expensive.

Has anyone played these or mapped out the facing curves to see if they 
are the same as the US models?

            <pre class='message__body'>Guardala sold his company... twice.  This is a matter of public record.
   
  He sold the company to LA Sax in the US.  He also sold the company to a man in Germany.  Both produced mouthpieces under the Guardala name.  And his employee/business partner (Powell?) sold mouthpieces from their stock.
   
  The confusion is of Guardala&#39;s own making.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Folks,
                 I want to thank everybody that has emailed me privately
and/or called me and were so kind to answer all my questions regarding this
topic. I knew, from the start, that it would be a touchy question to ask on
a public forum.
But, everyone showed remarkable restraint, as well as an incredible interest
in providing the facts on the matter. I thank and applaud all of you for
that -- you have proven that all of you are true professionals!
 
Thanks again - I very much appreciate all of you, and this fantastic mailing
list!
 
Sincerely,
               Karsten J. Chikuri
