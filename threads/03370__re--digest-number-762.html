That was me... while I don&#39;t have the ability to measure the Link Bootman did for me, I would NOT say it&#39;s a short facing, it appears rather long to the naked eye, and given the fact that I can play a 3 reed on it (.115) the same as I play on a Rovner Deep V (.100) I would guess its longer rather than shorter.

He told me he used JVW&#39;s facing curve if that helps. ;) 

I was actually surprised, I played it on a whim last week at a rock and roll gig, wasn&#39;t sure it would cut, but it does give me the ability to play softly more easily, while retaining the same tone.(important with the clip on wireless) I find on some pieces when you back off the sound can change, and not in a good way. For me at least.

Hope that helps.

I recently talked with someone who plays one at times.  He also sent 
pics.  Shortening the facing will emphasize the high notes and the 
baffle adds substantial edge.  He stated it retained the general link 
quality but was much more powerful, and had a lot of cut...Ive 
experimented a fair bit with baffles lately and a lot of baffle really 
alters the character of the piece in my opinion.  It kind of starts 
being more like a tame Dukoff rather than a link on steroids.  He likes 
it for certain gigs.
