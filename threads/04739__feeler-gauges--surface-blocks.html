            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I got a set of feeler gauges up to .035" at an auto parts store (Pep Boys) for
$5-$10. When supplemented with the larger feeler gauges made by Jeff Rosner
(of this group), I have a very complete set up to .125". A workable, but less-
than- perfect alternative is to stack the smaller gauges to add up to the
larger sizes.

            <pre class='message__body'>There is another source for larger feelers at:

http://www.mitchellstore.com/

I have not tried these, but they should work.  I recommend you use a 
micrometer to measure the actual edge thickness of feelers in the area 
you will be using them.  They can be off a little.  Probably not 
significant, but there is no reason to not account for small errors 
that are easily measured.

For a work surface, I use 9 x 11.5 x 3/8" thick glass with beveled 
edges from the local glass store.

          Hello all,

I apologize if this has been gone over before, but...

The link on the mouthpiecework site for the feeler gauges is down (the one in the tools document for sjrosner.mindspring or whatever it is), and I can&#39;t seem to find an appropriate set for refacing anywhere for sale online.  Most of the sets I see are missing sizes and so far I haven&#39;t been to a site that allows me to select the specific sizes I want.  

Also anybody know where I can find a high-quality and reasonably sized granite surface block?  Anybody recommend anything different?

Thanks in advance.

I updated the tools file to point to Jeff&#39;s new location:

http://www.shmuelyosef.com/Saxophones/index.html

However Jeff is not offering the larger feelers at this time.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanx for the pointer...I sold out two batches, a total of 150 feeler 
sets...thanx, everyone!!! I&#39;m not planning to make any more...the 
time to grind the edges exactly flat and parallel is not worth the 
cost. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a source of feeler 
stock that is not edge-radiused, which makes the usage very 
imprecise, so the hand finish-work is required.
