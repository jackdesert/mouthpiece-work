 Is there such a thing, as a jig to hold and measure (more accurately) mouthpieces? One that will precisely hold the mp while a ball type depth gage can measure all points on the table, rails, and tip? Of course, it must accurately pin point every reading from a mp glass gage.

Is there such a thing, as a jig to hold and measure (more accurately)
mouthpieces? One that will precisely hold the mp while a ball type depth gage
can measure all points on the table, rails, and tip? Of course, it must
accurately pin point every reading from a mp glass gage.
