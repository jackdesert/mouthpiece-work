 Is there such a thing, as a jig to hold and measure (more accurately) mouthpieces? One that will precisely hold the mp while a ball type depth gage can measure all points on the table, rails, and tip? Of course, it must accurately pin point every reading from a mp glass gage.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a machinists vise…..I padded the jaws, of course, but it seems to hold any mouthpiece from sopranino through bass securely……the brand I use is Wilton, and it&#39;s size #4……I&#39;ve had it a long time, and don&#39;t remember where I bought it……Santy Runyon had one exactly like it
