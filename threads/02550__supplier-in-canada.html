Ralph,

I got my glass gauges from Babbitt, my .035-.125" feelers from Jeff 
Rosner in California, my feelers from .0015-.025" from Canadian Tire, 
my granite facing plate from Lee Valley Tools, the abrasive paper 
(600-2000)from Canadian Tire or any auto body supply place, my 
digital calipers from Lee Valley, JB Weld and CA gel glues from Can. 
Tire, epoxy resin and glass cloth from Tender Craft Boat shop in 
Toronto.

I recently repaired a Berg bari shank with the epoxy and cloth. Very 
strong repair, and much easier and lighter than putting a metal 
sleeve on a long shank like that.
