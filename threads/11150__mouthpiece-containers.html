Can anyone suggest a source of mouthpiece containers - boxes or plastic
tubes - for clarinet and sax mouthpieces. I have the usual drawer full of
mouthpieces that I&#39;ve tried and discarded over the years. Most are still in
their original containers, but several are in plastic bags or in the boxes
that held my current mouthpieces and will need to hold them again if and
when I have a new bout of wanderlust that drives me to try something new.

 

Thanks in advance,

Karl

At Home Depot, and I&#39;m sure at Lowe&#39;s, too, you will find some clear plastic tubes, with various colored vinyl caps on each end, in a range of sizes that would be perfect for mouthpieces.  These are sold for organizing your workbench, sorting screws and nuts and other small items into them.

I would put some foam in each end.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi.  I have plenty of experience with containers for all woodwind
 mouthpieces.  I have used three different types:  heavy wall clear acrylic
cylindrical tubes with black rubber ends.  !.75 diameter. Long tubes had to
be cut.  Half way through  (I had over 200 mouthpieces I got the catalogs
out).  Next I bought precut 1.5&#39; diameter clear  acrylic  with moderately
thin sidewall.  They cane with clear  bottoms and a  nice black good
fitting  black tops.  These worked great until the top  of the tube
stretched and the top no longer stayed in place.  The final purchase was
1.5" paper tube. These are opaque cut to 8"   I never used them.  I still
have many of these that you can have for the price of postage.  i had built
at couple of very nice display shelves that are also available.

Notice the stuff stuck to each container.  There is some solution that will
soften the mastic and make it easier to remove the paper.   On the various
stickers are brand, condition,  facing curve, tip opening, ... and how much
I paid and how much I&#39;m asking. I sod many mps with this set up.

Let me know if you are interested.

      Can anyone suggest a source of mouthpiece containers – boxes or plastic tubes – for clarinet and sax mouthpieces. I have the usual drawer full of mouthpieces that I’ve tried and discarded over the years. Most are still in their original containers, but several are in plastic bags or in the boxes that held my current mouthpieces and will need to hold them again if and when I have a new bout of wanderlust that drives me to try something new.

I use the "fishing tackle" type of clear plastic divided boxes.  The best ones I found were at a fabric store (probably for use in holding spools of thread).  Dividers could be adjusted for tenor, alto, ligatures, etc., and it&#39;s easy to tell what&#39;s inside them.
