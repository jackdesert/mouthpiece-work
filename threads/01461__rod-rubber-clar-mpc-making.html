            <pre class='message__body'>Jim, hard rubber, or rod rubber, can only be machined very slowly, and 
must be cooled with a water stream during the operations.  Otherwise it 
burns, melts.  Hard rubber is not at all stable, and tables/facings 
easily warp from moderate heat (trunk of car, etc).  Some hard rubber 
mouthpieces are really ABS plastic with ground up rubber in the mix, not 
true hard rubber.  Some batches of hard rubber have odor problems that 
are not appreciated by the players, a smell of burnt rubber.

 

HOWEVER, a better material is available... Delrin.  Delrin is 
"self-lubricating" and is tough!  It is used for gears that can handle 
quite a power strain. I first became aware of Delrin used for gears many 
years ago for slot cars, with motors turning well over 50,000 rpms.  
Years later, I saw this material used for gears in gas powered radio 
controlled model cars and even the main rotor gears on R/C helicopters.  
These gears have machined teeth, not molded.  It has vibrational 
characteristics very similar to hard rubber. 

 

You can get white and black Delrin rods in suitable diameters from 
Ferree&#39;s Tools.  They stock the small sizes for making replacement tone 
holes for clarinets, or tenons.  I think you can get up to 1.5" or 1.75" 
diameters from them.  While you can&#39;t really get a high polish with 
Delrin, it machines beautifully.   You can machine it quite thin without 
worrying about breakage.  It is not at all brittle.

            <pre class='message__body'>Merlin:  The Runyon pieces made from Delrin are machined, not molded, 
from Delrin rod stock.  These include the Custom Quantums and the XL 
line.  They are machined on the same machines as the Runyon metal 
mouthpieces.  The Runyon molded mouthpieces are molded of a proprietary 
"plastic alloy".

 

Machining from Delrin is a great way to make mouthpieces for instruments 
such as sopranino or bass and contrabass saxophones.  No worries about 
plating, cutting the beak for a plastic biteplate, etc.  I am surprised 
no one is making clarinet bells and barrels of this material.

            <pre class='message__body'>Many clarinetists use barrels either made of Delrin, or have a 
Delrin sleeve inserted in the barrel. I use both and they make tone 
and pitch very stable.

There is 1 metal bell maker and a few custom bell maker using woods 
like cocobolo and others. None that I know of use Delrin.

Guy Chadash and I have been making clarinet mouthpieces from rod 
rubber for a little over a year now, and we&#39;ve been very happy with 
the results.

This is a totally unsolicited endorsement.  As a purchaser of one of the 
Chadash/Hill mouthpieces, I too have been quite satisfied with the 
results.  As in--I&#39;ve never owned a mouthpiece that played 
better.  Whatever they&#39;re doing, it&#39;s working.
