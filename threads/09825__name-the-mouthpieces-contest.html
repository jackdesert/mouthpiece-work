We&#39;re getting close to introducing our new line of three different hard
rubber tenor mouthpieces. They&#39;re all different, of course, and all have
somewhat high

baffles and are pretty aggressive in tone. I need names for both the series
and the individual pieces, and my creative juices have momentarily dried up.

 

In response to this crisis, we&#39;re having a "name the mouthpieces" contest on
the forum at www.nationofmusic.com &lt;http://www.nationofmusic.com/>  ....the
winner gets a set of their choice of

alto or tenor key clamps AND their choice of an alto or tenor neck enhancer.
The only requirement is that all entries be posted on the forum at
