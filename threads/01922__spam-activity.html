            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry about the occassional spam via the MPWork group.  We&#39;ve been 
set up for automatic membership approval for quite a while now.  This 
is a lot less work for me to manage the group.  But this allows users 
to join and quickly send out spam.  I ban them as soon as I see the 
posting.  Hopefully this keeps the spam out of the daily journals, 
but those set to get individual postings will see these messages 
before I can delete them.

If it becomes more frequent than a couple times a month I&#39;ll set it 
to require my approval.  Until that time comes, please bear with it.
