            <pre class='message__body'>As stated on the Yahoo MouthpieceWork Home page:

"This is the only group dedicated to sharing information on woodwind 
mouthpiece making, repair and refacing. Tools, techniques, materials, 
successes, failures can all be gathered at this location for future 
reference. This is the place to learn about mouthpiece refacing!"

I would like to allow occassional off-topic posts and discussions... 
even special "for sale" posts.  By "occassional", I&#39;m thinking of a 
few posts a year that are not about mouthpiece work, not a few posts 
a week.  I would prefer all posts to be mouthpiece related, or at 
least sax or music related.

We have operated for over 2 years without any serious conflicts.  
This is pretty amazing but is possible with a small group like ours.  
Of the 300+ members, only ~125 get the posts daily via their Email.  
When you get 1000&#39;s of members there is a greater probability of the 
problems we have observed on other boards.  

Please continue to exercise good judgement about what you all post at 
MouthpieceWork, and show some tolerance for some of the gray areas.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree...in particular, there has been too much SHOUTING lately.
