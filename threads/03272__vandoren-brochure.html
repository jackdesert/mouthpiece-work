Hi all,

I&#39;ve posted a new file in the Clarinet folder.  It is an older
Vandoren Brochure which has all their sax and clarinet mouthpiece
models (at that time!), specs and a brief description.  I thought some
of you might find this interesting, since the current Vandoren website
does not give the actual facing lengths.  Hope I&#39;m not breaching any
copyright laws by doing this!

I think this came from inside a Vandoren mouthpiece box I bought a
number of years ago, so I figure it was intended as public infomation.

Regards,
Andrew
