            <pre class='message__body'>Can anybody out there comment on how the texture of a baffle might 
effect tone?  In the last couple of weeks I&#39;ve done some fine 
finishing on my soprano pieces - no facing changes - just polishing 
the baffle and chamber.  With 3 different mouthpieces, I am 
completely convinced the tone became darker after polishing the 
baffle.

Has anyone tried to create a textured baffle, maybe adding sand of 
some sort to epoxy? I believe that Yamaha or Selmer have a custom 
neck that has a "bumpy" bore to add brightness.
