            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, Steve -
 
Bob Ackerman says in his notes on the Tenor Sax Mouthpiece that this is the  
first move he makes in a refacing job and he gives his rationale for doing  
so.  _http://www.bobackermansaxophones.com/_

This is one of those areas that can be debated to death.  But that does not
seem to be a problem here yet.

Both flat and concave tables can be made to work well.  I prefer flat.  It
just makes more sense to me than trying to allow for reed swelling that can
be more or less than what you allow for anyway.  As for suction, there is
no vacuum between the reed and the table except for those who use the
suction test.  I suppose a little bit of moisture could collect there and
create a sort-of wet gasket seal.  This probably goes on with any table strategy.

Yes!  If you are having trouble with convex tables while trying to make
them flat, you should consider a concave table.  There is no bump in the
middle to teeter on.
