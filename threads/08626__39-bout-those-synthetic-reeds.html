I thought the Hartman carbon fiber reed was very nice, and that the
Fibracell Premier series was a close second. I didn&#39;t care much for the
standard Fibracell, and pretty strongly disliked the Bari and the Legere.

When we were developing our Hurri-Cane reeds, I tried to obtain
samples of everything on the market to see what I could learn. Some products I
thought were amazingly good. I bought and tried Bari, Legere, Fibracell, and
Hartman. Did I miss any? Please let me know if I did!

            <pre class='message__body'>This is very much a matter of personal taste.  And some reeds work better
with some mouthpieces than with others.

I&#39;ve been quite pleased with the Hahn synthetic reeds - less buzzy and a
cleaner sound than Fibracells. Pricey, though.  And I don&#39;t need to be
reminded that I am going to Hell if I am not "saved", re the pamphlet
accompanying my last purchase of Hahn reeds.

Fibracells seem to have gone downhill. I used to like them, but in the past
few years I&#39;ve yet to purchase a new one that played really well, even with
careful adjustment.

Re the Bari reeds, I don&#39;t like them much either.

But recently I came across one that I bought about 25 yrs ago for baritone
sax.  I was about to toss it, because I don&#39;t have a baritone any more, but
instead I sanded its rails, and tried it on my tenor.  Wow! Easy blowing,
responsive, clean attack, and a big ballsy sound. Best reed I have right
now.

The reed had been sanded a bit by me in the past as well. I don&#39;t know what
the magic combination was - the past adjustment; aging 25 yrs; the different
profile?

Can any of those synthetics be adjusted - for example, with the Ridenour system?  Or do they shred into harmful Kevlar fibers or something?  I&#39;d be much more likely to spring for some Fibracells again if I knew I could balance it and adjust the hardness a little.

When we were developing our Hurri-Cane reeds, I tried to obtain samples of everything on the market to see what I could learn. Some products I thought were amazingly good. I bought and tried Bari, Legere, Fibracell, and Hartman. Did I miss any? Please let me know if I did!

 

I thought the Hartman carbon fiber reed was very nice, and that the Fibracell Premier series was a close second. I didn’t care much for the standard Fibracell, and pretty strongly disliked the Bari and the Legere.

 

We’ve sold a lot of our Hurri-Cane reeds, and are working to improve them. We think we have found the right material and keep tweaking the profile to get the response characteristics we want.

 

I’m quite interested in any opinions about synthetic reeds in general, and any particular brands I should be evaluating.

Legere and Bari can be trimmed with an ordinary reed trimmer.  You can also sand these reeds a bit to soften or recontour.

I don&#39;t know about Hahn.

Fibracell, absolutely not.  It will ruin trimmers and leave a mangled, unplayable tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>I trim Fibracell reeds with a Rigotti trimmer when needed. But it requires a
special method.

A sharp new trimmer may be necessary. I invested in a new Rigotti because my
older Cordier trimmer did not work on Fibracells.

Pinch the reed under the trimmer blade using the little lever to hold
everything in position, but don&#39;t force the lever, it can&#39;t make the cut.

I lay the trimmer plus reed flat on my bench, put a 3/8" steel rod against
the business end of the trimmer and give it a quick little whack with a
small hammer to make the cut. Works fine.

It does occasionally leave some small fibers uncut at the tip - they can be
trimmed manually with a small sharp scissors - although mostly they don&#39;t
seem to cause a problem.

After trimming,  the Fibracell reeds benefit from a bit of against-the-grain
smoothing at the tip to even out any irregularities left by the trimming.
This is what Tom Ridenour recommends after trimming cane reeds, and it also
applies to Fibracells.

Legere and Bari can be trimmed with an ordinary reed trimmer. You can also sand these reeds a bit to soften or recontour.

I don&#39;t know about Hahn.

Fibracell, absolutely not. It will ruin trimmers and leave a mangled, unplayable tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Bill,

Tom Ridenour developed a reed-finishing system using a special sanding block
and method of sanding.

He sells a kit with a DVD wherein he demonstrates his method, a piece of
thick glass to work on, his sanding block and extra sheets, and an
instructional booklet.  This for about $70.

A bit pricey, but it pays for itself. The method works very well,  is not
hard to learn, and should be part of basic woodwind instruction.

It&#39;s assumed you start off with your favorite reed brand - in other words,
the profile is such that at least some are good players for you. Tom&#39;s
method gets rid of minor imperfections that make a major difference in
playability.

After I bought his kit, I started working on a backlog of mediocre Fibracell
reeds I had kept (I always hoped I&#39;d figure out how to fix them, but was
stymied), and I was able to turn most of them into good players.

Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>Tom has lots of videos available on youtube.  It is unlikely you are already doing what he does.   His sanding block is bevelled at the edges and he only sands tip to butt end of the reed.  His testing side to side is common...but he checks it with little puffs of air.  In any case look at his videos.
