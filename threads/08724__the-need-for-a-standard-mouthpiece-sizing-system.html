different manufacturer, you get another answer.  This has got to be pretty
confusing to consumers who lack the equipment and knowledge of how to

I would propose that all of us in the mouthpiece manufacturing business
adopt a common standard, but am unsure as to what to propose to my peers in
the industry. I think that it goes without saying that tip openings are best
expressed in 1/1000ths of an inch (or millimeters, for those so inclined),
but should facing lengths and chamber sizes be included? If so, what is the
best way to express them so the configuration can be easily understood by
consumers?

 

I was always an admirer of the old Berg Larsen system. I knew right away the
tip opening (in 1/1000ths), chamber size (0,1,2,3), and facing length (M or
SMS). I would think that some variation of this would be very helpful.

 

I don&#39;t know if the industry has any interest in this sort of clarification,
but I am willing to ask. If nothing else, we might adopt it for our own
Saxgourmet brand. Any thoughts would be appreciated!

My 2 cents:

When I&#39;m talking with other players, we sometimes use the Otto Link numbers
as a reference for tenor and bari pieces - .005" increments with a tenor 7
at .100 and a bari 7 at .110.  Alto and soprano, I refer to actual tip
openings more.  I guess giving tip opening (in thousandths) and facing
length (in 1/2-mms) would be a simple, informative number system (.105  48).

BTW - are the Berg numbers actually chamber sizes, or different baffle
heights?  The "zeros" are so much brighter than the "twos" or "threes".

            <pre class='message__body'>Depends on how you define chamber and baffle when you have a piece with a superlong baffle like a Berg.  If you call the chamber what&#39;s under the window (and distinct from the throat), then for Bergs baffle heights ARE chamber sizes.

The only standardization that makes any sense for tip openings is standrd units (inches or mm), measured from the outside of the tip rail.  

FAcing length and schedule, chamber sizes, etc.  vary too much to standardize anything IMO.

Many people are just not good with numbers or measurements, at all.  The

I would think that a system that gives you the absolute values (rather than
undefined 7 vs 8) would be far simpler for consumers to understand. I think
most people are plenty smart enough to understand the difference between a
.105 and a .120.

 

We are trying to make the purchasing process more transparent. I dont know
of any other manufacturer who publishes multiple views of the mouthpiece so
you can compare the chamber, baffle, beak etc. like we do. Compare some web
sites and I think you will see what I mean. We also give a video tour
(albeit maybe not world class video, Steven Spielberg has nothing to fear
from us) of all our mouthpieces, which I also think is unique. We think the
consumer should make an informed decision if they are buying on the
internet.

 

Very few retail stores stock much of a selection of mouthpieces. I know it
is a hard decision for consumers to make, so we want to provide as much
information as possible. Providing mouthpieces to send out on trial would
force us to radically reconsider our pricing, so this is not an option for
us.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] The need for a standard mouthpiece sizing system

 


What is a 7*? If you ask one manufacturer, you get one answer, if you ask a
different manufacturer, you get another answer.  This has got to be pretty
confusing to consumers who lack the equipment and knowledge of how to
measure mouthpieces.

 

I would propose that all of us in the mouthpiece manufacturing business
adopt a common standard, but am unsure as to what to propose to my peers in
the industry. I think that it goes without saying that tip openings are best
expressed in 1/1000ths of an inch (or millimeters, for those so inclined),
but should facing lengths and chamber sizes be included? If so, what is the
best way to express them so the configuration can be easily understood by
consumers?

 

I was always an admirer of the old Berg Larsen system. I knew right away the
tip opening (in 1/1000ths), chamber size (0,1,2,3), and facing length (M or
SMS). I would think that some variation of this would be very helpful.

 

I dont know if the industry has any interest in this sort of clarification,
but I am willing to ask. If nothing else, we might adopt it for our own
Saxgourmet brand. Any thoughts would be appreciated!

            <pre class='message__body'>I mark mouthpieces with tip opening in inches, facing length from the glass gage (mm*2) and ellipse ratio.  I can regenerate the entire facing curve target from these 3 numbers.

I think measuring the tip opening from inside the tip rail makes more sense than outside the tip rail (the very tip).  But this will never be standardized.

It is impossible to classify baffle and chamber shapes across brands with a simple system.  There are too many complex variations.

Depends on how you define chamber and baffle when you have a piece with a superlong baffle like a Berg. If you call the chamber what&#39;s under the window (and distinct from the throat), then for Bergs baffle heights ARE chamber sizes.

The only standardization that makes any sense for tip openings is standrd units (inches or mm), measured from the outside of the tip rail. 

FAcing length and schedule, chamber sizes, etc. vary too much to standardize anything IMO.

It may not be a question of smarts, but of being in practice. I think many
people just don&#39;t do *any* kind of numerical quantitive thinking in their
day-to-day lives. If they did learn it in school (which is often not the
case), they&#39;ve forgotten. It&#39;s part of how we got into this economic mess.

It&#39;s surprising - but I find that some musicians have a hard time locating
tunes in fakebooks. I believe they just don&#39;t have a real solid notion of
alphabetical order - it&#39;s not at their fingertips.

I&#39;m not suggesting you adopt a different strategy. Times have changed. I
recall going down to E.U. Wurlitzer, and some years later to Mars music. It
certainly enabled me to rule out some mouthpieces right off the bat. And
yes, both those emporia are now gone.

However, have you considered a pass-around of some of your pieces?

  Barry:

  I would think that a system that gives you the absolute values (rather than undefined 7 vs 8) would be far simpler for consumers to understand. I think most people are plenty smart enough to understand the difference between a .105 and a .120.



  We are trying to make the purchasing process more transparent. I don&#39;t know of any other manufacturer who publishes multiple views of the mouthpiece so you can compare the chamber, baffle, beak etc. like we do. Compare some web sites and I think you will see what I mean. We also give a video tour (albeit maybe not world class video, Steven Spielberg has nothing to fear from us) of all our mouthpieces, which I also think is unique. We think the consumer should make an informed decision if they are buying on the internet.



  Very few retail stores stock much of a selection of mouthpieces. I know it is a hard decision for consumers to make, so we want to provide as much information as possible. Providing mouthpieces to send out on trial would force us to radically reconsider our pricing, so this is not an option for us.

  I&#39;d guess that the use of small simple numbers rather than measurements was an attempt at simplification so that a "moderate" facing opening would be a similar number whether one was talking abut soprano, alto, tenor, or baritone mouthpieces. The same situation exists with respect to reeds.

  Many people are just not good with numbers or measurements, at all.  The simple numbers are less intimidating.  

  Also, suppose a player likes the SuperMachismo Mouthpiece ® in a "5" facing, but decides he/she needs a bigger tip opening. Then why not just get the next number of the same mouthpiece?  This could be a way of subtly inducing brand loyalty via the line of least resistance - the alternative is that the consumer has to go find a mouthpiece chart etc. to figure out what the next size is (of course, tip facing is hardly the only determinant of how a piece will play).

  I also recall being totally ignorant about mouthpieces.  And I can&#39;t recall any of my early teachers giving me much information about mouthpieces - not until Jerry Bergonzi let me photocopy some booklets he had on the subject. 

  In the past at least it was possible to go try out different mouthpieces in the past to get some idea. It&#39;s more complicated now.

            <pre class='message__body'>We have a lot of people stop by our office and try mouthpieces, and are
always happy to have them. We also show and have our mouthpieces available
at all the trade shows we attend as well as all the seminars I teach and
other appearances I make. We sold a little less than a thousand mouthpieces
last year, so there is beginning to be a lot of our product floating around.
Since we have only been in the business (with our own original designs sold
under our own brand) since mid-2008, we think we have done very well. I know
you can look at our feedback on eBay (we maintain a store there) and see
what actual buyers think. We cannot, of course, control or influence the
feedback in any way.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree with Morgan. Chamber and baffle designs are too diverse to categorize usefully. But it sure would be nice (and kudos, Steve, for suggesting it) if there were some standardization to tip openings. 

I&#39;m totally pessimistic about the chances for a couple of reasons. First is the fact that manufacturers IMO are not going to adopt any system--rational and useful as it might be--that confuses their consumers. This would be especially true if you were trying to get a standardized set of numbers to
 represent tip openings. If an "old" Link 7 equaled a "new" Link 6 this would cause no end of problems. So the only possibility, I think, would be to get on neutral ground, using standard measurements in mm or inches (perish the thought that we would extend the use of the Imperial system, which,
 except for the US of A, would be rightfully dead and buried by now).

At worst, it would be very helpful, Steve, if you could persuade makers to at least provide a chart of tip openings relating numbers to a standard system of measurement. The makers could keep their fives and sixes and sevens, but at least consumers would have a way of finding out what those
 numbers really mean. Better would be to have the actual standard measurement printed on the box, if not stamped underneath the old number on the mpc itself.

Good luck,
Toby

 chamber sizes.
 
 The only standardization that makes any sense for tip openings is standrd units (inches or mm), measured from the outside of the tip rail.  
 
 FAcing length and schedule, chamber sizes, etc.  vary too much to standardize anything IMO.

I doubt many of the manufacturers would wish to cooperate....most of them
don&#39;t even show consumers pictures of the chamber and baffle on their
websites!

 

I&#39;ll figure out a way to do some sort of "pass around" program for some of
our products..it sounds reasonable enough. I know we can figure out a way to
make it work for us.

I agree with Morgan. Chamber and baffle designs are too diverse to
categorize usefully. But it sure would be nice (and kudos, Steve, for
suggesting it) if there were some standardization to tip openings. 

I&#39;m totally pessimistic about the chances for a couple of reasons. First is
the fact that manufacturers IMO are not going to adopt any system--rational
and useful as it might be--that confuses their consumers. This would be
especially true if you were trying to get a standardized set of numbers to
represent tip openings. If an "old" Link 7 equaled a "new" Link 6 this would
cause no end of problems. So the only possibility, I think, would be to get
on neutral ground, using standard measurements in mm or inches (perish the
thought that we would extend the use of the Imperial system, which, except
for the US of A, would be rightfully dead and buried by now).

At worst, it would be very helpful, Steve, if you could persuade makers to
at least provide a chart of tip openings relating numbers to a standard
system of measurement. The makers could keep their fives and sixes and
sevens, but at least consumers would have a way of finding out what those
numbers really mean. Better would be to have the actual standard measurement
printed on the box, if not stamped underneath the old number on the mpc
itself.

Good luck,
Toby

Depends on how you define chamber and baffle when you have a piece with a

The only standardization that makes any sense for tip openings is standrd
units (inches or mm), measured from the outside of the tip rail. 

FAcing length and schedule, chamber sizes, etc. vary too much to standardize
anything IMO.

            <pre class='message__body'>Categorizing baffles with a number is about the same as labeling the MP curve facing with a number at least there&#39;s some reference.  Through the help of the experts at this website, I found that using a graphical representation of the curves (based on measurements) to be the best starting point for comparing mouthpieces.  So why not try to represent the baffle in the same way?  Take a series of measurements starting at the center of the tip; then, at a standard set of distances from the tip (something easy like 2mm intervals).  At each interval measure the distance from the baffle to your glass gage. The first number would be the same as the tip opening.   You then would the have two sets of curve numbers one for the facing radius and the other, an internal "curve" (although sometimes there would be very little curve). I realize that there is more to the baffle than a simple cross sectional measurement but with my mind&#39;s eye I can more
 easily vision where baffle is or how far it extends.  I think this might be a bit more objective than to say something like....its just like a Ponzol only its more rounded bla bla bla.  I don&#39;t have very many MP&#39;s and am not spending hundred of $$ to buy until I can compare before I order (I won&#39;t talk of returning on this forum). Also, true enough that some of the best MP&#39;s are not in production any more.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to get a new MP to act as an old one unless I had the original in my hand.
 
Incidentally, I do like the pictures and videos of the mouthpieces....so very helpful. 
 
Again, my deepest thanks for the information present in this forum.

        Categorizing baffles with a number is about the same as labeling the MP curve facing with a number at least there&#39;s some reference.  Through the help of the experts at this website, I found that using a graphical representation of the curves (based on measurements) to be the best starting point for comparing mouthpieces.  So why not try to represent the baffle in the same way?  Take a series of measurements starting at the center of the tip; then, at a standard set of distances from the tip (something easy like 2mm intervals).  At each interval measure the distance from the baffle to your glass gage. The first number would be the same as the tip opening.   You then would the have two sets of curve numbers one for the facing radius and the other, an internal "curve" (although sometimes there would be very little curve). I realize that there is more to the baffle than a simple cross sectional measurement but with my mind&#39;s eye I can more easily vision where baffle is or how far it extends.  I think this might be a bit more objective than to say something like....its just like a Ponzol only its more rounded bla bla bla.  I don&#39;t have very many MP&#39;s and am not spending hundred of $$ to buy until I can compare before I order (I won&#39;t talk of returning on this forum). Also, true enough that some of the best MP&#39;s are not in production any more.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to get a new MP to act as an old one unless I had the original in my hand.

        Incidentally, I do like the pictures and videos of the mouthpieces....so very helpful. 

        Again, my deepest thanks for the information present in this forum.

          There is such a chart at www.saxgourmet. com  we’ve been providing this sort of information to the saxophone community absolutely free for many years



          I doubt many of the manufacturers would wish to cooperate……..most of them don’t even show consumers pictures of the chamber and baffle on their websites!



          I’ll figure out a way to do some sort of “pass around” program for some of our products….it sounds reasonable enough. I know we can figure out a way to make it work for us.

          I agree with Morgan. Chamber and baffle designs are too diverse to categorize usefully. But it sure would be nice (and kudos, Steve, for suggesting it) if there were some standardization to tip openings. 

          I&#39;m totally pessimistic about the chances for a couple of reasons. First is the fact that manufacturers IMO are not going to adopt any system--rational and useful as it might be--that confuses their consumers. This would be especially true if you were trying to get a standardized set of numbers to represent tip openings. If an "old" Link 7 equaled a "new" Link 6 this would cause no end of problems. So the only possibility, I think, would be to get on neutral ground, using standard measurements in mm or inches (perish the thought that we would extend the use of the Imperial system, which, except for the US of A, would be rightfully dead and buried by now).

          At worst, it would be very helpful, Steve, if you could persuade makers to at least provide a chart of tip openings relating numbers to a standard system of measurement. The makers could keep their fives and sixes and sevens, but at least consumers would have a way of finding out what those numbers really mean. Better would be to have the actual standard measurement printed on the box, if not stamped underneath the old number on the mpc itself.

          Good luck,

          Depends on how you define chamber and baffle when you have a piece with a superlong baffle like a Berg. If you call the chamber what&#39;s under the window (and distinct from the throat), then for Bergs baffle heights ARE chamber sizes.

          The only standardization that makes any sense for tip openings is standrd units (inches or mm), measured from the outside of the tip rail. 

          FAcing length and schedule, chamber sizes, etc. vary too much to standardize anything IMO.
