            <pre class='message__body'>Paul,

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one that was one piece but I might very well
have.  I assume if they were cast that they would be one piece.

The problem with consistency comes from quite a few variables, one is the
height of the table.  Since the forgings or castings are kind of rough, it
takes multiple passes with the facing machine ( I use a CNC machine) to get
an even surface on the table.  What this translates to is that the baffles
and chambers are higher or lower.  If you look at good older Links, you&#39;ll
see that the area around the u shaped part of the window is thinner and this
is not a result of it being filed up from the inside, it&#39;s a result of the
table being machined down.  Thus, the play more responsive and generally are
a little brighter than new Links.

Now, if you look at the new Links, you&#39;ll find that they&#39;re quite thick
there.  That&#39;s because when the blank is in the vise, there&#39;s a lot of
pressure on the table and it can crack so Babbit makes them heftier to avoid
waste.  I can&#39;t tell you how many pieces I waste because the crack at the
thin part of the window.

When, I was green behind the ears, I spent a lot of time speculating why
mouthpiece makers did this or that, now after twenty years at it and some
engineering classes, I realize that much of what goes into a product is
determined by 1) the manufacturing process, and 2) cost effectiveness.
Knowing this, when looking for a Link, look for the one that is thinner by
the u shaped part of the window BUT ultimately go for what plays the best.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah, I agree!  It is one thing to make one great mouthpiece... and
quite another to make 500 more just like it.

I would suppose you could say where the art enters in, is what the
manufacturer did in order to make the his product manufactureable, and
still retain the characteristics that the player wants to buy.  And for
any mfg that can do that, I have utmost respect.
