 But if you do want a milling machine (nevermind mouthpiece stuff, they're good for making stuff in general), for the price of a new Chinese toy (don't kid yourself, these are toys) you can get an old Bridgeport which will do a much much much better job of anything.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a small Atlas horizontal mill (and even an old Atlas metal shaper) for some processes.  The Bridgeport series 1 is very versatile old iron (2400lbs).  For even more stability (working with stainless) I&#39;d look at the old hor./vert. Van Norman #12 or #16s, Abene VHF-2 or 3, or smaller Deckel FP2 or Hardinge TM-UM.  If you want to convert to CNC, the consensus is, go with an older bench mill.  Funds unlimited - a 5 axis HAAS machining center is nice.
