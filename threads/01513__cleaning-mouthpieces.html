            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s my understanding that there are several people who have some 
concerns about cleaning mouthpieces.  I have two very good products 
to recommend.

The first product is sold at a number of pipe & tobacco shops.  It&#39;s 
called "Briar Pipe Wipes".  You spray this stuff on a Handi-Wipe and 
let the Handi-Wipe dry just a little before using.  Simply rub the 
area that you want to clean and it does a pretty good job.  (Then 
simply place the treated Handi-Wipe in a sealable sandwich bag for 
reuse.)  If you polish your HR mouthpieces with the towel regularly, 
you can almost completely eliminate the problem of oxidation.  

The second product I would like to recommend is a product called 
WENOL--it is a non-toxic, non-acidic German metal polish.  You&#39;ll 
probably need to make a trip to your nearest Harley motorcycle shop 
to find it.  It&#39;s worth the risk to make the trip.  A VERY TINY 
amount will do wonders--don&#39;t use too much, it&#39;s not necessary.  The 
product comes in either a Blue tube (pretty much a straight polish) 
and a Red tube (this contains polish and some VERY mild abrasives--it 
will not scratch--it&#39;s designed for tougher chores.)

I hope that this helps those who are suffering from a bad case of 
grunge.

            <pre class='message__body'>Soaking a mouthpiece in a solution of 90% water to 10% bleach, for just 
a few minutes, will kill even the AIDS virus.  Exercise common sense, 
don&#39;t splash this around, or get it on your clothes.  Rinse well with water.

            <pre class='message__body'>An alternative to the Wenol is Flitz, a similar and I think German-made product. I&#39;ve used it for years to polish metals as it&#39;s low-abrasive, and the combination of ingrediaents in both products cleans "crud" and oxidation from old hard rubber mouthpieces. I have a couple that are precious and I really baby, an old Cicero Kaspar and an even older Goldbeck. Meguiar&#39;s Car Care Products makes a line of polishes for a variety of finishes, and I think still make a polish/cleaner that&#39;s totally non-abrasive for avition and optical glass. It is great to use if you&#39;re afraid of damaging an old favorite.

Just DON&#39;T try what a repair-tech friend who&#39;s a tuba player did in front of me one day. He&#39;s an incredible repairman in every way and with anything, but a customer wanted the oxidation cleaned from and old hard rubber Brilhart mouthpiece. So my pal walks over to his buffing machine and does what he&#39;s used to doing to brass mouthpieces...buff it clean. Before I realized and stopped him he had buffed 75% of the logo off, and I explained the heat from the buffing might even warp the table or rails. He now uses the methods we&#39;re discussing here.
