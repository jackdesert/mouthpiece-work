            <pre class='message__body'>If the baffle, just behind the tip rail, is too low there will be 
resistance. 

Also, as you make the facing curve, as you near the tip, of you keep the 
same pressure, and lift the back of the mouthpiece too much, you end up 
with a "flip up" in the middle of the tip rail.  This can add a lot of 
resistance as you describe.  When you approach the end of the stroke, as 
you approach the tip rail, lessen pressure and stop lifting the back of 
the mouthpiece as soon as you see the tracks on the paper go from two 
lines (the side rails) to a solid smear of material on the paper, 
indicating the tip rail is being sanded.

            <pre class='message__body'>All good things to look for so far.

I have found that small irregularities on the facing curve will make a big
difference in how the piece responds.  Look how light reflects off the side
rails as you slowly tilt the piece in the light.  You will be able to see
if the tip has a large flip or if the side rails are faceted like a bunch
of flat sections with kinks between them.  The arc of the curve does not
need to be a perfect radius, but it does need to be smooth.  As the reed
tries to bend around kinks and flat spots, there are small leaks and the
response is poor.

For my work I minimize this problem by using additional feeler gauges in
the large gaps between the Erick Brand set.  I plot the facing curve on a
PC to illustrate where the irregularities are.  Still, a visual inspection
of the rails is needed to ensure they are smooth.
