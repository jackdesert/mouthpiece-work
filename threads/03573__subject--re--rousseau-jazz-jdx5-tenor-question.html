I don&#39;t own one of these but one of the local shops here has a Rousseau Jazz 
model that I&#39;ve tried on a few occasions. It&#39;s a larger tip opening then the 
5 you&#39;re asking about (9 maybe). Anyway, I own several pieces that measure 
around .110 and I found the Rousseau almost impossible to blow. He may have 
changed the design since then (this one has been sitting in the show case at 
the shop for 5 or 6 years now) but this one is a large round chambered, low 
baffle, "classical style" hard rubber mouthpiece with a big tip opening. My 
impression is that at the time the piece I tried was made Mr. Rousseau was 
under the impression that a jazz mouthpiece was just a classical mouthpiece 
with a larger tip opening- obviously there is more to it then that.

I&#39;d be interested to hear how you make out with the new one.

Keith
