            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Brice,

If you are just starting, read the archive of message posts.  You will need
to gather some basic tools and gauges.  If you are a little farther along,
let us know where you are at.

However, if you primary goal is a better mouthpiece for marching band, I
think you will get there quicker by trying out some factory made pieces.
