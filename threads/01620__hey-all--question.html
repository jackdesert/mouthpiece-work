            <pre class='message__body'>Hey, I just joined and Was inquiring about resurfacing mousepieces 
(Which I have started to learn just recently) for "Marching Band". 
I&#39;m currently a student and was looking to achieve the optimum level 
of projection, while still having good tone quality and a somewhat 
dark sound. if anyone can help me out with this, I can be contacted 
at Brice@....

Thanks, And By the way "Hi"

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Brice,

If you are just starting, read the archive of message posts.  You will need
to gather some basic tools and gauges.  If you are a little farther along,
let us know where you are at.

However, if you primary goal is a better mouthpiece for marching band, I
think you will get there quicker by trying out some factory made pieces.
