Do you know Cliff Pecota? if so he is pretty
welloutfitted with gear. He might be able able to help
you out with the machining, or another solution.

If not, drop me a line and I will try to dig out his
email for you.

I do find it interesting that your baritone Hawkins
piece is larger than the neck, I have just the
opposite situation with my metal tenor hawkins, have
to take the cork down very thin to get it to fit.
(that is on a Buffet SDA)
