            <pre class='message__body'>I just uploaded a scan of the brochure that came with a Vandoren V16 
T95 tenor mpc that I have on trial.  These are serial-numbered 
pieces, and the scan is a computer printout of the actual facing 
curve of mpc 65AM.  This mpc is a real player on my Super 20 tenor.

You may need to be a Yahoo member to see the full size image.  If you 
can see it, just right click on it and select "Save Picture As" (in 
English Windows).

In the upper right corner there is a link to the Full Size image.  Click on 
that, and after the image loads, then right-click on it and select Save 
As... to save it on your hard disk.

Or I can just send it to you directly.

            <pre class='message__body'>Mike - There is no photo attached to my copy of your e-mail.  I have at VD 
T45 (80AB) that I&#39;m very happy with, so I&#39;d love to see the brochure (I bought

Could you shoot to me directly?

Many thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>The image was uploaded to the Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site.  All can see it
if you visit the site and navigate to the Photos - Brochures area.  There
is a lot of good stuff on the site.
