            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys

If you have a mouthpiece that is just very good but you just need to take away a little brightness from it, do you go to the baffle and sand it a little?

Thanks

To what mouthpiece are you referring? Is it a high baffle piece?

First I suggest more conservative approaches: try some different reeds, as
some cuts are darker-sounding.

I also I find that some reed adjustments can darken a reed&#39;s sound. In
particular (I hope I can describe this accurately) doing some
against-the-grain work with a cushioned fine sanding block (i.e. as
advocated by Tom Ridenour) along the lateral parts of the reed on the base
1/2 - 2/3 of the reed vamp (resulting in a slightly more rounded
cross-section) darkens the sound of reeds a bit. This is an alternative to
clipping the reed, another strategy for an overly bright reed.

As far as sanding the baffle goes, I think it&#39;s worth mentioning that the
portion of the baffle just behind the tip rail is an area that I find is
very sensitive, and if a mouthpiece is playing well, I&#39;d hesitate to touch
this area.

I would take down the baffle a little right behind the tip rail.  The first 6 or 7 mm behind the tip rail has the most effect on brightness or edge.

Thanks for replying. I´ve tried several setups, several reeds and still feel it a little too bright. It´s a metal piece, high baffle one. I wouldn´t go to sand the baffle yet, until I am pretty sure. I don´t want to ruin the piece.
