            <pre class='message__body'>I just posted this on SOTW and thought it should be shared here too:

I use a 2-part black Acryllic I got from McMaster-Carr.  I clean out 
the area, file it some to roughen it up, and put a dovetail in it if 
I can (stainless is tough to do this in):  A "/______&#92;"  dovetail 
will hold the bite plate in better.

I put a piece of electrical tape on each side to act as a form.  
Level the bite plate area.  Mix the stuff and pour it in.  The 
Acrillic has a short working time (minutes) but takes 2-3 days to 
harden.  Overpour it and tap it to get bubbles to rise.  After it 
hardens, file it to shape, sand and polish.  If objectional bubble 
voids open up as you shape it, mix up some more and fill them in.

Epoxy materials will work too, especially if you plan to use a MP 
patch over them.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just did a bite plate on an old metal Brilhart, the pre Levelair model.

I&#39;ll post pictures.

The biteplate area measured .048" deep.  I looked around the house and 
found a suitable material in the cap of an aerosol can, black plastic, 
with the same approximate curvature, and a thickness of .040".  OK, 
.008" worth of thick CA glue will even things up pretty nicely!

I cleaned up the machined depression in the mouthpiece with a small wire 
brush wheel on my Dremel.  Shaped the plastic bite plate, and glued it in.

I actually made it a little wider than needed, then sanded the edge flush.

Pictures in the photo area.

I&#39;ve had to carefully grind some out with a Dremel tool.
