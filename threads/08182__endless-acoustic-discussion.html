            <pre class='message__body'>  I joined this group because I have an interest in developing my knowledge of the intricacies of the clarinet and saxophone mouthpiece. Over the last few weeks the site seems to be drifting off into subjects far removed from its stated purpose, and while this is interesting it is of little relevance to me. I&#39;d like to see the site return to its original subject area.

  I really think this group should return to the discussion of mouthpiece refacing and mouthpiece refacing only...of course, it&#39;s not my group, it&#39;s Keith&#39;s, but I don&#39;t think I am alone in wanting to return to the original stated purpose..I do think the discussion of acoustics is appropriate and interesting, so I set up another group for that specific purpose.

            <pre class='message__body'>As someone interested in the acoustics of the saxophone and other woodwinds, I fail to see how discussion about what the sound wave does once it leaves the mouthpiece detracts from this discussion group.

1) It in no way prevents those who want to discuss mouthpiece refacing techniques, tools, and strategies from starting threads on those topics or joining in the discussions of existing threads.

2) Those who are not interested in the acoustical theory involved in why woodwinds behave the way they do can certainly skip over those threads and read those of more interest to them.

3) In my view a discussion forum is like a buffet---take what you like and leave the rest.  It is that simple.

I established this group because I think this discussion is important and
quite interesting to me and I am sure many other people. I&#39;ve learned a lot
from you, Toby, and have a huge amount of respect for your postings.

 

I wanted the group to be specific and limited to the sort of discussions
that have been going on here. I think they are great, but need to be in
their own venue.

 1) It in no way prevents those who want to discuss mouthpiece refacing techniques, tools, and strategies from starting threads on those topics or joining in the discussions of existing threads.
 
 2) Those who are not interested in the acoustical theory involved in why woodwinds behave the way they do can certainly skip over those threads and read those of more interest to them.
 
 3) In my view a discussion forum is like a buffet---take what you like and leave the rest.  It is that simple.

The discussion seems to go on and on, with the participants seemingly unable to come to any useful conclusions, which makes one suspect they don&#39;t entirely understand what they are talking about . . .

forum regarding acoustics.  Since he was so gracious to invest his time to

many others benefit) and where your posts can be read by parties that are
specifically interested in the debate you are having, it seems to me to be a
more effective solution that doesn&#39;t inconvenience those of us who joined
the mouthpiece forum to talk specifically about the mouthpiece and learn
about the art of refacing.  Many of us have each post delivered to our inbox
as a matter of convenience.  I&#39;ve worn out my delete button on this
particular topic alone and frankly would rather have you shove a reed
splinter under my finger nail than to send another post on acoustics.

 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I appreciate your passion for the subject and am
thankful that there are people in this world like yourself that have an
understanding of such concepts and theories regarding wind instruments.
Your work will undoubtedly add value to the sax community that we can all
benefit from.  And for that I am thankful.

 

But please, I beg you, no more Ferron vs. Benade.  My head hurts.  ;-)

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: endless acoustic discussion

 

  

As someone interested in the acoustics of the saxophone and other woodwinds,
I fail to see how discussion about what the sound wave does once it leaves
the mouthpiece detracts from this discussion group.

1) It in no way prevents those who want to discuss mouthpiece refacing
techniques, tools, and strategies from starting threads on those topics or
joining in the discussions of existing threads.

2) Those who are not interested in the acoustical theory involved in why
woodwinds behave the way they do can certainly skip over those threads and
read those of more interest to them.

3) In my view a discussion forum is like a buffet---take what you like and
leave the rest. It is that simple.

As for me, I find this the most fascinating discussion regarding saxophones going at present. And if the discussion is somehow diminished by the discussants&#39; not building horns, then it would help if the folks building horns could set them straight. JT

This is difficult stuff, and not entirely straightforward, so "endless
discussion" can help to clarify just what we are dealing with. This
communication is valuable to those who are interested in these topics. I for
one do not understand why this is a problem. I think we average at most
three mails a day, as compared to the hundreds we all receive as spam. The
headers are generally clear, and it would seem easy enough for group members
to simply avoid reading messages on those topics if they are not interested.


 

Several interested parties do not communicate via SOTW, so that is not
really an option.

return to its original stated mission and scope.

 

I have established another forum to facilitate the discussion of acoustics.
I believe that topic to be important, but strongly believe it should be
confined to an appropriate venue. I do not believe general discussion forums
or usenet to be appropriate venues, which is why I established a specific
place for these discussions.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: endless acoustic discussion

 

  

As someone interested in the acoustics of the saxophone and other woodwinds,
I fail to see how discussion about what the sound wave does once it leaves
the mouthpiece detracts from this discussion group.

1) It in no way prevents those who want to discuss mouthpiece refacing
techniques, tools, and strategies from starting threads on those topics or
joining in the discussions of existing threads.

2) Those who are not interested in the acoustical theory involved in why
woodwinds behave the way they do can certainly skip over those threads and
read those of more interest to them.

3) In my view a discussion forum is like a buffet---take what you like and
leave the rest. It is that simple.

            <pre class='message__body'>Alternative site suggestions to continue acoustic discussions should be limited to sites that will welcome all the current participants.  I had previously suggested SOTW but I know understand that some of you are no longer allowed to participate there.  That is why I more recently suggested alt.music.saxophone.  

However, I am fine with allowing the acoustic posts to continue here.  I think they are easy enough to scan/read/delete.  Members can also configure their membership to download all the comments in a daily digest format so you only receive one Email a day with all the day&#39;s messages.  You may also be able to set up Email filters to send posts containing key words like "acoustic" or certain members names into a special folder or your trash folder.  Yahoo mail allows this.

Members should make their preferences known in the poll I set up yesterday.  I am not keeping count of votes made via forum posts.  As it stands now, the discussion on sax acoustics can continue.  If you have previously stated you do not like it, please stop repeating yourself.

            <pre class='message__body'>My observation is that there have been numerous posts containing nothing more than self-aggrandizement and promotion of one&#39;s products that have had less to do with mouthpiece design and refacing than the discussion of soundwave acoustics.  

It also seems a bit disingenuous to offer a discussion forum on saxophone acoustics claiming an interest in the topic, and then publicly claim that the moderator intends to cherry pick who can participate not based on an interest or knowledge of acoustics, but instead based upon past resentments.  This calls into question what the real motive for starting such a forum might be.

The woodwind acoustics discussion forum http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Woodwind_Acoustics  will be open to anyone who cares to participate.

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s not as if the discussion about acoustics is pushing out other more explicitly relevant topics.  There have been plenty of weeks with very little activity in this group.  IMO discussion about acoustics is preferable to no discussion at all.  Keeping this discussion in this diverse, moderate, and well moderated group is probably the best thing for it (the discussion).

The mechanical aspects of mouthpieces get along just fine with theoretical and applied acoustics in a working saxophone, and visa versa.  The problem, if there is one, is in our heads.
