Dear all.

    I am curious about maximum possible tip surface inclination 
value. Or the lower table end maximum elevation over a sand paper  
with approximate total table+facing length would work too.
    Another question is what is the maximum MP length possible 
through all popular clarinet and saxophones types from soprano to 
baritone. I am detailing input data for my fixture design excercises 
and would appreciate your help.

With best Regards
Dmitri

            <pre class='message__body'>I never looked at it this way, but I did some calculations for you.

A .110" tenor facing can have an 11 deg angle at the tip if it is radial,
15 deg if it is fairly elliptical, more if a flip tip is desired (seen in a
lot of Lakeys).

I doubt if anyone would want it, but a .160" tip tenor with a 24mm length
and an fairly ellitical facing would have a 34 deg angle.  I think even
Plas Johnson would want a longer facing and perhaps a radial curve.  This
would make it only 16 degs.

It is tough to find good facings over 26 mm long in tenors.  Air can leak
out the sides of the reed as you go longer.  Some of the RPCs tend to have
the longest facings out there (not including defective facings).  I suppose
up to 30 mm can be considered.  Even bari and bass are not generally longer
than the longest tenor facings.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have found that soprano facing lengths can run as short as15 mm, as 
long as 20 mm, with 16 mm being about average.  These are all as 
measured with the .0015" feeler.

Alto, I have seen as short as 16 mm, and as long as 25 mm, but 20 - 22 
mm seems average.

Tenor, from 19 mm to 26 mm, with 22-23 mm average.

Baritone Sax, from 22 mm - 28 mm, with 25-26 mm average.

Bass Sax, what works is 28 mm-31 mm facing length.

Generally the extremely wide tenor tip openings are accompanied by long 
facings, that is, you will generally not find a .140" tip opening with a 
21 mm facing length, but rather, probably 26 -27 mm.

There are more than a few manufacturers who have picked a certain radius 
of curve, and then simply moved where they begin the cut (from the tip 
of the mouthpiece) to vary the tip opening, such that you have small tip 
openings with short facing lengths, and wide tip openings with long 
facing lengths.

Thanks Keith, Paul.
Again my English failed me.
Words are in English, word order and word number from Russian.
Thanks for data given, I&#39;ll use them all.
The second question was about maximum possible length of mouthpiece 
to fit into a fixture holder, not about a facing length.
How long is the longest (or highest?)mouthpiece?

I think that&#39;s correct, but some bari pieces are quite long...Rico
Metalite is 5.5", Brilhart levelaire is 5.9", Lamberson bari pieces
are almost 6". I&#39;ve never had one here, but I&#39;m under the impression
that Runyon Quantum bari pieces are close to 6". Even a Link STM is
about 5.1".
