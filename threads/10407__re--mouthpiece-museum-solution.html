            <pre class='message__body'>Dear suffering:
I waited 5 minutes until it appeared the entire page and then save it as FULL PAGE (second option in Win XP sp3) Here I pass the interface in Iexplore (html) and the folder so that it can see.Â  Must unzip both the RAR or ZIP to the desktop and then run as usual.
Because they are unable to advise.
Happy New Year!

Thank you for everything I could learn and apply throughout all these years of friendship!</pre>
