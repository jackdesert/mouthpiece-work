            <pre class='message__body'>I doubt Rovner had a sound accoustic theory reason for doing it.  Just some trial and error work.  Some of Rovners designs feature a box-like chamber.  The longer window gave them access for a mill to get in there and machine this type of chamber.
 
Jody Jazz calls upon the mystical properties of DaVinci&#39;s Phi.  It is as good a reason as any to try something sorta different.

One other thought.  The Wyman paper has a small test where he undercut the window of an alto HR mouthpiece twice.  He tested it before, after cut #1 and after cut #2.  I think he concluded that the sound was "better" before the changes.  But this test was not as thorough as the other tests in his paper.  I think he said it would need further study to make some good conclusions.  I think so too since I find the sound "better" after undercutting.  Even on classical mouthpieces.  Perhaps there was a loss in resistance that he liked for classical playing.

By &#39;undercutting&#39;, are we talking about enlarging the chamber directly under the table, or making a deep depression in the table directly behind the window (forgot whose pieces I saw like this, maybe Claude Humber?)?

I&#39;m inclined to think this is the case.  It sounds like he found it harder to control, and a worse sound (whatever that means).  My experience, which (it sounds like) agrees with yours, and Ferron&#39;s reasoned argument for a shallow angle on the ramp, is that less material at the ramp is generally better.

One obvious thing relating to Ferron is that the ramp will be moved away from the tip considerably, so the effect of the wall at the end of the window may be mitigated.  It also compensates some for the chamber size related pitch issues high baffle pieces tend to have. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a great deal of practical value to really huge windows, except for the practicalities of getting a tool in there in the first place.

I moved ramp away for the same reason and it worked fine. Mmmmm it works very well indeed :)
Anyway there is an energy conversion near the tip area... I don&#39;t really belive to all those zig-zag patterns. But to be honest.... it works :)

  I&#39;ve been experimenting very, *very* simple mouthpiece designs - just sanding pieces of diagonally cut aluminium tubing (diameter more or less equal to that of alto/tenor sax reeds and 2mm wall thickness), and some PVC tubing to connect it to the bocal.
  Obviously, the window has a strange shape and gets ridiculously narrow at the tip.
  I didn&#39;t find it too resistant, but that might be because I&#39;m used to Selmer C* mouthpieces.
  I got a bright and unexpectedly loud sound. Low tones were quite troublesome, but I suspect that&#39;s due to my unaccountably poor facing job - I only had my eyes to check, no prior experience, and little time...

I&#39;m not replying to anyone in particular, just in general.

There is a huge misconception among players that bigger is better, whether in reference to the "bore", the chamber, the throat, or the window.

"It ain&#39;t necessarily so," says the song.  

If anyone believes that, I&#39;ll gladly hog out their favorite mouthpiece for them to try.  They will be greatly disappointed.

Some people pay me good money to fill in the chambers of their older Links.  When I&#39;m done, they have faster response, a more focused tone (rather than "spread" or "tubby"), and better intonation.

Just my opinion, but in years past I had ruined a number of good mouthpieces thinking bigger was better.

Well, that&#39;s partly where I got the idea, the other part being
http://www.geocities.com/tpe123/folkurban/clarinet/step4.html

I&#39;ve worked some more on my tenor sax mouthpiece, I can now actually use it, though low notes still tend to jump up when playing softly.

Both a fellow sax player and I tried it; I really liked the sound, and he said he was impressed by the result...
