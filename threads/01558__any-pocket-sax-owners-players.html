I am a sax player (though not a very active one), and I recently

Thanks in Advance,

Avery who responded personally to my post:

Hi Rev. (are you really a Rev?),

I just received my instrument yesterday, and was able to play a C
scale right out of the box.  It comes with a Rico 2 1/2 tenor reed,
attached to the instrument via a ligature.  Note, this is a one piece
instrument, and is not tunable by changing the length of the tube like
most "real" instruments.  However, the pitch bending via embouchure is
*extreme*.  Notes in the lower octave can be bent down a full minor
third!  A couple of initial comments:  

First, the mouthpiece has a significantly different feel from a
standard sax mouthpiece.  Where the profile of a sax mouthpiece is
"pointed", this one is more "blunt", which makes it feel kind of
strange in the mouth, but I think I&#39;ll get over it quickly.

If you&#39;re not used to an open-holed instrument, this will take some
getting used to.  The way the holes are cut makes it necessary to hold
the instrument in a very specific way, or the holes are not completely
covered.  This again will take some getting used to, but for me it&#39;s
not too bad, seeing as I am also a fifer, so I know how to cover holes
using the pads of my fingers.

The fingering is a little weird.  Most is as you&#39;d expect, but some
bizarre things are as follows:  The left thumb hole is not an octave
hole like a recorder, it is just the second hole on the instrument. 
The note "A", which on almost every wind instrument I know how to
play,  is obtained using the first 3 fingers of the left hand, so it
feels like a "G".  This is going to mess me up for a long time.

For a fingering chart for the instrument, see 
http://www.xaphoon.com/Fingeringchart.html
which also has a pdf version of the book that comes with the instrument.

The upper octave F# *does not exist* as a "real" fingering on this
instrument.  The only way to get this note is to bend the G down. 
This is probably the biggest flaw with the design, and I expect to
spend a great deal of time trying to figure out how to half-hole or
get used to bending so I can play in G, D and A (very common keys for
the type of music I like to play - folk/celtic).

These are just my initial impressions, mind you, and I expect to have
a better feel for the instrument within a couple of weeks.  

General assessment, it is indeed a real instrument, not a toy.  There
are a full two octaves, and I expect to get more by experimenting with
overtones.

I recommend buying one if you are brave, and have some time to climb
the learning curve.  I bought mine on ebay, using the "Buy Now"
option, from seller bellfountemusic for $40 plus $8 shipping.  If you
buy it from the manufacturer (at xaphoon.com) it will cost you $55
plus shipping.

Good luck!
-Chris

having a blast.  the low notes are great, but i&#39;m still working on the higher

on to buying an old c melody sax.
