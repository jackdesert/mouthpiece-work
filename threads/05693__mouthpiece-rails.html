Never hood of it.  What kind of material is it made of?  

Files and sandpaper wrapped around files is a good way to get started. 
Take a look at the photos on my site for some ideas.  Micro-Mark has some
inexpensive file sets but they will not last long on metal mouthpieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would strongly suggest not using a Dremel on rubber, since it is very easy on such soft material to make a small slip that will dig a big hole in it. Precision files are the only way to go IMO. You can also use small strips of fine grit sandpaper wrapped around a small (tiny) rod for fine work. 3M makes small sandpaper rolls with adhesive backing, but what I do is to cut a small piece of sandpaper, wrap it around a very fine brush handle and hold it in place. The paper clogs up quite quickly, so it is very easy just to move it slightly to fresh grit when that happens.

It is a rubber mouthpiece from France. Would files work on hard rubber? Is that the 
standard way that craftsmen work on the inside of the rails? Are there any alternatives to 
this such as the Dremil? I appreciate your help. Steven

Yes, a wide flat file is the tool to use here.  You can reshape the sides in just seconds.  Then sand lightly with 600 silicon carbide paper, then 800, then 1000.  Finally, after all mouthpiece work is done, as a last step, hand polish with a good grade of plastic polish.
   
  If it is a metal mouthpiece, start with 320 paper, and finish with some metal polish.  Then brush plate and polish the filed area to match.

I found a reasonably priced ($7.95) set of "riffler files" at
http://www.sciplus.com, item 10955.

These small files have a bend at the ends. Some are flat files with no teeth
on different edges, others are rounded and tapered at the tip. I find them
especially useful for fine adjustments near the tip of the mouthpiece, such
as thinning out the tip rail, and removing baffle just behind the tip rail.
Ok for rubber, plastic, brass, but I don&#39;t know about stainless steel

As Paul noted, file teeth get clogged. I found an inexpensive fine wire
brush that looks like a large black toothbrush in my local hardware store
that works well to clean files.

            <pre class='message__body'>I started out with several file sets from Micro-Mark.  They are economical
and you can learn what file shapes you like best.  If you use them on
metal, they will dull.  As they dull, you can buy replacement sets or
individual files.  

But I decided to get some Valititan needle files.  They are noted by the
yellow tang.  They cost ~8X more, but they last.  I like the half round,
barrette and square files.  http://www.ottofrei.com/store/home.php?cat&5

They also do not seem to load up as much.  I&#39;m not sure why, but the 0 and
00 cuts that I use rarely need to be cleaned with a file card.
