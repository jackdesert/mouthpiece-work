            <pre class='message__body'>I recently picked up a e.anello MR alto mouthpiece.  Medium facing, 
Regular lay.  I measured .065" inside the tip rail and 40.5 long on 
the facing length (21.25 mm).  The spec was .066" tip.

The rails were perfectly even.  There was a slight high spot to the 
curve at my .0095" feeler, but that may be a feature of the curve, 
not a defect.

It played well and had a good basic alto sound.  I compared it to my 
Nete PD67 which is suppose to be a Desmond Gregory copy.  The Nete 
was a little darker for me and a smaller sound.  I think this is 
mostly due to the small window opening on the Nete.

The Anello was most similar to the Babbitt HR Meyers I have.  The 
Anello actually has a little wider beak which is really comfortable 
in the mouth.  The inside was like the Meyers with a round chamber.  
Anello&#39;s was smoother inside.  No step where the backbore meets the 
chamber.  Just an indicator of the workmanship, not that important 
for sound.

The Meyer had a wider window and narrower side rails.  This gives the 
Meyer a little bigger sound.

Like I said, the Nete has a small window.  It also has rather thick 
side rails.  The chamber is quasi-rectanguler with curved corners.  
Angled some like a clarinet&#39;s chamber ("A" shaped).  I looked in my 
box-o-mouthpieces and found the Nete is very similar inside to the 
Vintage Bundy alto MP I have.  Its a shame the "Bundy" name is not 
well regarded among pros.  The old Bundy MPs make great blanks.  
Maybe we shoul buff the Bundy name off them.

I wont be holding on to this Anello long.  I got it just to check out 
his work and I&#39;m set with my other MPs.  They sell new for $85, so 
I&#39;m asking $40 for it, or a trade.

            <pre class='message__body'>Can you please let me know how much like a Meyer it is? A friend of 
mine (alto player) wants a smaller tip-gapped mouthpiece than his 
Meyer 4 (refaced to 85 thou tip gap), but similar in all other 
respects, and that sounds like it could be exactly what he&#39;s looking 
for.

Would you consider shipping it to Australia?

Also, it sounds like the Nete isn&#39;t a very good copy of the Desmond 
style Gregory... The Gregory model "A" 4A 18M has a rounded chamber, 
like Otto Links. They are very similar to a Link, but with (so I 
believe) a thinner beak. A friend of mine has a Gregory "Master" 5A 
20M that he was given by Paul Desmond, and this is just the same... 
No baffle, thin beak, rounded chamber. Certainly nothing like an "A" 
shaped chamber on the real thing (I assume it&#39;s a similar shape to 
the Yamaha student mouthpiece). I am led to believe that the Meyer is 
the closest thing there is (for a modern production mouthpiece) to 
the vintage Gregory mouthpieces, and looking at the one that my 
friend has, I can certainly see why.

Anyway, any info you have about it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Like I said, the Anello is like a modern Meyer 4 except the Window is 
not as large and the Anello was hand finished.  I do not want to open 
it up since it is made well and would be a good fit for a student or 
a classical/hard reed player.

A .085" tip would be a Meyer 8.  I have a Babbitt Meyer 8 blank that 
has no markings on it except the Meyer diamond with an 8 on the 
table.  The facing needs to be hand faced to complete it.  I would 
sell it for $80 US + s/h to Australia.

Sounds like it should be good for what he wants. Considering that he 
gets a "Desmond" type of sound with his Meyer, do you think he should 
get a similar sound with this mouthpiece?

> I do not want to open

If you did, he would be *very* disappointed - he wants a small tip 
gap (like the Meyer 4 is supposed to have).

He&#39;s currently a medium hard reed player, but he wants to be a hard 
reed player, as I am now that I&#39;ve got my new mouthpiece - I&#39;m trying 
out a Vandoren Java 3.5 (the La Voz hard is far too soft) but I 
wouldn&#39;t mind trying out a Vandoren 4... He&#39;s using Rico 3.5&#39;s at the 
moment with his current mouthpiece - as wide a tip gap for an alto as 
it has...

> A .085" tip would be a Meyer 8.

I know, and he knows it too. For some unknown reason it was sent to 
the USA to be worked on to make it a "better mouthpiece" (this is 
before he bought it with his horn), and it came back with an 85 thou 
tip gap instead of the 60-something(?) thou tip gap it was made with. 
He wants something like an un-touched Meyer 4 so that he can go onto 
some really hard reeds. He tried a Beuscher True-Lay 55-8??M (55 thou 
tip gap) and loved every minute of it (once he adjusted to it), but 
the owner of it wouldn&#39;t part with it. He&#39;s the one that told me 
to "go for it" when I found my beloved Beuscher True-Lay 60-937M... 

Do you have any idea of what the s/h charge would be to send the 
Anello to Australia?

Basically, as far as the tone we like is concerned, my friend and I 
are "birds of a feather". He&#39;s a staunch alto player, and only likes 
the tenor down low, where the alto doesn&#39;t have as much presence to 
it&#39;s tone - but when he heard me playing on my new mouthpiece with a 
hard reed, he told me that my tone was making hin seriously consider 
selling his alto, buying a tenor, and getting the same mouthpiece as 
I&#39;ve got. Needless to say, the Meyer 8 wouldn&#39;t be the one he would 
be interested in. However, when I told him about the Anello last 
night, his ears really pricked up.

Is the Anello still US$40 +s/h?

Thanks in advance.

            <pre class='message__body'>I mis-read your post about your friend&#39;s MP situation.  Now I 
understand he wants something like a Meyer 4.  This Anello MR would 
be a good fit.  I&#39;ll work on a s/h estimate and contact you via Email.
