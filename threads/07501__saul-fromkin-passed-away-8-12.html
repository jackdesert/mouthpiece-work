            <pre class='message__body'>I always considered Saul the greatest repairman who ever lived. He was a
fixture on the New York scene for many years. Roberto started as his
apprentice! Saul was QUITE a character, irrassible and outspoken. When he
was still in New York, his shop was always my first stop when visiting the
city. Saul had an instinctive knowledge of what made saxophones play well. I
learned a lot from him. After his retirement, he moved to Florida, and still
did a bit of repair. He and I stayed in touch, and he often gave me good
advice. I&#39;ll miss him. There will never be another one like him!

The Music Business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs. There&#39;s
also a negative side." Hunter S. Thompson
