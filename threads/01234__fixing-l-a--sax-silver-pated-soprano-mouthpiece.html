            <pre class='message__body'>Just received a nice-n-shiny silver plated L.A. Sax soprano 
mouthpiece with a #10 opening. Out of the box it plays much like a 
Dukoff D9. It had its problems: a bump on the right corner of the tip 
rail, a overly-concave table, a tip rail that was not very well 
defined, rough side rails. Since it played pretty well, I didn&#39;t want 
to get real drastic with it, so I just flattened the table a bit, 
smoothed the side rails and fixed the tip rail. It seems to play with 
a little less resistance, but the difference is hardly noticable.

One question: there are a couple of very small spots with bronze 
showing through the silver. Any reason why I should replate these 
spots? I&#39;m also thinking about opening up its square chamber just a 
bit since it plays flat from high C on up. This will leave quite a 
bit of bronze exposed.

Although I like the way this mouthpiece plays, it was not made very 
well. There were deep machining marks across the entire table and 
facing in addition to the problems mentioned above. It appears that 
they might be discontinued since they are absent from the L.A. Sax 
websight. Anybody know who actually manufactured these mouthpieces?

        The deep machining marks across the table and rails reminds me about the worst mouthpiece I have ever seen,
        a Wolfe Tayne baritone mouthpiece.  This mouthpiece also had a very short facing meeting the table
        with a sharp angle.  I had to remove a lot off metal to remove the machining marks. Afterwards I had it plated in silver,
        20 microns thick , at a lower than normal current density which leaves a harder layer of silver to last longer.

            <pre class='message__body'>You can spot plate by using the Brush Plating Process (see the Photos 
Section on the MP Work site).  But the plating is very thin and it 
does not hold up the the high wear of a reed beating on the rails.  
At least that&#39;s been my experiance.  But 80% or more will stay plated 
and this is usually enough to seal off the taste of brass.  

After re-plating, I have not had any green discoloration either, but 
to me that is not a major problem anyhow.  Green is a cool color. ;-)

The brass taste was a problem for me only after a 3-4 hr gig.  I 
could taste it for 2 days later.  It appears to not be a problem for 
most players playing on exposed brass pieces.  I hear virtually no 
complaints.

I think the LA Sax mouthpieces were copper, not bronze.  Pure copper is 
a fad now, mouthpieces, necks, bodies.  But copper is quite soft as 
compared to brass and bronze, which is why these alloys are used for 
saxes.  Still, some people seem to like what they hear or think they 
hear in copper products.

 

I don&#39;t know who made them for LA Sax.  LA Sax is sort of in a 
transitional state now.  Last year they were sold to Orpheus Music in 
San Antonio.  Former CEO Pete Lapaca is no longer involved, as far as I 
know.  Orpheus is Pearl Flutes, Vespro Saxes (the other colorful 
saxophones), and formerly imported B&S.   LASax inventory was being 
shipped to San Antonio from Barrington, IL, where LA Sax was located.   
So, exactly what will become of the LASax line, the accessories, and 
such, we will just have to wait and see.

            <pre class='message__body'>The mouthpieces were made for them in Taiwan. I’ve got the name of the
company somewhere, but it really doesn’t matter. They were a pretty
soft alloy, maybe all copper. Pete in not involved with LA Sax in any
way. They are still importing the B & S horns (now assembled in Mexico,
I’ve seen the boxes!) and selling them as the LA Sax Chicago series.
The other LA Sax horns are still made in Taiwan, and are finished in San
Antonio.

Subject: Re: [MouthpieceWork] Fixing L.A. Sax silver pated soprano
mouthpiece
 
Jon, if you want, go on and do your cleanup work, then send it to me to
have the silver touched up.   Contact me at tenorman1952@... or
tenorman@... and we will work out details.
I think the LA Sax mouthpieces were copper, not bronze.  Pure copper is
a fad now, mouthpieces, necks, bodies.  But copper is quite soft as
compared to brass and bronze, which is why these alloys are used for
saxes.  Still, some people seem to like what they hear or think they
hear in copper products.
I don’t know who made them for LA Sax.  LA Sax is sort of in a
transitional state now.  Last year they were sold to Orpheus Music in
San Antonio.  Former CEO Pete Lapaca is no longer involved, as far as I
know.  Orpheus is Pearl Flutes, Vespro Saxes (the other colorful
saxophones), and formerly imported B&S.   LASax inventory was being
shipped to San Antonio from Barrington, IL, where LA Sax was located.
So, exactly what will become of the LASax line, the accessories, and
such, we will just have to wait and see.

Just received a nice-n-shiny silver plated L.A. Sax soprano 
mouthpiece with a #10 opening. Out of the box it plays much like a 
Dukoff D9. It had its problems: a bump on the right corner of the tip 
rail, a overly-concave table, a tip rail that was not very well 
defined, rough side rails. Since it played pretty well, I didn&#39;t want 
to get real drastic with it, so I just flattened the table a bit, 
smoothed the side rails and fixed the tip rail. It seems to play with 
a little less resistance, but the difference is hardly noticable.

One question: there are a couple of very small spots with bronze 
showing through the silver. Any reason why I should replate these 
spots? I&#39;m also thinking about opening up its square chamber just a 
bit since it plays flat from high C on up. This will leave quite a 
bit of bronze exposed.

Although I like the way this mouthpiece plays, it was not made very 
well. There were deep machining marks across the entire table and 
facing in addition to the problems mentioned above. It appears that 
they might be discontinued since they are absent from the L.A. Sax 
websight. Anybody know who actually manufactured these mouthpieces?

Thanks,
Jon

Paul, thanks for the offer but I think I&#39;m going to leave it alone 
for now and see what happens. With the fixes I&#39;ve done, it plays 
great - just what I need to get around my Dukoff problems on soprano. 
If I have trouble down the road I&#39;ll consider replating it - I do 
have a plating kit but have never tried to plate a mouthpiece.

The box states that it is a bronze/silver mouthpiece so that&#39;s what I 
assumed it to be. It has a small, square chamber that I may enlarge a 
bit due to tuning problems. Too bad they so poorly finished.

the "Chicago" series of the B&S, Dave Guardalla(?),

David, thanks for jumping in here. After fixing the manufacturing 
defects on this piece, I can&#39;t put it down. A very nice design. I&#39;d 
love to try it in alto and tenor, but I&#39;m reluctant to drop that kind 
of money on them to the problems I had to fix with the soprano piece. 
I got the soprano piece for almost nothing because it squeeked so bad 
for the previous owner.

Any chance you will have more pieces with this design produced?

Thanks,
Jon

          I would only use spot plating on the table area , when the object is to prevent oxidation.   If areas on the rails lacks
          plating it is best to get the facing curve up to specification and replate.   I would not remove any silverplating  before
          replating if the curve is correct.  After applying about 20 microns of silver the Mouthpiece and curve can be lightly polished 
          by hand. Then the curve should be  checked.
          Make the plating company understand that NO BUFFING should be done at any stage.
          If the plating was done without buffing , at normal (or low) current density , with the correct size anode , the facing curve
          should need no work.

Thanks, Toby. That&#39;s what I was afraid of. Can these
little areas be spot-plated or do I need to take the
silver off the entire table and facing? I&#39;d surely
ruin the mouthpiece if I attempted that. I&#39;ve not had
great success at refacing recently.
