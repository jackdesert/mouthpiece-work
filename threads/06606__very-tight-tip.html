            <pre class='message__body'>The recent thread about a refacing quandry made me think of my old 
Buescher mp.  I got a 1927 True Tone tenor a year ago and it came with 
the original mp.  It&#39;s a #1 facing!  I measured it at .054".  I opened 
it up a little (.066) so that I could test the horn after a rebuild, 
but stopped because I thought that, maybe, there was some value to an 
extremely tight, extremely full chambered, extremely ancient 
mouthpiece.  Is there?  Should I go ahead and open it to where I like 
it?

>I don&#39;t think so Mark. My own experience was with a 20&#39;s alto &#39;piece
with a close tip, short lay and much hollowed interior and side walls.
I thought I would give it a much longer lay and more open tip - 79/866
for a big fat sound. It did not work for me and I managed to restore
it to 73/787. it now sports a roll over baffle but plays sweetly. I
don&#39;t think you can push vintage &#39;pieces too far beyond their original
design measurements.
I wonder what others think ?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I&#39;m a new poster on this list, but I&#39;ll throw in my 2 cents.  It all  
depends on whether you are wanting to keep it or sell it at some  
point.  Unmodified, these mouthpieces do have some value to  
saxophonists studying in the classical tradition of Sigurd Rascher.   
The majority of these folks play on Buescher horns with close, open  
chamber mouthpieces and very hard reeds.

Regards,
Walter Hoehn
