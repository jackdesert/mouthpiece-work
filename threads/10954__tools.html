I&#39;ve been "tweeking" baffles and interiors of my pieces for awhile now, and always left the opening/closing/tip work to the pros.  I have some piece though that I&#39;d like to try to experiment on, and woule like to know if there&#39;s a kit I could buy somewhere which would have basic measuring toold, sanding boards, etc...

all of the above you can get at someplace like Harbor Freight or any auto parts store.

the sandpaper I just lay on a granite cutting board, a mirror would be fine, too.  OK, using a lapping plate might be best, but this is flat enough for what we do.


For 90% of finishing/refacing work this is all I use.

There&#39;s a photo at &lt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/thepawproject/5537196940/>.

There&#39;s a thread on SOTW that may be a hoax  &lt;http://forum.saxontheweb.net/showthread.php?125153-Get-rid-of-the-feeler-gauges-and-glass-plates-forever>.

I watched Kalmen Opperman work on baffles many times.  He had a simple metal ruler about 3/8" x 6" that he stuck down the window to read the depth.  As I recall, Everett Matson used a short vernier caliper with a rod that slid out the far end.  Both used curved files, sometimes wrapped in sandpaper (grit out).  It&#39;s seat-of-the-pants work with frequent play-testing.
