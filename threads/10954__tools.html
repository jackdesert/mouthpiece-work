            <pre class='message__body'>Hi-

I&#39;ve been "tweeking" baffles and interiors of my pieces for awhile now, and always left the opening/closing/tip work to the pros.  I have some piece though that I&#39;d like to try to experiment on, and woule like to know if there&#39;s a kit I could buy somewhere which would have basic measuring toold, sanding boards, etc...   Or is it better to buy things one piece at a time?

Thanks, Bill S

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know where to get a glass gauge, is Theo still selling them?  That&#39;s the only purpose-built piece of equipment I use.  I also use:

Needle files 
feeler gauges 
digital calipers 
wet/dry sandpaper
0000 steel wool

all of the above you can get at someplace like Harbor Freight or any auto parts store.

the sandpaper I just lay on a granite cutting board, a mirror would be fine, too.  OK, using a lapping plate might be best, but this is flat enough for what we do.


For 90% of finishing/refacing work this is all I use. 

hope that helps

            <pre class='message__body'>You can print out one of the glass gauge templates from the "Files" section of the group, using inkjet stick-on transparency, and stick that on an appropriately sized piece of glass.  That&#39;s what I use, after dropping my Theo gauge.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ralph Morgan used to sell a kit, but it&#39;s long out of production.  It can be reconstructed from the list of materials at &lt;http://test.woodwind.org/oboe/BBoard/read.html?f=1&i!3665&t!3665>.

There&#39;s a photo at &lt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/thepawproject/5537196940/>.

There&#39;s a thread on SOTW that may be a hoax  &lt;http://forum.saxontheweb.net/showthread.php?125153-Get-rid-of-the-feeler-gauges-and-glass-plates-forever>.

I watched Kalmen Opperman work on baffles many times.  He had a simple metal ruler about 3/8" x 6" that he stuck down the window to read the depth.  As I recall, Everett Matson used a short vernier caliper with a rod that slid out the far end.  Both used curved files, sometimes wrapped in sandpaper (grit out).  It&#39;s seat-of-the-pants work with frequent play-testing.
