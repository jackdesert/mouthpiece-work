            <pre class='message__body'>I was wondering if anyone has tried to use a product by 
the Majestic Drug company called D.O.C Denture Repair? 
It looks like it maybe suitable for bite blate replacements.
I&#39;m not sure but I think its a white powder tht you mix with a 
hardner. It says its FDA approved for oral care.

            <pre class='message__body'>Note from Paul Coats--I just received this from one of my 
correspondents, a dentist himself:

Paul,
Thank you for your response.  I have over the years
gained a reputation for treating musicians and at
times their mouthpieces.  My most famous dental
patient is Maynard Ferguson, who had me mentioned in
an article of Windplayer Magazine. The most important
thing about using various resins is the leeching that
can sometimes occur and especially in the presence of
the oral cavity.  I use something that is made for
dental temporaries called Duralay.  It is a tooth
colored material and is considered a polycarbonate.  I
have used it numerous times and it can be polished to
a high lustre.  The old Dukoffs seemed to be ones that
I did most often and it was important to make sure the
old stuff was completely out, and usually it came out
in one piece. Thanks again for the information on the
Holton.  I traded a buddy of mine for dental work for
his wife.  He plays this horn and found mine on Ebay
and rebuilt the whole horn.  I play mostly tenor and
alto with a big band, but always wanted to just keep
the soprano around for quick warmups at home. Let me
know if I can be of any further help.
Best,
Mark
