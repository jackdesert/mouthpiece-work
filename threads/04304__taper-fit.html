            <pre class='message__body'>Charlie,

First of all, I&#39;d like to apologize for not acknowledging your
suggestion, earlier.  Second, I&#39;d like to thank you for offering, what
is, in my mind, another darn good idea!  I thought of using a drill
bit in a T-handle, starting small and working my way up in size. I
guess I would alternate between the "Letter" and the "Fractional"
sizes.  But I think my set of drills only goes up to .500". I realize
that I&#39;ll have to watch my depth, too!  The Yani&#39; mouthpiece only
needs to go on about       1 1/16" to be in tune. 

I really don&#39;t have access to a machine shop anymore, so I&#39;d have to
shop around for what I&#39;ll be needing to use, instead of making
something up, like you&#39;re used to doing.  

Thanks again,
Dan
