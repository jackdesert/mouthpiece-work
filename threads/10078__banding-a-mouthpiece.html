Does anyone have a source for a nice thin tubular stock to band a rubber Berg Bari piece. Ive been playing mine since 1970 and the shank wants to banded approx 1" ID I don&#39;t have a lathe here so I will have to take it down by hand so the closer to 1" the better. I only need 1 or 2 inches of it. The only stuff I found I would need to buy hundreds of feet of. Thanks for any suggestions. Keith fixed the tip on this one a few months back.

Another possibility is to install a carbon fiber band.

Ive been playing mine since 1970 and the shank wants to banded approx 1" ID    I don&#39;t have a lathe here so I will have to take it down by hand so the closer to 1" the better.  I only need 1 or 2 inches of it.  The only stuff I found I would need to buy hundreds of feet of.  Thanks for any suggestions.  Keith fixed the tip on this one a few months back.  I have played a  couple hundred Bari pieces.  This one is just perfect for me.  Thanks again  John Z

I&#39;ve been making bands from aluminum tubing, chucking up in my Microlux Mini-Lathe from Micromark (blatant advertising) and cutting down the outside, bringing to a nice near mirror finish, and boring the inside to needed dimensions.

Let me know L and ID needed.
