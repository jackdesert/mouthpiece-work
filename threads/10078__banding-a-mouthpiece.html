            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,
Another possibility is to install a carbon fiber band.
It is mixed with epoxy, the black color blends nicely with hard rubber, and is very strong.
Also, what I like is, it will adapt to all shapes and sizes.

I&#39;ve been making bands from aluminum tubing, chucking up in my Microlux Mini-Lathe from Micromark (blatant advertising) and cutting down the outside, bringing to a nice near mirror finish, and boring the inside to needed dimensions.

Let me know L and ID needed.
