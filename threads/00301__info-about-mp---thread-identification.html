            <pre class='message__body'>Hello, this is Giuseppe from England. I tried to find this 
information about MP Specs for a long time. I have to work a lot 
now... I will buy a good Kit. Paul Coat told me that the BEST kit is 
the one from Madison Enterprises, which is John Winslow. 

I have seen that on the Saxophone Journal, in the last years, there 
was a lot of information about the Mouthpiece Work. I visited the 
dornpub.com web site to buy all the back issues speaking about 
Mouthpieces, but it &#39;ll be too expensive. Do you know if  there is a 
Web Site where I could find all the Saxophone Journal&#39;s information 
about the Mouthpiece Work? Maybe could I find the same information 
buying the Ralph Morgan Mouthpiece Booklet? Wich books are avalaible?

I&#39;ve another question . I&#39;m looking for information about Thread 
Identification. There are a great number of thread in existance, many 
now obsolete but still to be found on older instruments and they 
differ in both profile and dimensions. 

I would like to be able to replace all instrument&#39;s rods and schrews, 
also on Vintage Saxophones. I don&#39;t know if this could be a question 
for the Mouthpiece Work&#39;s Group.Yahoo&#39; Groups are for me something 
new.  I would like to know which Taps and Dies to buy (more useful 
sizes and system: Metric - BSW - BA - American - etc.. )

That&#39;s all. Thanks,Giuseppe
