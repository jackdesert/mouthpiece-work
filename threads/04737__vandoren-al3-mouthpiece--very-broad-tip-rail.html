            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, I am new to this mouthpiece group, and have worked as a refacer for 
about6months.  I recently recieved a Vandoren al3 mouthpiece from a 
classical saxophone player for refacing. The tiprail  on this 
mouthpiece is very broad, nearby 2mm. The player has two more of this 
mouthpiece and the tiprail is the same on all of them. Does any of you 
out there know why this mothpc is designed this way? I got the mouthpc 
for refacing because of problems with the speed tongue technique, and 
wanted me to make it more responsive. My questione here is,can I make 
the tiprail slimmer without making the mouthpiece sound more bright? 
The mouthpiece has a stright baffel.I would be very happy if some of 
you more experienced refacers out there could give me some advice here
(sorry for my bad english,I am a norvegian, and I do not practice it so 
often) 
Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>I find that a radial facing is very free blowing on a clarinet.  Too free
blowing for normal classical tip openings.  But they come in handy for wide
tip openings for those that want them.  Like .072+  I have a client who
plays them in a Latin band.

            <pre class='message__body'>Jeff,

How does the facing measure?  I plan to start working on some more 
clarinet pieces soon, and while I&#39;ve noticed that my favorite pieces 
have a nearly flat section in the middle of the curve (with moderate tip 
openings around .045), Keith&#39;s recent post about very large tip (.072!!) 
clarinet pieces with radial curves has me intrigued.  Your Morgan is 
(conveniently for my purposes) right in between those two openings.

            <pre class='message__body'>I guess I wasn&#39;t clear. As long as the tip has an even, flat edge it doesn&#39;t need to be well defined at the back. What is important is that the area of the baffle just behind whatever is the tip rail drops away and leaves some room. I&#39;ve found taking material away directly behind the tip rail generally helps response--on sax mpcs. This is less of an issue probably with clarinet pieces, since they have lower baffles to begin with generally. Having a defined tip rail is a kind of insurance--a thinner tip rail wears faster, and if and when the tip starts to become uneven there will be no material behind it that might be left to allow the reed to beat properly.

I have just started playing a Morgan J7 clarinet piece that I bought
a while back...it is quite free-blowing and is duck-billed like a sax
mouthpiece with an alto-sized tip (.060).
jeff

There is always a lot more resistance on the clarinet, and at a certain 
point more breath pressure does not lead to more volume like it does on a 
sax. This is not to say that some clarinet mpcs are not more free-blowing 
than others, but for people used to the sax the clarinet will almost always 
seem stuffy and resistant. If you&#39;re interested I&#39;ve got the physics 
explanation somewhere, which I can dig up.

Toby-

If you&#39;ve got time, I&#39;d love to find out the physics about the
differences in saxophone and clarinet.  I&#39;ve had students ask me about
this and I just don&#39;t have as good of an answer as I&#39;d like.

I assume that the cylindircal vs conical bore has some effect but it
seems there must be more to it  than that.

Thanks in advance!

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Vandoren al3 mouthpiece, very broad tip rail</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>The clarinet or sax reed is driven by the air vibrating up and down the tube.  The reed is open during the time a pressure wave is going past the reed, and starting down the tube.  The reed closes as a negative pressure is left in the mouthpiece, and greater pressure is in the mouth.
   
  Then the wave bounces off the other end (bell or open tone hole) and comes back up.  As it hits the reed, the pressure equalizes with that in the mouth, and the springiness of the reed opens it again.
   
  The reed is closed for approximately 180 degrees, during the negative half of the cycle, and is open for approximately 180 degrees during the positive half of the cycle.
   
  Closed is closed, and for that portion of the waveform the natural fundamental and overtones are shaping the wave form.
   
  During the open portion, the reed actually attempts to follow the waveform, starting and stopping momentarily on its way open on on the way to closing, with the various overtones, both odd and even, of the saxophone tone.  
   
  The sax tone is quite complex, and has both even and odd overtones.  What this means is that they add up to produce a waveform that is "sawtooth" in shape, roughly, but have some wiggles and bumps on there as well.
   
  The clarinet produces only odd overtones, and its waveform is a "squarewave".  Like a buttress shape.  This is a rapidly rising wave that is more or less flat on top, and falls rapidly flat on bottom, rises rapidly, flat on top, etc.
   
  So, for the clarinet, the reed snaps fully open, and slaps closed, following the upper half of that square waveform.  And this is partly the reason some other facing shapes work well for the clarinet but not the saxophone.  
   
  The saxophone needs that nice radial curve so that the reed can smootly close and open and follow the various wiggles of the sax waveform.
   
  The clarinet can use a radial curve, but also there is a facing that is basically just an angle, a flat section out toward the tip, with a blended area at the break so that the reed can hinge smootly.  This works because of the clarinet waveform, and also the shorter facing, and much closer tip used by the clarinet.
   
  For the saxophone, when a narrow tip opening is used, along with a very hard reed (Rascher, Caravan, etc), there is only room for the reed to open and close.  Not much space for it to follow those other wiggles in the waveform.  This is why these type mouthpieces (long facing, narrow tip, hard reed) have a tone more akin to the clarinet... a higher percentage of odd overtones, at least for the half of the waveform where the reed is open.

            <pre class='message__body'>The sax reed actually starts and stops on its way to full open and as it is closing, corresponding to the overtones.  It does not smoothly open and close.
   
  The vibration of the air column IS the dominant cause of the tone, and the reed follows the vibrations of the air column.  But the resulting wave shape is far different between the two instruments.

          i&#39;m surprised to hear that the clarinet reed flaps, while a sax reed "waves."  How do we know that?

A sax has a conical bore like an oboe and can resonate at even as well as odd harmonics of the fundamental.  I thought that would be the dominant cause of a difference in sound and the coupling between the reed and the air columns above and below the cane.
