I had a very good night last night. I did some work on a couple of mouthpieces that was most satisfactory. I had been messing with an old white Brilhart 3*. I found the short facing very limiting and redid it to approximately a Link 6 or 6*. It was responsive but choked. Following the technique that had helped out my extensively worked Link STM NY, I removed quite a bit of material from immediately behind the tip rail. It went from an attractive but not especially useful mouthpiece to a definite player.

Your successful experiment Bill prompts me to ask the group for advice on my Chinese metal tenor MPC,  which I think is a Selmer type clone. 
I have levelled the table, reinstated the lay and narrowed the tip rail. This has effectively raised the wedge baffle, making the area immediately behind the tip slightly higher (0.001") than the tip itself.
It blows OK, but I feel that it might be improved with some material removed from this area, but have no idea by how much and where exactly.   
Should this be across the entire width of the tip area or as a &#39;dimple&#39; in the centre and what will be the resultant response ?

            <pre class='message__body'>A good time to take the baffle down behind the tip rail is just before or while you are working on shaping the tip rail width.  Doing it later, you risk messing up the tip rail.
 
My personal preference is to not use roll-over baflles with wedge baffles.  Both is just too much.  Add a pea-shooter throat and you have triple too much.  I&#39;m talkin&#39; Dukoff tenor and bari and similar MPs.  I keep the squeeze throats in half the Dukoff altos I work on and all the sops.  I advise the client what I think will work for their sound goals.
 
There are some photos on my site showing how much I take the baffle down on Dukoffs.  I shoot for a shape that looks like you depress the region behind the tip rail down with your thumb.  It is a flat region.   It make the sound less shrill and brittle.  It fattens up the highs and help to reduce chirps.  There is plenty of projection left over from the rest of the wedge baffle.  
 
If you can do it without messing up the tip rail, try taking off a little baffle at a time.  Unless you think the sound is really shrill.  Then be more agressive and flatten a region from the tip rail to about 1/2" away from it.

Hold the straight side of a reed, or a plastic straight edge up against the baffle, so it touches the tip rail.  You can then easily judge the degree of curvature and height (relative to the tip rail) of the first 1/4" of the baffle.  For a good roll-over baffle, the  surface should be just slightly curved (convex), dropping away from the tip.  Too curved, and there is resistance and stuffiness.  As you start to remove material, it gets better and better, opening up and blowing freer.  Too close to straight though, and the sound becomes brittle and harsh.  It should be even, from corner to corner. IMO.

 Thank you Keith & Lancelot for your helpful replies.
I will do as you say, with care and frequent test blowing.
I appreciate this site very much, for the insight and pleasure it has 
given me, on the technical aspects of mouthpieces. Thanks all.

You can then easily judge the degree of curvature and height (relative to the tip rail) of the first 1/4" of the baffle.  For a good roll-over baffle, the  surface should be just slightly curved (convex), dropping away from the tip.  Too curved, and there is resistance and stuffiness.

Ferron has some pics.  So does the Wyman thesis avialable in the Files - Literature section for download.

Does someone have a cut away side view of mouthpieces with the different style baffle shapes that they can post or send the URL for? It would help with 3-d picturing the depth of the shapes.

You can then easily judge the degree of curvature and height (relative to the tip rail) of the first 1/4" of the baffle. For a good roll-over baffle, the surface should be just slightly curved (convex), dropping away from the tip. Too curved, and there is resistance and stuffiness.
