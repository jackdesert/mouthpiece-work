We’re going to
shoot our often delayed mouthpiece refacing video next week. I’ve been
rehearsing over the weekend, and hopefully somebody can help us with a problem
we have encountered.

brass mouthpieces for our demonstrations. We need to darken the brass so when
we make a cut it shows up as a shiny surface. High contrast is important. I’ve

Today, for rehearsal purposes, the camera crew is my wife Sharon and my Sony camcorder….I think it’s important to be able to see where the actual cuts are made and material removed…..we had some gun blueing on hand (you learn to keep stuff like that here in New Orleans) and it worked OK. 
 
I know we will get better contrast and resolution with a professional camera, camera operator, and lighting. We’ll have all of those things present at the actual shoot.

Steve, 
Birchwood Casey makes a product called "brass black" that would work quite well for what your trying to do. It&#39;s usually sold near the gun bluing supplies.

I believe it&#39;s possible to put a patina on brass with sulfur.  I may be wrong though.

We’re using all brass mouthpieces for our demonstrations. We need to darken the brass so when we make a cut it shows up as a shiny surface. High contrast is important. I’ve been using gun blueing, which dries quickly and leaves a very thin coat. Maybe something else works better, and any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Why not simply use a Magic Marker?  When done, you can remove the marker with lacquer thinner.

  We&#39;re going to shoot our often delayed mouthpiece refacing video next week. I&#39;ve been rehearsing over the weekend, and hopefully somebody can help us with a problem we have encountered.



  We&#39;re using all brass mouthpieces for our demonstrations. We need to darken the brass so when we make a cut it shows up as a shiny surface. High contrast is important. I&#39;ve been using gun blueing, which dries quickly and leaves a very thin coat. Maybe something else works better, and any suggestions would be much appreciated.
