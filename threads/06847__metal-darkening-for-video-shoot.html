            <pre class='message__body'>My camera crew may have that available. Today, for rehearsal purposes, the camera crew is my wife Sharon and my Sony camcorder….I think it’s important to be able to see where the actual cuts are made and material removed…..we had some gun blueing on hand (you learn to keep stuff like that here in New Orleans) and it worked OK. 
 
I know we will get better contrast and resolution with a professional camera, camera operator, and lighting. We’ll have all of those things present at the actual shoot.

Why not simply use a Magic Marker?  When done, you can remove the marker with lacquer thinner.

            <pre class='message__body'>Jax makes a "Brass, Bronze, and Copper Darkener" used for putting a brown/black patina on arts and crafts style metal working.  If you set the brass piece in a little puddle, it turns very dark in a minute.  It can still be removed with a regular polish (or by sanding a mp face).  There are other brands of acid finishes, most of which can be shipped by common carrier.
