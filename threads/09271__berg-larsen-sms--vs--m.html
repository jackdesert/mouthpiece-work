Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Berg Larsen SMS vs M

  
Can anyone tell me the difference between Berg Larsen SMS & M lays.

Their literature states that the M is longer but this is only true for tenor and baritone and not alto and soprano, where the lays are the same length for both SMS & M models.

I gather that French cut reeds match the SMS & American cut reeds match the M . 

My main question is:-  Can anyone give the lay measurements for a Larsen clarinet or alto in both SMS and M versions of the same tip opening, so that I can relate to the differing curves.

The steel tenors I have come across had rounded tables and are a pain to work on. An alto version with a bent tip hammered flat no bother and finished up ok. 
>My own rubber clarinet &#39;piece made for me by Berg in the early sixties, has a flat table, though slightly concave across.
Stamped 60/0M it measures 57/669 and still plays great.
It has a radial curve with a slight flip tip.
>An equally old 50/2SMS I measured, had a definite flat at the 25 thou feeler, so I am wondering if this was the standard difference between M & SMS.
I believe modern Larsens are made in Belgium_______________________________
