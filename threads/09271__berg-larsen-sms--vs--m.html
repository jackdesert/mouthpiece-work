            <pre class='message__body'>Can anyone tell me the difference between Berg Larsen SMS & M lays.

Their literature states that the M is longer but this is only true for
tenor and baritone and not alto and soprano, where the lays are the same
length for both SMS & M models.

I gather that French cut reeds match the SMS & American cut reeds match
the M .

My main question is:-  Can anyone give the lay measurements for a Larsen
clarinet or alto in both SMS and M versions of the same tip opening, so
that I can relate to the differing curves.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have not been able to detect any variation between M and SMS facings.  Most Bergs have convex tables so the .0015" feeler measures way long on both facings.  Two Bergs marked the same will often measure more different than a M vs a SMS.  Maybe there was a time/era of Bergs where they were made better.  Like maybe the 60&#39;s HR Bergs.  But I do not see many of these.

I believe the older Bergs stamped SMS had a shorter, more pronounced  
curve.....of course, the company has changed hands many times, and I  
have not a clue what they are manufacturing today.

The steel tenors I have come across had rounded tables and are a pain to work on. An alto version with a bent tip hammered flat no bother and finished up ok. 
>My own rubber clarinet &#39;piece made for me by Berg in the early sixties, has a flat table, though slightly concave across.
Stamped 60/0M it measures 57/669 and still plays great.
It has a radial curve with a slight flip tip.
>An equally old 50/2SMS I measured, had a definite flat at the 25 thou feeler, so I am wondering if this was the standard difference between M & SMS.
I believe modern Larsens are made in Belgium_______________________________

            <pre class='message__body'>They are so inconsistent in both curve and table flatness I haven&#39;t been able to figure out what spec is for either, except that they&#39;re both too long.
