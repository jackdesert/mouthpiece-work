            <pre class='message__body'>I just wanted to say thank you for the help with the "Doorstop"  The piece was saved and turned out very nice.  It was especially gratifying in light of our recent loss of Bobby Dukoff.  I was pleased to be able to put one of his Hollywood pieces back into the world of music we all serve.

Thanks again and keep the dust flyin!

Phil
