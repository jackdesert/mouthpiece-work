Subject: Western Youth Hockey- Jr. Colonials

Hello,

I&#39;m contacting your organization on behalf of the Western Jr. Colonials youth hockey league.  

My son was introduced to your mouthpieces during a lacrosse camp at WestConn this summer.  It became his favorite mouthpiece.  Yesterday he purchased a new one at a hockey store in a rink.  We love your mouth pieces because they encourage our son to actually keep it in his mouth.  Refs are always looking for a reason to penalize players and always checking for their mouthpieces during the games.
I&#39;m also writing to you in hopes of a contribution for our annual parents night out and auction.  We have approximately 150 parents that attend our event in January.  It would be great exposure for your product and we would advertise your donation in all of our notices and brochures.  
Thank you in advance for your consideration in making a donation to our event,
Sincerely,


 Tina MacNevin
Western Fundraising Chairperson

Mojo- looks like they need some instruction regarding "face-offs"!  Bite down hard, and consider yourself fortunate to be recognized as a New Jersey "Devil".

I figured that the fact that they lied about having used your m/p and the manner in which they did it elevates this from a solicitation to a scam.

            <pre class='message__body'>I got a 2nd request.  I did some research and they did seem like a legit organization.  So I replied:

Hi Tina,
 
Your request still looks like a scam to me.  For one, there is no way "your son" has used one of our mouthpieces last summer... unless he plays saxophone.   Does the entire hockey team play saxophone?

--------------------------
...and they replied:

Subject: Re: 2nd request

Keith, 
I apologize, I got your email address off the internet.  My son uses flavored mouthpieces for lacrosse and hockey which clearly are not the ones you represent.  There is another company called MoJo.  I will contact them.
Again, sorry for the confusion!!!  
 Tina

---------------------------
Apparently the correct cmpany is called "MoGo".
