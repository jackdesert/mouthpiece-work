Regarding rails.

 

 

You can take from either side either by filing inside the mouthpiece (be
very careful near the tip) or by sanding and then polishing the outside. If
there is a lot of work to be done you might want to do a little work each
place. The issue is if it is not a little bit that needs to be done and you
do it all from the inside the reed will not want to work so good so take
into consideration how the reed looks on the mouthpiece.

 

There is a similar issue with the table when you flatten it. If the table
becomes wider than the reed that doesn&#39;t look right to a customer so in that
case you would have to sand the outside of the mouthpiece. 

 

Whatever you do don&#39;t sand the mouthpiece one side at a time. Cut a long
strip of sandpaper and run it over the front of the mouthpiece.
