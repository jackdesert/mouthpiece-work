            <pre class='message__body'>Is anyone aware of any commercially made table top pantographs (1 to 1)(also called a duplicator). I&#39;ve searched far and wide and haven&#39;t even seen any references to a machine like this. Before I think of constructing one, I&#39;m sending a shout out. 
A one to one table top pantograph would be ideal for duplicating someones favorite mouthpiece without having to go through the tedium of digitizing to cut on a CNC. 
 Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>Sears used to sell some kind of gizmo like this for a pin router to duplicate 
wood carvings.  I do not think it would work well at duplicating the entire 
geometry including the interior.

            <pre class='message__body'>Milescraft do a router pantograph, but I don’t think it would be accurate enough for a mouthpiece. Might be useful for making rough blanks.
