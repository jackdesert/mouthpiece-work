Is anyone aware of any commercially made table top pantographs (1 to 1)(also 
called a duplicator). I&#39;ve searched far and wide and haven&#39;t even seen any 
references to a machine like this. Before I think of constructing one, I&#39;m 
sending a shout out. 

A one to one table top pantograph would be ideal for duplicating someones 
favorite mouthpiece without having to go through the tedium of digitizing to cut 
on a CNC. 

Thanks,
Paul Spezio

Sears used to sell some kind of gizmo like this for a pin router to duplicate wood carvings.  I do not think it would work well at duplicating the entire geometry including the interior.
