Picked up a &#39;35 Aristocrat Tenor recently and put some pads in it. The old 
sax sounds great just like Bootman said it would. My neighbor [Ralph was at 
the sat thing with the Super Balanced Action Selmer] came over today and 
wailed a few scales on it along with some super altissimo. He said it was 
pretty good.

Along in the case was a Brilhart 3* very low serial # 11xx. Looks like it 
has stress cracks in the beak. It plays well but can the cracks be fixed or 
how does that effect the resale price. I&#39;ve seen some of those mpcs go for 
close to 100 bucks.

Also got an old Babbit with no number on it. These old HR mpcs can give the 
horn a real "reedy" sound.

What&#39;s new?

Bill

Its nice to have a vintage sax to play around with.  My straight Conn is
good for my jollies.

Stress cracks are not a concern for most players.  Collectors will avid
them if they can get a more pristine example.  Tooth gouges and open cracks
can be filled.  You would need to visit a Dentist to get a good color match
on the white.  Black is easier.

It is tough to judge the resale value of repaired and refaced pieces.  If
the refacer is well known and still active, I think refaces fetch about 50%
of the reface price on top of the value of the "blank".  If the
refacer/maker is no longer active, and their work is valued, they will
fetch high prices.  If the refacer is not known, the value added to the
piece is zip or it even lowers the value (potential hack job).

I&#39;ve been busy playing in the pit of high school shows.  My refacing work
is starting to pile up.  I guess that is a good problem, but I do not like
to keep players waiting.
