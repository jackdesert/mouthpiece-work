Forgive me, I only have experience working with clarinet mouthpieces,

are either gone or are worn away.  Can these be replaced?  What would

any work with metal facings, so I&#39;m not interested in these for facing 
work, etc.  Thanks for any information you can give me.

Hi Ben:

There are a few different styles of Brilhart metal mouthpieces. The 
Vintage levelaire has a molded rubber biteplate that is fixed to a 
right angle stainless steel mouthpiece. The best way to repair this 
model is to get a replacement and glue it on with epoxy.  

The Selmer marketed metal Brilharts are more of a traditional design. 
They can be repaired easily enough by removing the worn biteplate and 
thouroughly cleaning any adhesive.  Black delrin plastic sheets are 
available at hobby stores. A 1/16" sheet cut to replacement size then 
tested for fit and height. If the biteplate needs to be arched to 
fit, it may be heated so it will conform to the shape of the 
mouthpiece. You can sand or gently file the edges or underside to 
make a perfect fit then affix with epoxy. 

-Greg

Can you tell me where to get the replacement molded rubber biteplates?

Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>Bob, are these the Levelair models?  Satintone?  
   
  At one time Theo Wanne had some Levelair inserts.

  But if you must make them, get some inexpensive student mouthpieces, and using a bandsaw, or by hand, a razor saw, start trimming away what you don&#39;t need.  When you finally have the part shaped to your liking, and fitted well to the mouthpiece, polish it by sanding with progressively finer paper, from 800, to 1000, to 1200, to 1500.  Then polish to a shine with a good plastic polish.  I use Kit Scratch Out sold in auto supply stores.  This is intended for polishing plexiglass windshields on motorcycle helmets, and other plastics.
   
  Glue on with E6000 craft glue.
   
  In the File section of MouthpieceWork I have photos of how I made a bite plate for a famous player&#39;s Brilhart Satintone.
