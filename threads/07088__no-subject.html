            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been buying my sandpaper from Online Industrial Supply Co (it&#39;s  
MUCH cheaper when you don&#39;t buy from the hardware store).  They have  
silicon carbide paper in microgrits down to P3000.  That may seem a  
bit ridiculous given that most people on the list seem to use P320- 
P800, but I find the P3000 to be really nice for making a final finish  
without having to worry about removing too much material.

I&#39;ve tried finer papers but now never use anything finer than CAMI 600 on baffles and exteriors.  This is the same a FEPA P1200 or 15 micron.

http://www.jamarco.com/91b_Technical/sandpaper/Making%20Sense%20of%20Sandpaper%20-%20Page%202%20-%20Fine%20Woodworking.htm

I then use "0000" stainless steel which gives a fine but non-gloss finish.  I stop there most of the time.  If I want a gloss finish is use some polishing compound by hand and then some Flitz again by hand.  It is too easy to do damage with power buffing IMO.

            <pre class='message__body'>To remove scratches from baffles, tear a strip of 600 paper about 1/4" (6-7 mm)  and about 1" (25 mm) long.  Place it on the baffle and hold down lightly with your thumb.  Draw it out from under your thumb pretty much straight out.  Since the tip rail is angled down, you will be drawing out the paper without touching the tip rail itself.  

You will have to do this with several fresh strips of paper as the paper loads up quickly.  Then a few strokes with 800 paper, 1000, 1500.

For a final polish I make a tool from a 5/16" or 3/8" (7-8 mm) diameter wood dowel.  On the end I file a flat area and glue on a piece of 1/16" cork.  On the cork I glue a piece of chamois.  This is my polishing tool.

Then, with some Kit Scratch Out (or you could use Flitz, or other good polishing compound), I polish the baffle, again, being careful to not polish on the actual tip rail.

            <pre class='message__body'>In the past I&#39;ve used also 1500 and 2000 grade paper. Now I use 1200 too plus hand polishing on hard rubber and "dremel polishing" on harder materials. Anyway for people who like to experiment here it can be found sand paper graded up to 0.3 microns :)
