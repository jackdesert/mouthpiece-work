            <pre class='message__body'>I recently noted that My Guardala was approx 1mm out in the height of 
the rails near the tip. I have since balanced the rails and baffle ( 
very carefully on the latter). The piece is now nearly back to its 
former glory. It does not chirp any more as it used to on occassions. 
The lay now reads as follows>
0015     24mm
005      19.8
010      17
020      14
030      12
040      10
050      8
060      6.5
070      5
080      3.5
090      2
100      1
The 0015 is 24.5 on one side and 24 on the other. The rest are 
perfectly balanced.

Could anyone advise me on 1. is this curve OK or can it be improved?
Will fixing the difference at 0015 make the playability any better?
Thank you
regards
Ross McIntyre

            <pre class='message__body'>I finally got around to analyzing this curve.   I posted it in the 
Files - Tenor Sax area as RM_Guardala.  I put an elliptical curve of 
best fit through the points.  I think low note response would be 
improved if you lengthened the .005", .010" and .020" readings 
closer to my goal curve.
