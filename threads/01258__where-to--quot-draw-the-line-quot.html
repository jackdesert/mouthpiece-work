            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your reply. Your professional opinion is well taken. I 
guess I will go for the plunge. I find it strange that I have never 
considered it before. I have had classical training, and they all 
said it was baised on ohmbechure(sp??) then reed. Noone ever said, 
try a new mouthpiece. I did&#39;nt even concider it until I wanted to 
get a jazz style mouthpiece, then I opened up this whole saga. Is 
this the reason so many clarinetist sound so totally different?? 
I mean, when I play my clarinet with a recording of another, mine 
sounds good, but almost like a totally different instrument.

Would it be too much to ask for reference&#39;s on low end, moderate, 
and best of the best mouth pieces? Or refere a link. I saw your link 
for a book, but it would not open. I play classical clarinet mostly, 
but like to jam DIxie land and jazz as well. THanks for your help.

You may get some different opinions on a clarinet forum like Sneezy.com.

A good staple for clarinet mouthpieces are Vandorens.  These are fairly
inexpensive factory made pieces that have some hand finishing.  For jazz,
the 5JB is nice.  The B45/B46 are good for all-around playing.  If you have
only been playing stock mouthpiece, these may delight you.  They will be
more open so may need a softer reed.

There are a number of links to sites with hand made clarinet pieces.  Some
are available through the Woodwind & Brasswind for trials.  You could also
look on eBay for used pieces and get into buying and selling pieces as a
way to try them out.

            <pre class='message__body'>There is no best, or whatever.  And it all depends on what you really 
like, and more importantly, what allows you to get the job done with the 
least effort.  It is uncomfortable, to say the least, trying to play in 
a big band with a classical mouthpiece.  All those teachers that tell 
students, "Just use your C*&#39;s, you can play jazz on anything if you are 
good enough."  True, but it is a lot easier if you have the right 
equipment.  I have enough hurdles, without forcing volume through a 
classical mouthpiece.  On the other hand, it is very difficult to try to 
blend in the section with a loud rock and roll piece, too.  You have to 
find the piece that lets you just play the music and forget the 
equipment.  There is a very wide spectrum of tone colors in what is 
considered "jazz".

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Clarinet Mouthpiece Facings</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>This is an area I have only partially explored.  While I have found a 
radial arc to be the best basic sax mouthpiece facing, with only some 
minor variations fo special needs, I have observed more variation in 
good clarinet facings.

I think with a sax, there are more baffle and chamber designs to 
choose from to assist the player.  With clarinet, the good choices 
have more subtle differences.

Some clarinet facing curves are a radial arc, but not most of them.  
Many do gradually flatten at the tip.  Some call this shape 
parabolic, but that is the concept more than the exact mathematical 
shape.

Now here&#39;s a kicker.  Some of the best clarinet pieces I have played 
have 3 flat sections.  The table, the middle, and the tip.  There is 
a curved transition between each section.  I think this is called 
a "German" facing curve.  They offer additional resistance without 
going to short facings and open tips.  There is probaly some reason 
why this curve is good as compared to the different registers of the 
clarinet.

For some typical facing lengths and tip openings, go take a look at 
Ed Pillinger&#39;s site.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Clarinet Mouthpiece Facings</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>Peter and Keith, I got this from Tom Ridenour (who designed one of the 
Leblanc clarinets, and has his own mouthpiece line) about clarinet 
facings some time back:

Tom:  On the Yahoo Mouthpiece Workgroup, we were discussing that some clarinet facings are not a smooth arc of a circle, but rather, a series of flats blended together, one at the "break", a long flat, and another flat angle or a curve near the tip.
>
>Any insight or observations into this?
>

Paul
Yes, I&#39;ve thought about this quite a bit and I use these concepts in my own mouthpiece work.  Curves increase resistance.  The closer you get to a straight line the greater the resistance reduction. If I find a mouthpiece measures well but still if stuffy or resistant I begin by eliminating all the sharp breaks I can see; remember the sharp breaks are compressed curves, or curves par excellence, and therefore, create LOTS of resistance. Once I&#39;ve blended out the sharp breaks (if any) I then preceed to flaten the curve of the mouthpiece where the reed actually leaves the facing in performance. Making the curve less extreme between two points decreases resistance considerably. I like decreasing resistance that way because increasing window size to reduce resistance sometimes causes the tone to become spread and uncentered. Making subtle adjustments in the curve of the facing to reduce resistance, taking out sharp breaks and moderating the arcs of curves can accomplish the resistance reduction with a minimal loss of tonal center or definition in the shape.
That&#39;s my basic take on the matter.
best regards
Tom

            <pre class='message__body'>go to the woodwind section, then click on mouthpieces, then clarinet (or
maybe it&#39;s Bb Clarinet). 
All the brands are listed alphabetically in the left-hand column, so you can
just scroll down to Meyer, and click on it.

They have one Meyer model listed. (I was just looking the other day).

Subject: Re: [MouthpieceWork] Clarinet Mouthpiece Facings
 
Peter and Keith, I got this from Tom Ridenour (who designed one of the
Leblanc clarinets, and has his own mouthpiece line) about clarinet
facings some time back:



Tom:  On the Yahoo Mouthpiece Workgroup, we were discussing that some
clarinet facings are not a smooth arc of a circle, but rather, a series
of flats blended together, one at the "break", a long flat, and another
flat angle or a curve near the tip.

Yes, I&#39;ve thought about this quite a bit and I use these concepts in my
own mouthpiece work.  Curves increase resistance.  The closer you get to
a straight line the greater the resistance reduction. If I find a
mouthpiece measures well but still if stuffy or resistant I begin by
eliminating all the sharp breaks I can see; remember the sharp breaks
are compressed curves, or curves par excellence, and therefore, create
LOTS of resistance. Once I&#39;ve blended out the sharp breaks (if any) I
then preceed to flaten the curve of the mouthpiece where the reed
actually leaves the facing in performance. Making the curve less extreme
between two points decreases resistance considerably. I like decreasing
resistance that way because increasing window size to reduce resistance
sometimes causes the tone to become spread and uncentered. Making subtle
adjustments in the curve of the facing to reduce resistance, taking out
sharp breaks and moderating the arcs of curves can accomplish the resi
stance reduction with a minimal loss of tonal center or definition in
the shape.
That&#39;s my basic take on the matter.
best regards

This is an area I have only partially explored.  While I have found a 
radial arc to be the best basic sax mouthpiece facing, with only some 
minor variations fo special needs, I have observed more variation in 
good clarinet facings.

I think with a sax, there are more baffle and chamber designs to 
choose from to assist the player.  With clarinet, the good choices 
have more subtle differences.

Some clarinet facing curves are a radial arc, but not most of them.  
Many do gradually flatten at the tip.  Some call this shape 
parabolic, but that is the concept more than the exact mathematical 
shape.

Now here&#39;s a kicker.  Some of the best clarinet pieces I have played 
have 3 flat sections.  The table, the middle, and the tip.  There is 
a curved transition between each section.  I think this is called 
a "German" facing curve.  They offer additional resistance without 
going to short facings and open tips.  There is probaly some reason 
why this curve is good as compared to the different registers of the 
clarinet.

For some typical facing lengths and tip openings, go take a look at 
Ed Pillinger&#39;s site.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have 2 LC#3 here, one refaced by JVW and one standard unaltered model.
I will measure the Meyer 7L. No Berg Clar mpcs. I have a 5JB here that
isn&#39;t particularly wonderful, it is much softer, has less projection
than the LC#3&#39;s I favour.

I had a vintage Meyer clarinet MP that I sold on eBay a while back.  I

not think it was anything special.  My 5JB I was playing at the time was
much better.  The Meyer did not fetch a big price either.

Anyone have a Berg Larson clarinet piece???

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
I also play a Vando 5JB. I tried both Berg and Meyer as well as Pomarico a
couple of years ago. I chose the 5JB cause it&#39;s intonation was better than
Berg and Meyer, and projection better than Pomarico. I also have a Beechler
8L which has a lot of projection but a tricky intonation (actually, very
flexible and uncentered pitch), and a more "ethnic-like" tone.

How is it marked?  I have a local player here looking for one, but he
wanted one marked 100/2.  I think he just doesn&#39;t understand the convention
and thinks there is a clarinet piece that will match his tenor.

No, what I am saying is some of the N.O. Dixieland players are playing 
Meyer Clarinet with #6 tip opening and Soprano Sax reeds.

Don&#39;t think they have made these for some years.

I&#39;ll check with Rocky at Babbit.

Otto Link, Guy Hawkins, Babbit, and Wolfe Tayne.  (As a matter of

They no longer list Meyer clarinet.

I will see what info I can find in my archives on tip opening, etc.

        70 / 0  SMS .    Which make sense for a clarinet mouthpiece. Funny enough this piece has a partial bullet where baffle

>Yes I have a Berg Larsen clarinet piece.  

How is it marked?  I have a local player here looking for one, but he
wanted one marked 100/2.  I think he just doesn&#39;t understand the convention
and thinks there is a clarinet piece that will match his tenor.
