            <pre class='message__body'>Unbelievable! I take last day to show the manual to a friend and...
surprise!
A GOOD FELLAS stoles the pages regarding mouthpiece refacing and works
(pages 118 and following...)

That&#39;s book is perfect instrument for a student of sax, a simply view
sometimes helps more than words, and the E.Brand was ok for that.
So, friends of the blog I need help, where I can find files to
download this part only? I&#39;m not happy to order to Ferree another copy
just for some pages...

thanks.
Gian
