          You said "The mpc has a stop in the bore which allows it to go only so far onto the neck/cork...."
          Did you remove the reed and LOOKED into the chamber to see if the end of the neck really touch this "stop" ?
          Sometimes , as with my Selmer series II  the sax has a metal ring with a diameter to large for some mouthpieces.
          When you put on the mouthpiece it even feels as if it stops against a solid "stop" .    In this case one only need
          a correct reamer to remove material in the bore.
 
          If your MPC really stops with the throat aginst the ring on sax neck , you have problems.  
          In this case your options depends on 
            1. How well does the mouthpiece play  ( response and sound quality)  ?  If not great ....sell.
                
            2. How close to in tune is it  in the various registers ?   The intonation "pattern" will dictate your action.
                 If you tell us more we can give better advice.
        
            3. Is there a prominent throat which cause the "stop"  ?    No .. consider modifying. Yes .. removing a couple
                    of MM of the throat will change the character of the mouthpiece a lot.

            4. What experience + tools  do you have.

          
            We would like to know more to give you better advice.  Chamber size ?  Have it been tried on other soprano saxes ?
            Intonation pattern for low reg, mid reg and palm keys ?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thank you so much for your speedy reply Alf.

The more questions you ask me, the more I am convinced this mpc is poorly conceived.

The bore ends right where the lay starts, so there&#39;s no more room to ream.  As far as  "how well does the piece play"?  The answer to that is that because it plays so flat I couldn&#39;t really tell how good or bad it was.  The sound was a good warm sound with plenty of "pop", a good centered sound.  But, once again, I couldn&#39;t play it because I keep hearing how flat it is.  Because I had it pushed totally onto the cork, it naturally threw the scale off, so it didn&#39;t play in tune with itself.  The scale within the horn, on all the horns, were out of tune with itself, if you know what I mean. And yes, I played it on a number of very fine sopranos, it was totally consistent.

I thought that maybe there was a way to adjust the chamber/baffle/lay to bring the pitch up.  Since I paid ($325.) so much for the piece I thought I would try to find out if there was a way to fix it.  I sort of knew when I bought it 2 years ago that there was a problem.  And Gary was not cooperative in trying to help solve the problem.  So after hearing from you, I&#39;ll just go ahead and sell it on eBay.  Maybe someone else can make it work.  I&#39;ll attempt to sell it for $200....

In the meantime, am I the only one to have had bad experiences with Gary of "Sugal" fame?

Play-Doh, Poster hanging putty, dental wax, etc.  This would tend to fix
the intonation but the high notes will most likely still play flat.
