            <pre class='message__body'>Hi stimated Dan:
(please, sorry my poor english language, i only speak well spanish idiom.)
 
i have the presumption that many times the player not know to knowledge
what want or require; i will treat first to be believe to him that i had a retouche
to the mouthpiece and then that him prove it with different reeds possible.
 
To me this "placebo" produce results about some confuse player :)>
 
In the case of to have that retouche or facing, the best is become preparing
some solution to the non volume or flating toning can be one element how
the "enhanced neck" by Steve, because reduce the effective cubical volume
indoors the bore an have influence in the chamber. 
 
Dan, remember apply the theory of the "cone garble or cuted", whereby
the cubical volume of mouthpiece have to proportional to the cone missing.
Then, if we remov too much internal material, this can will found a inbalance or
toning inconsistencies.
 
I wait that you understand me.

            <pre class='message__body'>Compare the bass clar reed vamp to tenor reed vamps.  If the BC is shorter, you 
may need to use a shorter facing the 26mm.  Some tenor reeds can work at 27mm.

Larger tip openings increase the effective chamber volume. So does lowering the 
baffle.  If you then also make the chamber larger, the mouthpiece will play flat 
unless you can push it in farther.  I would try to talk him out of making the 
chamber larger beyond lowering the baffle.

I think this will be a dark, tubby, buzzy, unfocused mouthpiece that will 
promote a biting embouchure.

It is a common fallacy that a bigger changer is louder.  It is not.  What it is, it is out of tune and tubby sounding, no "focus" to the tone.

And yes, the real limit is the thickness of the tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Ah - I forgot about the "effective chamber volume" idea. So the physical
chamber volume decreases when you open the tip but, in the real world, part of
that "reed travel" region contributes to additional chamber volume.  
  
I agree with you and Paul and Silverio that there are often client
misperceptions about what the different parameters of the mouthpiece will do.
(e.g., lots of players come in with "I need a bigger tip opening because my
mouthpiece is too resistant - I need to move more air through it") This guy is
a serious player with very individual ideas about how to do things (like using
a 12* with bass clarinet reeds for a starter), so I'm trying to translate what
he's saying into a design that will work for him. If I did exactly what he's
asking for (.170 tip, no baffle, huge chamber), I have no doubt that we'd wind
up with an unfocused, resistant, tubby doorstop.  
  
I think a lot hinges on the exact plan and execution of the facing curve ("No
- really?") which is invisible to the player. So they ask us to change the
visible or easily understandable stuff like tip opening, baffle height/shape
and chamber.  
  
If he goes through with this, I'm thinking "Plan A" will be: measure his
current piece first, then do a radial facing (at about the same tip or a
little larger) and a 26mm facing length (depending on what the bass clarinet
reeds look like). Probably take down the baffle, depending on how high it is
after opening the tip.  
  
Thanks again for all your help, guys. Keep the advice coming - I'll let you
know if this project goes forward.

He's playing on bass clarinet reeds because his facing is not too good. A bass
clarinet facing is flatter than a tenor facing.

Hi all,
I&#39;m not a refacer, but a player who happens to have a lot of big tip mouthpieces. Some examples of my pieces with a big chamber and big tip that play quite easily are a Florida no USA 10*, STM NY 11, Florida USA 11* (all measure the correct tip size) and a modern metal Berg Larsen 150/2 (this one has a slightly smaller chamber then the Links). I also have a HR Tone Edge 10* and a metal new Vintage Tone Master 10* that are a bit dead in the upper register compared to the ones I mentioned earlier, but still they play not too bad.
So I don&#39;t agree with the general statement that extreme tips don&#39;t play well in combination with a big chamber. Ofcourse I agree that the request discussed in this thread doesn&#39;t seem very wise, but as refacer you can not do more then explain your concerns to the requester and let him decide if he want&#39;s to pay for a foolish request yes or no.
That sad I would like to thank the members of this group for the many very interesting and informative information I have seen coming along since I joined this group.
Peter.

Part of your job is to try to talk some sense into what is basically a person who is pipe dreaming.  This impractical foray into lala land is a waste of your time and his money. The only succesful extreme tip openings in my experience have had smaller chambers.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would get the biggest one you can but you&#39;ll probably end up having to bias cut the butt anyway to make it that big. Open as much as you can by sanding open the tip as well, you&#39;ll want the baffle.  I don&#39;t do bass clarinet reed facings on tenor pieces, but I have had good results with a standard Link curve with standard length (absolute length, not as measured from the last feeler) all the way up to .135".  Maybe start a little short of that and test with a bass clt reed.  With this idiosyncratic reed choice you&#39;ll probably have to finish the curve with your chops rather than with your eyes.  Or maybe talk him into using a reed designed for the instrument he&#39;s playing.  Don&#39;t mess with the chamber yet, unless when the client tests the piece it sounds like it needs opening.  With all that reed travel it&#39;s going to be too big anyway.

HTH,
Morgan

Maybe this is why there do not seem to be many opened up large chambered Goldbecks?

            <pre class='message__body'>This guy just wants a bulbous chamber with an open facing, and no baffle.  That&#39;s easy if you keep tabs on the mouthpiece&#39;s two  requirements at all times.  You don&#39;t have to do any missing cone measurements or calculations.  

1. Correct Volume:  Regardless of the pitch center (in relation to A=440), mouthpiece placement providing the longest overblown tube&#39;s (D1/D2 - just flick the register key) perfect octave indicates correct volume.  This is the starting point for play testing after each alteration (refacing, scraping, boring, filling, etc.), and must be maintained throughout.

2. Correct Mouthpiece Pitch (frs):  With #1 satisfied, the relationship of the shortest overblown tube&#39;s octave (C#2/C#3) indicates the mouthpiece&#39;s resonant frequency, which determines the upper register octave relationships and the overall pitch center.  Maintaining correct volume, one adjusts the mouthpiece frequency by manipulating the chamber shape - width/length.  

With an enlarged, bulbous chamber/open facing, you will need to play with the diameter of the mouthpiece throat and/or height of the baffle to get the right frequency - the perfect C#2/C#3 octave.  Changes in chamber length affect the pitch of the upper register about 6x more than the lower.  Changes in baffle height, even more than that.  Between the two, the correct upper register octave relationship and overall pitch center can be attained......for that particular saxophone/player.

            <pre class='message__body'>C#, the shortest overblown tube, is the note most affected by the resonance mode misalignment caused by incorrect mouthpiece volume,  which explains it&#39;s reputation.  It is also the most improved by correct mouthpiece matching.   The mouthpiece having too much or too little volume, at the player&#39;s normal embouchure, while still being playable, will often cause C# to be uncentered, unresponsive, and variable in pitch.

B2/B3 is more stable.  I use the B&#39;s as the primary indicator, and then fine tune the piece using C#&#39;s.
