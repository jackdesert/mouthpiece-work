            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------My first alto mouthpiece had a chip on the corner, like yours, and I was told
not to even play on it. Have you thought about seeing if it influences your
intonation, your tone, is the reed becoming damaged because the mouthpiece is
chipped. My advise is to at least take the mouthpiece and get a guy at a music
store. It might be fine, but if you havn't been playing very long then how
would you know if there's a problem or not?

            <pre class='message__body'>Is the chip large enough that it breaks through the tip rail or side rails
that the reed beats against?  It probably does, which causes an air leak
that is no good.

            <pre class='message__body'>If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it... er, so to speak...

It also wouldn&#39;t hurt to have a backup piece - you never know
when you&#39;re going to need it.

My $.02.
