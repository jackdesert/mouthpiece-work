            <pre class='message__body'>Lance (MartinMods) suggested that we defer to Keith&#39;s wishes and move the
modern vs. vintage discussion and the other non-mouthpiece discussions over
to my saxophone repair group on Yahoo. I welcome this sort of discussion
there, and invite the participants to join us there for non-mouthpiece
discussion.  The URL of this group is
http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SaxophoneRepair/

 

Saxophone Repair is a moderated group that I own. We have been at it since
April, 2004, and have 610 members. It&#39;s quite active, and if you have an
interest in saxophones, you may find the discussions interesting. There are
many members of the mouthpiecework group who are also active in our
saxophone repair group. Paul Coats assists me with moderation, and is the
official Saxophone Repair "hammer".

 

I try to be pretty flexible about what we allow on the saxophone repair
group, so long as it has to do with saxophones it&#39;s pretty much OK with me.
I have a zero tolerance for trolls, and this group is not a democracy. It&#39;s
quite active and keeps growing, so we must be doing something right!

The Music Business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic

also a negative side." Hunter S. Thompson
