            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,
I just changed reeds to fibracells on my own personally faced pieces 
and the alto sounds great but the tenor is wayyyyy off. Is there 
that much difference between real and plastic? My tenor mpc has 
the "flip-up" near the tip - could this be the culprit? I will face 
one using standard curve sans "flip" and test...

            <pre class='message__body'>Patrick:  All of my mouthpieces either have a smooth "arc of perfect 
circle" curve, or a slight flattening toward the tip.  Also, I use 
Fibracells with good results on all of my saxes, from soprano to bass.
