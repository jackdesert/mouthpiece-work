            <pre class='message__body'>I know this is a more (and by more I mean very) ignorant post, but I&#39;ll wing it. ;)

I have a Selmer Goldentone plastic mouthpiece I practiced for my first reface. My goal was to get the mouthpiece down to the minimums. Essentially, I wanted to make the chamber bigger, thin the rails, remove the baffle, basically anything that required removing material. For my next piece I tried adding, and this let me do quite a bit of practice. 

The Selmer Goldentone is a dud but it is finished beautifully in my opinion. Now I hate to say this, but the finishing in terms of evenness looks much better than not only some Babbit mouthpieces, but some mouthpieces hand made by people. (did I mention I was humble?)

To the point, I spent a lot of time on the piece and worked and undid and worked and undid over a period of about a week or two to make sure it was physically beautiful. When I look at it, the cleanliness to the work reminds me of those Aizen mouthpieces every seems to love. I was proud, until I slapped the reed on. 

When I buzz on just the mouthpiece I&#39;ll notice its very free blowing and clean, but there seems to be some gaps. I&#39;ll play for 4 seconds and then it stops, and then I reblow and similar results happen. I put it on the tenor and it plays some notes but nothing in the extreme like very low notes. I understand that this is no surprise because this piece was designed to, well, look good! Does anyone know what aspects could likely cause these problems? The chamber is medium by the way. Thin rails, no baffle, medium chamber, and unfortunately I did not use any meausuring tools and I don&#39;t have any so I don&#39;t know the tip. If it is the tip, would you guess to small or too big (I would guess small) and how would I make it bigger?

            <pre class='message__body'>From jimmitch >>>You need a good refacing kit .Check the links for them.If you are not going to measure then you will need to play test many times as you are working on the piece.I never cared much about the look of a mouthpiece. I only care that it plays great.

            <pre class='message__body'>Call me cheap, but I don&#39;t like buying those overpriced little vinyl patches
that (for me) don&#39;t last very long, and that I can only get by mail order.

So far I&#39;ve found 2 inexpensive substitutes that work pretty well.

1. 3/4" Dymo label tape - makes a durable patch with a hard surface.  I
think a roll was about $17 w. shipping, and has to be good for a few hundred
patches. 
2. The scotch tape for gift wrapping - comes in a little block 3/4" x 2" - I
cut each block in half and trim with a razor blade to shape and then peel
off 2-3 layers at a time  for a softer mouthpiece patch.


Any other good solutions out there?
Tire patch kits any good?

Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>Hal> I like to make them out of bike tubes.  I trace the beak with a wax 
pencil.  Then I cut it out.  I don&#39;t want a 90 degree angle. It takes a 
sharp pair of scissors.  You hold them flat while cutting.  This makes 
the cut closer to a 45 degree angle.
