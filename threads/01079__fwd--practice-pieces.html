            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ll take half of them if you can send them to me ! (I won&#39;t be greedy!) Private email me for my address. I will compensate you for shipping.
 
At present, I am practicing on plastic and hard rubber alto sax and tenor sax mouthpieces. Smaller mouthpieces such as clarinet and soprano saxophone are (at this time) wasted on me. The smaller the piece, the easier it is to mess up.
 
Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>My 1st piece was a clarinet piece.  But I found my 2nd, a bari sax 
piece, much easier to learn on.

Mike (LBAjazz) asked that he be contacted by Email.  He may not be a 
current member or a regular MPWork reader.

            <pre class='message__body'>I can use about 5-6 tenor or alto mouthpieces. I responded to the board and Keith pointed out that you wanted to be contacted by email.
 
Please write back if you still have the mpcs.
