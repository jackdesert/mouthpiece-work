            <pre class='message__body'>I have just bought a babbit-kit for refacing. And started to measure out a lot of mouthpieces from the shop I work in, in Stockholm. Is there someone who can explain this to me with some personal help? Via mail or something like that. I´ve been reading every instruction many times and now I&#39;m starting to wonder if I measure the right stuff. I´ve read the erick brand guide and started to read the Wyman-book. Hope someone can help me to get started with the use of speadsheet. Thank you!

            <pre class='message__body'>Make sure you make use of all the info posted on the Mouthpiece Work Yahoo site.  It is tedious to read through years of messages, but there are many answers in there.  There are a few posts that have step-by-step instructions.  The Files and Links sections have a lot of info too.

If you are not a spreadsheet user, you may need to take some tutorials on how to do basic spreadsheet tasks.  Havin a local friend show you the basics is often better and they may even be able to show you how to use the facing curve spreadsheets even though they know nothing about mouthpiece facing.  If they are good at spreadsheets in general, they will easily be able to determine where the inputs and outputs of the calculations are.

If you have some specific questions, go ahead and ask them.
