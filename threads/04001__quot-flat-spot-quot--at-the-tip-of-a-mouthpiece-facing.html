            <pre class='message__body'>I have been a member of this group for quite some time but I have not  posted 
until I took some time to read the extensive list of previous posts. 
 
I have watched several great refacers work on my mouthpieces.  These  people 
include Ben Harrod (Otto Link Pompano Beach), Wolfie Tannebaum (Wolfe  Tayne, 
Guy Hawkins and BARI), Bobby Dukoff, Ralph Morgan, Bennie Bonacio, and  Frank 
Wells.  To a greater or lesser extent, these refacers and  manufacturers use a 
flat  spot near the tip of their facing curves.  I  have not seen this 
tendency discussed to any great extent here.
 
The Erick Brand refacing manual mentions that many good mouthpiece  facings 
are nearly flat from the tip back to the first or even second  feeler gauge.  
Frank Wells, famous for his work for John Coltrane, Eric  Dolphy, Bobby Mintzer 
Mike Smith and too many others to mention here, was a  serious exponent of 
this technique.  Frank would finish his facing  curve with a SIDEWAYS sweep of 
the tip across his sandpaper.  The  angle of the mouthpiece, of course, would 
determine the length of this "flat  spot."
 
From the experienced refacers here, what is your experience with this  
technique?  What results does it yield for you?  What part of the  range of the 
instrument is most affected? How do you go about producing your tip  curve.  
Please - I&#39;m looking for empirical results, not armchair  theory.

I&#39;m no great expert or authority but my own experience is that a flat
section near the tip gives added brightness to the sound.  Downside
would be slightly more resistance.  Also the palm key notes become
slightly thinner and less rounded.  I found this out from an Otto Link
SUper Tonemaster I bought new which had a suprisingly bright tone, but
rather thin and difficult to control in the high notes, altissimo
impossible.  After I refaced to a complete radial curve it was darker,
but altissimo was restored.

A moderator of this forum?  Just Paul Coats and I have that status, and it
was not me.

I find the perfectly flat tip has very poor altissimo response in a sax
mouthpiece.  It can also sound edgy.  I have some theories why this is
true.  My chair does not have arms.

Surely, the missing part of the equation is the reed. 
A flat tip will match a flat cut American reed and a curved (hollow)
tip will accomodate a French cut reed with its raised heart being
pressed downwards in the centre, to match a curved tip on the mouthpiece.
Just my thoughts.

            <pre class='message__body'>You need to have a flat spot at the tip if you want the reed tip to seal across the curved tip rail all at the same time. If you continue the curve to the very end the middle of the tip rail, being further out than the edges of the tip rail, will be higher, and therefore the reed tip in the center will not seal at the same time as the edges.

            <pre class='message__body'>Obviously from the tip rail edges to the center of the tip rail *has* to be flat. In my own experience this gives easier response and--especially with a high baffle just behind the tip rail or a rollover--less tendency to chirp. However I don&#39;t have all that much experience, so it would be good to hear from others who do this more regularly.

  So, the $64,000 question is: what is the length, relative to facing 
  length, of the flat spot?  I suspect this is a trial and error thing.
