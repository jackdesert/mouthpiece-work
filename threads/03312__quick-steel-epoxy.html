            <pre class='message__body'>I hope this stuff stays put.  Its great to work with.  I had a mpc that 
had a case of the tubbies. I coated the floor and procceded to file it 
once it was cured.  It was a treat to be working on a metal mouthpiece 
with material that acted like hard rubber.  The mpc has a nice kick to 
it without using a protruding baffle as I dont really like the overall 
effect of those...at least none I create.

It&#39;ll stay put with anything short of a blowtorch if the surface was clean 
;-)
