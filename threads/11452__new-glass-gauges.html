            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Guys-- 
 A couple months ago I broke my last LAW glass gauge. They were great because the lines were tapered the same as most mouthpiece windows making it much easier to align than the old Babbitt or Morgan style with two lines in the center. I've made one to replace it, but to do it really well I'll need to buy some precision ground glass to make sure the angles are all right (I always preferred the gauge to go to the edge, rather than the offset style).  It makes more sense to get many of these, which means many more blanks than I will ever need, So I thought if some of you need/want another gauge or two,  .
 

 So, is there any interest in a gauge like this?  They would be £20 + shipping from England.  Also considering making them from borosilicate (Pyrex) glass, which is more scratch resistant but may be overkill  and would cost an additonal £8 per.
 

 cheers
 Morgan
