            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Reed motion.</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>There is some description, I think, in the Art Of Saxophone Playing,
Larry Teal, and some in The Saxophone Is My Voice, Ernest Ferron.

This has been photographed.  To explain further, the reed stays closed
against the facing appx 180^ of the cycle, which is when the compression
wave is moving down the tube toward the other end.  This leaves a low
pressure behind, in the mouthpiece and neck, while the pressure is still
high (or constant) in the mouth.  So, the reed slams shut on the facing.

Then the high pressure portion of the wave hits the bell, or open tone
hole, bounces back, and eventually comes back to the mouthpiece.  The
pressure is now equal, or nearly so, to the pressure inside the mouth,
so the reed can spring open, trying to straighten out.

BUT, there are multiple waves happening, along with the fundamental, and
each of these affect the pressure, making the reed open in a jerky
fashion, not smoothly swinging open, like opening a door, but stuttering
open.  It then remains fully open for a period of time, and then jerks
shut again.
