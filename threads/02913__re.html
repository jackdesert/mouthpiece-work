            <pre class='message__body'>Paul, As was suggested I did measure the facing and found it to be short. I sold the piece which was untouched instead of taking a chance on not correcting the problem and having lowered the value of the piece by having it altered. I&#39;m new at this art. Thanks, Doug...

  Is this a "*" facing?  (4*, 5*, etc).  The * facings are very short and difficult in the low register.  Lengthen the facing and they are quite nice.
