            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve posted 2 photos of my version of this, having been inspired by someone else&#39;s DIY bassoon reed profiler (posted earlier)

I ground a flat onto the pipe for the reeds to rest on, and since it was not as accurate as I would have preferred, glued on a strip of sheet plastic. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m totally satisfied with the clips (springy stainless steel from an auto hose clamp) but they seem adequate.

Unfortunately, I cannot report results yet, as the first thing that happened when testing the profiler, was that it fried the transformer in what I thought was a pretty robust 18V power supply (home-brew, so it had no ratings). The motor and chuck are from a cheap 18V cordless drill with a dead battery pack. 

Hopefully this will get "close enough for jazz" when copying reeds, such that further finishing will be less time-consuming.

I don&#39;t consider this quite off-topic, as it&#39;s possible to spend an inordinate amount of time getting a reed to play well with any particular mouthpiece. I&#39;d be very happy if my own mouthpieces were more "reed-friendly", but that&#39;s not how it&#39;s turned out.
