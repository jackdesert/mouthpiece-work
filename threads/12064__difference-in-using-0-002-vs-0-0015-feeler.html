            <pre class='message__body'>Hi!
 I am living in Sweden and I have been looking everywhere to find a feeler set with 0,0015 since mine from babbit is not straight anymore. 
 How much difference would it be for me when I measure you think? Could I go with the 0,05 mm(0,0020")?
 

 Do you know any hardware store with international shipping?
 
Is it possible to order just the 0,0015 since this is the most fragile?
 

 Thank you for any help you can give

            <pre class='message__body'>You don&#39;t need your .0015 straight. Straighten it with your fingers and go
on with it.

            <pre class='message__body'>While the specific reading you get with .002" (vs. .0015") is small, about 1 mm in facing 
length, it is still a good size for measuring total facing length.  It is also more resistant to 
kinking.  

A tenor mouthpiece that measures 22 mm facing length (or 44 on the Babbit gauge) with 
the .0015" feeler will measure about 21 mm facing length (or 42).  Just be aware of this 
difference.
