As many of you know, I have business interests in various parts of Asia. For
several years, I have been seeking a source of quality saxophone mouthpieces
there, and have met with only limited success.
 
In the last month, I have been contacted by several Asian vendors and have
received many samples. Some are of marginal quality (good for "practice
blanks" only), but a couple of the vendors provided samples that were of
amazing quality, absolutely equal to anything available anywhere at any
price. The tables were flat and the facings accurate. The materials used and
workmanship exhibited were of the very highest quality. They played great
right out of the box, with no tweaking necessary.
 
Another vendor offered me perfect (yes, I said perfect) copies of many well
known brands. They were indistinguishable from the originals except that
they lacked trademarks. The Guardala copies were particularly impressive.
 
It&#39;s about to become a different world. Some of our friends across the Great
Waters to the West have got it figured out, and I salute them. Their facing
work is as accurate as you can get anywhere, right up there with the
offerings from some of the very finest makers. The plating looks good. Even
the caps and ligatures are of good quality. Some of the original designs
were outstanding in their performance. Expect to see a lot of good quality
mouthpieces on the market from the Asians soon, and be thankful that the
options for players are expanding. The last 30 days have been a real eye
opener for me.

            <pre class='message__body'>In the musical instrument business, very few products are actually patented.
That&#39;s reality. Another reality is it&#39;s quite easy to get around most
patents. Yet another reality is that the cost of defending a patent overseas
is high, and the chance of a successful defense is slim.

So, does this mean trademakrs, patents, etc. are
pretty much out the window in the global economy? Just
curious, because I have an acquaintance whose designs
& name were used without permission or compensation.
Sounds much like what&#39;s been happening in the
copyright arena for some time.

I don&#39;t recall saying anything about the price. Was there something in my
post that doesn&#39;t appear on my screen?
 
The standard of living in Asia is improving at a faster rate than anywhere
else in the world. The people who work in the musical instrument industry
there are often highly skilled craftsmen who are very well paid. I know this
because I pay them!  Their standard of living is much higher than the
typical  manufacturing worker. It is most unfair of you to draw a comparison
between an economic system that is entirely different from the system used
in the western hemisphere.
 
It&#39;s a global economy. Goods and services are freely exchanged worldwide. If
you don&#39;t wish to patronize the products of a region, that is certainly your
right. However, I think you are somewhat uninformed as to the realities of
the musical instrument industry, based solely on the content of your post.

AGREED!!! The focus here should be the advancement of the art and craft 
of mouthpiece work. Personal differences, product promotion and 
argumentative debates are divergent paths from this forum&#39;s purpose.

As a matter of clarification:
 
(1) Most of the samples I have recently received have been ORIGINAL designs,
not copies. You can get copies, of course, but the people who have been
contacting me have their own designs, or are willing to produce any design
offered to them. They have the latest equipment insofar as lathes, milling
machines, etc. and apparently have pretty good plating facilities.
 
(2) Almost no mouthpiece designs are patented. Very, very few are. Do a
patent search and you&#39;ll see what I mean. Patents are generally a myth. Very
few mouthpiece makers go to the considerable expense necessary to file one.
Even if you file one, the cost of defending a patent on an international
basis is far more than you would make if you were selling 10,000 pieces a
year.
 
(3) the days of Asian saxophones being Mk VI copies are long over. You can
still get VI copies, or copies of just about anything you want, but most of
the Asian manufacturers (at least the major ones) now employ designers to
keep their horns original and unique.

Thanks to Steve for his insight to what may be coming down the road. It
sounds to me like it may parallel the Asian-made saxes where many of them
appear to be copies of Mark VI&#39;s etc. As we know, the merits of the Asian
saxes have been debated on the various sax forums ad naseum. I look
forward to some actual reviews of any new mouthpiece offerings here. But I
do not want to see personal, political or international rants on this
group.

We probably have many US mouthpiece patent infringements going on as it is.
I think mouthpiece patents are difficult and costly to enforce. I&#39;m
surprised at what ideas have been granted patents over the years. Some are
really unique, but they are not very practical, and are not in use. I
think "prior art" arguments might negate many mouthpiece patent
enforcements. But I&#39;m not a lawyer...

            <pre class='message__body'>Your analysis is only half correct. It has nothing to do with communism--it is pure capitalism: mobile capital fleeing to where it can get the most bang for the buck. A few years ago it was Japan and then Korea and Taiwan (hardly communist). As wages in those places started to rise capital moved
 to Vietnam, Indonesia, China, and as wages are rising here (I&#39;m writing from Beijing) capital is now moving into Cambodia, Laos, Africa...
   
  But you are right that externalities in the West--pollution control, for instance, and worker benefits such as health care, are minimal in developing (not communist) countries, and there is no way that capital, looking at maximizing profits in the short term, is going to be willing to support
 workers  in developed countries with their high wages, without capitalism developing a whole new way of looking at what matters in the world.
   
  BTW you should open your eyes to what is happening in China--profit is the new god here: there are thousands of Benz S600s and BMW 750s and Audi A6s cluttering up the roads, and these are not politicians driving them, but businessmen.

          As per previous requests, I will avoid politics, or at
least attempt to. First of all, I know you didn&#39;t
mention price, but it&#39;s been fairly obvious that
saxophones from Taiwan and China are priced lower than
those from Europe or Japan. It&#39;s logical to assume
mouthpieces will be similar.

Secondly, I apologize if I&#39;m off-base, but it appears
nigh impossible for a craftsman in the west to compete
and earn a living when a communist government doesn&#39;t
use free-market standards of living.

My point is that a Chinese worker is not paying the
same expenses as a westerner, nor is there any
allowance for profit. Are the Barones and Niewoods
etc. expected to lower their costs to compete when
they are living indifferent economic systems.

There&#39;s good reason why a designer suit costs more
than something you can by at a clothing store ending
in "mart"

No xenophobbia intended. It just seems that the global
economy is about us lowering instead of them rising
due to the almighty demand for the lowest prices.

If your Asian sources are from free democracies, I
stand corrected.

I shall stay silent henceforth.

I would respectfully submit that the demand for lower prices has come
primarily from Western consumers. I don&#39;t think we would hear many
complaints if excellent quality mouthpieces were available to players at
significantly lower prices.

Subject: RE: [MouthpieceWork] Asian mouthpieces



As per previous requests, I will avoid politics, or at
least attempt to. First of all, I know you didn&#39;t
mention price, but it&#39;s been fairly obvious that
saxophones from Taiwan and China are priced lower than
those from Europe or Japan. It&#39;s logical to assume
mouthpieces will be similar.

Secondly, I apologize if I&#39;m off-base, but it appears
nigh impossible for a craftsman in the west to compete
and earn a living when a communist government doesn&#39;t
use free-market standards of living.

My point is that a Chinese worker is not paying the
same expenses as a westerner, nor is there any
allowance for profit. Are the Barones and Niewoods
etc. expected to lower their costs to compete when
they are living indifferent economic systems.

There&#39;s good reason why a designer suit costs more
than something you can by at a clothing store ending
in "mart"

No xenophobbia intended. It just seems that the global
economy is about us lowering instead of them rising
due to the almighty demand for the lowest prices.

If your Asian sources are from free democracies, I
stand corrected.

I shall stay silent henceforth.

            <pre class='message__body'>In all of this, Steve is merely describing the reality of the musical instrument business.  It is here in this form whether we like it or not.
   
  Right now, a young player on a tight budget can buy a very nice instrument (from a wide range of choices), that equipped with a good mouthpiece can give as good a performance as any pro instrument of the past.  That is amazing.
   
  If instrument makers have been driven out of the USA and Europe, it is our own fault.
   
  I had remarked in the past that Selmer could use some lessons from Taiwan on how to lacquer a sax, but the reality is, environmental laws in Europe have adversely affected how the brass may be cleaned before lacquering.  Labor laws have made it nearly impossible to fire a "less than skillful" employee.
   
  I know from one of my other hobbies, model railroading, a manufacturer in California was almost driven out of business over environmental regulations and painting model railroad cars.  This was finally solved by the use of a new waterbased paint suitable for plastics and screen printing, at higher cost, of course.
   
  The international environmental movement is a form of economic warfare on the west.

Is anarchy entering this site, with a general sax discussion taking
place under the title &#39;Asian Mouthpieces&#39; ?
I would respectfully suggest, the place for this is at www.sotw.com &
not on this dedicated Mouthpiece - Refacing site.
Is it deliberate sabotage, or just an irritating mistake ?
IMO, it is certainly a confusing and unwanted intrusion.
I love the site the way it is and wish to thank Keith for starting it.

            <pre class='message__body'>In the "for what it&#39;s worth" department, two different makers sent me
samples that were damn near perfect.....much better than you customarily get
from most USA makers. Other makers have provided samples that were not quite
as good, but still pretty respectable.

And it would be even better if those high-priced mouthpieces did not require
further facing work to play properly!  Of course, that would deprive us of
all that fun!

I would respectfully submit that the demand for lower prices has come
primarily from Western consumers. I don&#39;t think we would hear many
complaints if excellent quality mouthpieces were available to players at
significantly lower prices.

As per previous requests, I will avoid politics, or at
least attempt to. First of all, I know you didn&#39;t
mention price, but it&#39;s been fairly obvious that
saxophones from Taiwan and China are priced lower than
those from Europe or Japan. It&#39;s logical to assume
mouthpieces will be similar.

Secondly, I apologize if I&#39;m off-base, but it appears
nigh impossible for a craftsman in the west to compete
and earn a living when a communist government doesn&#39;t
use free-market standards of living.

My point is that a Chinese worker is not paying the
same expenses as a westerner, nor is there any
allowance for profit. Are the Barones and Niewoods
etc. expected to lower their costs to compete when
they are living indifferent economic systems.

There&#39;s good reason why a designer suit costs more
than something you can by at a clothing store ending
in "mart"

No xenophobbia intended. It just seems that the global
economy is about us lowering instead of them rising
due to the almighty demand for the lowest prices.

If your Asian sources are from free democracies, I
stand corrected.

I shall stay silent henceforth.
