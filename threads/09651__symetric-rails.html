            <pre class='message__body'>Friends, I believe that the asymmetry in both rails as the sides of the tip of the mouthpiece, only reports problems, and that natural tendency, the cane does not oscillate evenly which a springboard for swimming, as it should, but hitting undulates from side to side top corner of the imbalance causing the cane that ends up breaking.
Vote to be symmetrical around a mouthpiece, I do not like surprises in that regard. If you try experimenting with synthetic reeds can be, but not my choice at the moment.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is absolutely true: asymmetric rails increase the chance of lateral motion around the central vertical axis of the reed, and that is the motion that causes squeaks. Asymmetric rails will work with reeds that are complimentarily asymmetric, but assuming that most reeds are balanced side to
 side, the best overall strategy is to have symmetric rails.

            <pre class='message__body'>AMEN to that strategy!

Besides, even though a skilled reed trimmer/shaver/sander/shaper can make a reed asymmetric to match, their time would be better spent making the fewer oddball reeds in the box symmetric then playing more. That is unless they enjoy whittling cane a lot.
