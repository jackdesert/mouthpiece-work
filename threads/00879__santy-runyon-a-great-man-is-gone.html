            <pre class='message__body'>My friends, I learned just a few minutes ago that my good friend, and
mentor for many years, Santy Runyon has passed away this afternoon,
Friday, April 4, 2003, just a few days short of his 96th birthday, which
would have been April 12.

For those that do not know of Santy&#39;s background, he began playing in
his father&#39;s movie theater, in the pit band, back in the "silent movies"
days.  He started out on "traps", doing all the various sound effects:
hoofbeats for horses, cap guns for cowboy gunfights, sheet of tin for
thunder, etc.  Later, he learned woodwinds.

By the time he was 17, he was "on the road" with the Jack Teagarden big
band.  He later played with Henry Busse and His Monmarte Orchestra, lead
alto and arranger.  Santy&#39;s hot dance arrangements (including Busse&#39;s
theme, "Hot Lips"), with their shuffle rhythm and driving bass lines,
were the hit of the day.

By the time he was age 21, in 1928, he was principal woodwind of the
famous Chicago Theatre, where he played eight shows a day.  The three
night shows were broadcast coast to coast on NBC Radio.  He playing was
heard all over the country, and soon the word spread among professional
players, when you go to Chicago, be sure to take a lesson from Santy
Runyon at the Chicago Theatre.  Some years later his teaching skills
were in demand, he had to quit the theatre and opened Runyon Studio,
famous for turning out professional musician.  His students were a
virtual "Who&#39;s Who" of the jazz world... Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt,
Paul Desmond, Lee Konitz, Chu Berry, and many, many more.

His first commercial mouthpiece was the Runyon Custom bari sax
mouthpiece, still produced today.  It was featured in an ad in Downbeat
Magazine, endorsed by famous bari men Harry Carney (Duke Ellington) and
Charlie Fowlkes (Count Basie).

Runyon Products, which started in 1939, continues to produce fine
mouthpieces for students and professionals.
