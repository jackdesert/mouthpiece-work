      The sound generated by the mouthpiece and player would be

            <pre class='message__body'>That theory has been reaffirmed over and over again by rigorous scientific testing for the last 150 years. When you are talking about wind instruments it is the internal bore dimensions and not the material (of both mpc and instrument) that affect the tonal characteristics and response. After that comes bore smoothness. Vibration of the walls contribute less than 1/10000 the radiated sound energy.

Your rattle test is completely tangential to the argument. It involves elliptical deformation of the tube--something that doesn&#39;t happen at all with a round bore when you are playing. I&#39;d be happy to post the relevant section in Fletcher and Rossing&#39;s book if anyone is interested.
