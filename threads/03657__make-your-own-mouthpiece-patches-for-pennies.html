            <pre class='message__body'>Hi 
I posted this on SOTW too.I thought you all might have some other or
better ideas .

I&#39;ve been trying out lots of mouthpieces lately and it&#39;s expensive to
put patches on all of them . I like the clear Runyon ones and they are
around $1.25-$1.75 each .
I bought a huge roll (several square feet) of clear mylar at
Tap-Plastic for a dollar or so. It&#39;s a bit thinner then the Runyon
patches but works fine .  
1) Cut out some patches and stick them on some clear packing tape .
2) Pull the patch off the tape and the sticky stuff stays on it .
3) Put on the mouthpiece 
You can do a bunch , leave the tape on and keep them in your case .
I used the Office Depot Premium Clear Packing Tape but you can
experiment with different types . Duct tape did not work for me .

Hi 
I posted this on SOTW too.I thought you all might have some other or
better ideas .

I&#39;ve been trying out lots of mouthpieces lately and it&#39;s expensive to
put patches on all of them . I like the clear Runyon ones and they are
around $1.25-$1.75 each .
I bought a huge roll (several square feet) of clear mylar at
Tap-Plastic for a dollar or so. It&#39;s a bit thinner then the Runyon
patches but works fine .  
1) Cut out some patches and stick them on some clear packing tape .
2) Pull the patch off the tape and the sticky stuff stays on it .
3) Put on the mouthpiece 
You can do a bunch , leave the tape on and keep them in your case .
I used the Office Depot Premium Clear Packing Tape but you can
experiment with different types . Duct tape did not work for me .

            <pre class='message__body'>You can make great patches from Neoprene gasket material cut to size
and mounted with double-sided cellophane tape. The patches cost almost
nothing and are very very durable. The thickness is perfect, as they
do not damp out vibrations as thicker patches do. I replace them every
8-10 weeks when I clean my mouthpieces. Often the patch is still OK
and I just replace the 2-sided tape. - B Smith
