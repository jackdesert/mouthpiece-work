            <pre class='message__body'>I thought that some of you who do repairs might be interested.  I just got my bottle, but haven&#39;t used it yet.  

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=400065818862&ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:US:1123

I&#39;m waiting for my MME binder from a beauty shop supplier (after doing the research and finding that acrylic nail polish uses the same toxic, flammable, carcinogenic binder as used in the dental industry).  Apparently, the FDA sees no problem with oral applications once the material is cured.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find a concensus as to the length of time necessary to fully cure, even on a MSDS.  

This is scary stuff.  The MSDS says the necessary equipment is a hood fan, rubber gloves, goggles, a Class B fire extinguisher, etc.  Basically, use the same precautions that you would use while building a neurotoxic weapon of mass destruction.

http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/englishhtml/m5616.htm

Black acrylic powder is also available from the beauty supply places, by it&#39;s more expensive than from this discount seller.  

I know who wears black nail polish, but who wears black dentures?

You mix the powder with MMA (methyl methacrylate) into either a putty for dental work or, with less powder, a "paint" for fingernail work.  My bottle of powder says mix 2:1, which I assume is 2 parts powder to one part MMA to form a putty for dental work.  I found one site that said if you wet the surface first with MMA, the putty will adhere better.  Keep in mind, I haven&#39;t worked with the stuff yet, but others here have.

Dentistry has been aware for some time of the problems associated with working the putty with your bare hands, although a couple of "movie makeup" web sites still say that you can make your fake fangs by working the putty with your fingers and don&#39;t mention using gloves.  

I have a pair of heavy rubber "chemical" gloves that I might use.  It sounds like anything less (latex or dishwashing gloves) might dissolve.  If the stuff dissolves your gloves, the solution isn&#39;t to do the work barehanded.

I&#39;m also curious as to whether making a putty is even required.  For small chip repair, teeth guards, and maybe even baffles, it looks like applying with a small brush might work.  Look at the applications on the nail sites, where they use tape to mask areas and successive layers to build up and fill in areas.

I&#39;m buying the MMA off of ebay where they sell lots of it in small amounts for acrylic fingernail polish.  Search for "acrylic nail" and you&#39;ll get several hundred options.  Some of them come with a selection of acrylic powder, so if you&#39;re doing baffles and don&#39;t care about color, you can make them pink, white, or clear with a kit like this one:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item)0356638637&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT

There&#39;s also sparkly acrylic powder.  Maybe next time.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Mojo, thanks for that recommendation. I did a search and found some of those reports that seemed to be referring to the chemical in it&#39;s un-cured state. It does sound like something you don&#39;t just wanna get all over your skin before it&#39;s cured, but I did find one page about nail acrylic that said the following: " Additionally most dental prostheses are made outside of the mouth and like nail acrylic, once polymerised and cured dental composites are safe when placed in contact with human tissue." http://www.thenailstudiocolchester.co.uk/information/mma.php But that site doesn&#39;t sound like a government-sanctioned entity or anything that official... From what I can tell though, it seems like most of these acrylic materials doesn&#39;t seem to bother people when they&#39;re cured. I read a bunch of stuff online about ladies getting allergic reactions on their skin when getting their nails done with acrylic, but this is where they&#39;d put the material on their skin before it was cured. So, I may try to ask someone in the medical field about it and will post here if I find out anything.

We should be as diligent as possible with the safety of the materials we use for 
repairs.  But I often wonder if mouthpiece makers are as diligent over the 
years.  Players tent to trust the makers more than the refacer/repair techs.

I was using white powder for a Beechler bit plate which was white, but they have the black powder at local shops too.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dental acrylic may not be significantly safer.  I believe the risks are in the 
repeated handling of the monomer fluid.  But the fake nail artists and users 
should die off before refacers do.  That is the warning I&#39;m looking for.

            <pre class='message__body'>I suppose. My father, a dentist, used this stuff, and Xylol as well, did
lots of his own acrylic work rather than sending out to a lab,  no fume
hood, lived to 86, and it&#39;s not what killed him either.
