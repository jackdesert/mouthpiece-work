Is there an effective way to enlarge the bore diameter of a brass mouthpiece without a rotary tool?  About .30"...

Thanks in advance.

            <pre class='message__body'>I enlarged the bore diameter of a too-tight soprano hard rubber mouthpiece using wet-dry sandpaper wrapped around a dowel of suitable diameter.

.30" is a huge amount - are you trying to use a soprano mouthpiece on a tenor?  Alto, tenor and bari bore sizes do not vary by .30" - actualy, come to think of it, I don&#39;t think the difference between a soprano and bari bore is .30".  

Do you mean 0.030"?  Or perhaps 0.3 mm?

If you in fact mean 30 thousandths or 3 tenths of a millimeter, with a brass mouthpiece you can probably do this by hand with a dowel and, say, 100 grit wet-or-dry paper.  It will take time, and probably several new applications of paper as the old ones fill up.  With stainless steel, forget it.

HTH,
Steve Keller

Yes, mm!  Sorry, I&#39;m used to working with standard measurements, not metric.

Thanks for your insight.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hm, actually metric is the standard system in most parts of the world apart from the USA . . . no big deal though : )

            <pre class='message__body'>I would think you could easily do it with a hand reamer.

Hi all-

Is there an effective way to enlarge the bore diameter of a brass mouthpiece
without a rotary tool? About .30"...

Thanks in advance.

Best, Matt

Matt, it might help you to know, something to be aware of...

Metal, and other machined mouthpieces, the bore is cylindrical as it is bored as you would expect.

Molded mouthpieces, the bore is very slightly tapered.  This is so that the bore core die of the dies used to mold the shape may be withdrawn without distorting the still hot and soft plastic material.

Just an additional factor you run into with mouthpiece bores and neck corks.

Dremel makes a 1/2" drum sander in two grits.  Best would be to put the bit in a drill press and use both hands on the mp.  Might still need hand finishing.
