            <pre class='message__body'>The tip of my mouthpiece has a couple of dents that come slightly across the tip rail.  Can I apply some gentle heat on the bite side to make the dents return to their original position?   Hot cloth?   i guess this is calling upon the memory of the hard rubber.

            <pre class='message__body'>If it&#39;s a hard rubber piece, rub the tip gently against an ordinary  
incandescent light bulb. If they are dents and not chips, they often  
come out.
