Well, with all due respect, we are not grinding up epoxy baffles and
eating them, nor implanting them inside the body cavity. 

True, an
epoxy mouthpiece baffle is bathed in saliva, so there would be some
chance for unpolymerized components at the surface to be dissolved,
ingested. Although I would be more worried about the long-term exposure
of mucous membranes of the mouth to such chemicals. 

Paul&#39;s suggestion
of coating with nail polish seems smart, in this regard - although how
inert is nail polish? 

To put things in perspective, the risk of buying
the farm due to an auto accident on the way to a gig probably is several
orders of magnitude greater than any risk from mouthpiece baffles of
cured epoxy.

 If you&#39;re looking for a good friction fit, but also for
removability of a baffle in a metal mouthpiece, don&#39;t you need a little
"give" in the baffle insert, since the metal mouthpiece has no give.


I&#39;d think for a metal mouthpiece, a plastic baffle insert is a
necessity, in order to get a tight fit, removability, and also some
small ability to alter its position between the tip and the throat.
Small increments here can make a difference. (Hmm, just had an idea how
one might lock the position with a small set-screw)

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a dental acrylic resin powder material that is a little more
challenging to work with than epoxy but I feel a little more comfortable.
 It is also a nice bite plate replacement material.  It&#39;s harder than sheet
acrylic but it polishes to a really nice luster.

            <pre class='message__body'>Plumbers epoxy often states on the package that it is safe for drinking
water supply repairs. That is non toxic enough for me! JB Weld will be
tougher, but is not made for the purpose. Who knows what might leach out of
something meant to repair industrial metal parts.
Brass soft enough to machine easily has usually had some lead in it. That
has been a controversial issue for the plumbing industry. You may get more
lead from your mouthpiece than any insert material you use, especially if
you do not have it plated.
In short, use the plumber&#39;s epoxy that says it is safe or run around like
Chicken Little and scream the sky is falling.
