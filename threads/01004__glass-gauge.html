            <pre class='message__body'>Babbitt also sells a tip opening gauge. It&#39;s sort of a "quick and dirty"
type, but plenty accurate enough for 90% of the time. Seems like it was
about ten bucks, and well worth it.

            <pre class='message__body'>The preferred glass gauge is the one with zero flush with the edge.

The glass gauge is placed on the table of the mouthpiece, and the
mouthpiece tip and glass are pushed gently against the vertical surface
of the workbench edge, holding the mouthpiece and glass perpendicular,
in order to align the zero (edge) of the glass gauge with the tip.

In this way consistent alignment is obtained, for consistent
measurements.

            <pre class='message__body'>Paul&#39;s technique with zeroing the flush gage sounds excellent.

I have been using wide set-back gages.  They are prone to zeroing problems
since placement must be done by eye.  You need to sight on the tip of the
MP through the glass gage.  The line of sight must be perpendicular to the
face of the gage.

The only problem with mechnically finding zero with the flush gage would be
holding the MP and gage perpendicular to the workbench edge.  To me, this
sounds easier to do and more consistent than zeroing by eye.

One minor advantage of the set-back gage is when you measure near the tip
(near zero) the extra glass beyond zero supports the last feeler gage
better.

            <pre class='message__body'>I called Babbitt today. They do have the glass gauge, so I (mail)
ordered it.

Thanks,
Bill

PS: If I understood Jim Green correctly, they no longer sell the 
taper gauge, which I also wanted. He mentioned something else, as an 
alternative, but I didn&#39;t get the details.
