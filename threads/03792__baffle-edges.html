            <pre class='message__body'>Is there a technique for getting the edges neat where the rails meet 
the tip.  I find it quite difficult to get a neat roundness sometimes 
especially on Berg metals where a little bit of push and shove is 
needed.
thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>I occassionally use a pocketknife with a small straight blade to 
detail the corners.  Most of the time they come in for me using files 
and sandpaper.  That is all you can use on stainless steel.
