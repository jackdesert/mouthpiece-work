        Sorry I live in AFRICA .  
        I have heard feedback from people who have used Anderson for saxophones. Just make sure they understand that
        " NO BUFFING " means " ABSOLUTELY NO BUFFING " .
        Silverplating is not a big deal. The coating spreads well , needs minimum polishing . 
        In the past I did my own silver plating with good results. Since my volume was to low I stopped.

All,
 
I&#39;m wondering who(m) people have used as plating companies?
I know of Anderson plating - any others? Specifically, that have 
experience plating mouthpieces? 
 
Thanks

          I would only use spot plating on the table area , when the object is to prevent oxidation.   If areas on the rails lacks
          plating it is best to get the facing curve up to specification and replate.   I would not remove any silverplating  before
          replating if the curve is correct.  After applying about 20 microns of silver the Mouthpiece and curve can be lightly polished 
          by hand. Then the curve should be  checked.
          Make the plating company understand that NO BUFFING should be done at any stage.
          If the plating was done without buffing , at normal (or low) current density , with the correct size anode , the facing curve
          should need no work.

Thanks, Toby. That&#39;s what I was afraid of. Can these
little areas be spot-plated or do I need to take the
silver off the entire table and facing? I&#39;d surely
ruin the mouthpiece if I attempted that. I&#39;ve not had
great success at refacing recently.

I have seen many mouthpieces ruined by jewelers that tried 
replating. Alf was with me once and saw Lional Kielly&#39;s Florida Link 
that was buffed like it was going out of fasion. 

Last week I did some work on Mike Rossi&#39;s Link, also buffed before 
gold plating - siderails and tip is ROUND = leaking. 

You CAN achieve perfectly even plating 95% of the times - using tank 
plating. For this you need to experiment a lot to find the tweak. 
The piece need to be in a certain direction towards the origin of 
the current. 

I seldom need to make adjustments after plating, but it took a long 
time to get the secret. 

I currently ask $55 for plating + $85 for the reface. This ensures a 
great playing piece with excellent plating that&#39;s even and that will 
last. I use a plater in Port Elizabeth, but all polishing is done by 
me and by hand.

There are descriptions of how to position the object to be plated vs 
anode shape and position on Caswell&#39;s site.

I have seen many mouthpieces ruined by jewelers that tried 
replating&lt;&lt; 
 
 
Uh... I don&#39;t know what physical laws are suspended where you live, but where I live, in the plating process the dispersion of silver, gold, or rhodium is even across the substrate.If you start out with rounded rails, you&#39;ll end up with rounded rails. You&#39;re suggesting that the immersion plating process results in uneven plating. This just doesn&#39;t happen. You can spot plate and build up areas. Perhaps that&#39;s the process you&#39;re familiar with.
 
I&#39;ve photographed extremely fine, plated Edwardian era filigree brooches and  plated mesh which was so fine one would swear it was woven cloth. How can this happen? It can happen because the process takes place on the atomic level.
 
I suspect that the jewelers whose work you&#39;ve seen are in a completely different market from those whose work I&#39;ve photographed. My accounts compete with Tiffany, not Bling Bling n Things.

Yes, jewelers will ruin your mouthpiece. I lied. 

Especially stay away from the guys who have thirty or more years&#39; experience at plating. They&#39;re the absolute worst.

            <pre class='message__body'>I theory we think that plating will be even all over the object, but 
this isn&#39;t true. 

Experience has shown me (using tank plating) that the actual deposit 
will be more on large flat surfaces of the mouthpiece than on thin 
rails and corners. 

Measuring the piece afterwards will also give away facing changes. 

I specially sanded some pieces plated down to check for this and on 
a sax mpc. plating is a whole lot thicker on the body than on the 
small areas like rails and sharp corners. 

To get perfectly even plating on the rails and table (which is most 
important) you have to position the mouthpiece in a very specific 
way when lowering it into the tank. 

This of course all depends on have accurately each layer is (first I 
flash dip it in copper, then 3 min nickle and 15 min silver)

Now this is done is a 200litre nickle tank and 100 litre silver 
tank - I have not done brush plating yet.

            <pre class='message__body'>Brush plating goes on so thin, it does not seem to effect the dimensions of
the piece.  It also does not last long on high wear areas (rails).  Corners
wear off faster too.  Perhaps the plating is thinner there and the edges
get more wear.  This has been my experiance so far.

Gonna send you a silver plated cowan, Paul. (Also spelled "cowen" and "coin," depending upon which end of St. Bernard Avenue you buy your local delicacies on). I don&#39;t think the cowan is gonna be too happy about it, though.

I have to ask about this in private... there are several translations of 
this word.

For those who are unfamiliar, NOCCA is New Orleans Center for the 
Creative Arts,  a school where young musicians are taugth by some very 
fine musicians indeed!

I heard Alvin Battiste (legendary New Orleans clarinetist) with his 
quartet at a high school jazz festival a few years ago.  He was was 
jazzin&#39; along when I realized he was going right down the page, line 
after line, of the Klose.

            <pre class='message__body'>200 and 100 liter tanks!? Whoa.
 
In truth, my education in the plating process began when this thread began. I have access to jewelers who do this work on a regular basis and who do contract work for other jewelers, so I started asking questions and watching last week after a shoot. (I photograph in-store because I really don&#39;t feel like transporting  single pieces of jewelry that cost more than everything I own combined.
 
The tanks that the jewelers I know use much smaller tanks (probably 1 liters and four liters--- I may be off by a liter or two). What I am seeing being plated are very intricately tooled rings and bracelets (designed and created in-house) as well as very plain bangle-type bracelets. 
 
If you&#39;re working with 200 and 100 liter tanks, you&#39;re plating more than mouthpieces, I suspect. You must plate whole horns and automobile bumpers. You&#39;ve got a whole lot more going on in your tanks  than a jeweler would have going on in his tanks, and a whole lot more invested in equipment to control the variables (e.g., recovery systems and the like). 
 
Something which hadn&#39;t occurred to me is this: when you use a larger tank, are you  likely to have a more or less "accurate" or even distribution of the plating material than if you were to use a smaller tank? (If you use only these larger tanks, you might not know).

            <pre class='message__body'>Now I&#39;m kinda scared about sending folks to the jeweler for replating. Lord help me. As I type, a friend&#39;s Link is  in the jeweler&#39;s tank. I got a call from the jeweler telling me that someone came in and dropped it off and gave my name as a reference. Luckily, the guy who is doing the plating understands the issues. 
 
He said, "Keep your shirt on. Piece of cake." 
 
If those don&#39;t sound like famous last words...
