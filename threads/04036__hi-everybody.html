            <pre class='message__body'>i&#39;m vince lahorra, 38, from manila, the philippines. i took up the sax in 1990 at what i call the 
University of Self Teaching and Experience (yup, no formal training &#39;cept for classical piano 
lessons since i was nine). stan getz is my main influence, straight ahead jazz is my devotion. 

i&#39;ve been a gigging pro for ten years now. my current gear includes a 1968 mark VI tenor and 
an S-901 yanagisawa soprano, both of which i&#39;m very happy with.  i recently treated myself to 
a new ref 54 tenor. two words: tenor heaven! sorry guys, the mark VI ain&#39;t for sale. 

it&#39;s good to have a resource such as this group that focuses on &#39;pieces. informative and 
enlightening. and i was just browsing at the messages...

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Vince, I was living in Cebu for 8 tears, until 2003! I play there in the first two rock festivals (with many young group from Manila too). Unfortunately in Cebu the jazz is something only for old Pilipino back from USA... a very nice place was open at the main square of Cebu buy bankrupt in some months!!! Now close, no jazz, no Stan Getz, and I don&#39;t know there jazz musician. I&#39;m a pro drummer and I play sax too. Still I own a place in the beach of Moalboal, famous for divers, where on 1996 we made the first show and from that time every saturday the place is getting the place to go in. But rock rock and rock... Jimi Hendrix sound and cover and jam with any musician acrossing there! Only a few times was passing there a jazz musician from some place in the world and so I had occasion to play my favourite music.
 Give me your email address, we stay on touch... maybe a day when I will be back there, in a year or two, we can meet and see to organize something. I&#39;ve many friends musician pilipino, and a good bass player have the touch as John Patitucci (he like slap too). With him I had a nice gig of funky music, you know...drummer love the good bass player.
 You talk about your sax, but this is a mp site... except me with this long story (missing PH), what mp are you using? what&#39;s your best set? I hope is not the new Selmer. I found it a very impersonal sax, with no caracter and personality... if this is the revelation... better Selmer go back to make nice sax! I play SML Gold Medal and Rev.D on tenor and alto... those are sax as Mark VI, still better for me, and I like them and I like too the Buffet S1 or SDA.
 My mouthpiece set is for alto a vintage Bilger-Morgan, for tenor I use a Phil Barone or a Dukoff, remeid by the administrator of this site! Mr.Mojo.
 Send me your direct address to: cubismofree@... we can be on touch.
 Ciao Stanvince... Gian Luca
