            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve just taken an old Conn Eagle Alto piece from 55 thou tip to 80 thou tip. Fortunately there was enough material to do this. I have given the piece a small roll over being carefull not to leave the roll over to high. The piece is still basically all chamber with hugely rounded side walls.
I have never worked on one of these before.
This piece is to be used with a 1920&#39;s Conn.

On a Mk6 alto the piece plays well over the horn even in to the harmonics. Great bottom end and not a bad sound but is extremely very dull. 

Is this normal? 

If I took the roll over down to basically nothing , would it liven the piece up? 

Cheers to all.

Ross

            <pre class='message__body'>I would suggest that it needs more baffle, not less.  Opening a tip makes the sound darker so making a rool-over out of the roof material is a good thing to start with.  Try a gentle arched baffle made out of temporary putty.  You could fill in the sides too, but then it will be like other straight-walled mouthpieces.  So do this just for the trial experience to see how significant the change is.

The chamber is so large (even larger now that you&#39;ve opened it a lot) and so steep you&#39;ll never get a modern (i.e. post 1930s) jazz sound out of it without adding material.  The baffle is too short, and for the chamber width the floor is too steep.
