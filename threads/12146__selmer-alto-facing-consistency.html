            <pre class='message__body'>My records show I have measured 3 Alto LTs.  One in 2007 and two in 2012.  In my system they were as follows:
 

 .067", 41, +4
 .063", 40, +6
 .072", 42, +3
 

 The +# is the aspect ratio of the elliptical fit.  +1 is radial, +4 is a medium amount of resistance IMO.  
 

 FYI, I recently was sent 4 Selmer S90 180 mouthpieces to work on.  They all had pretty good facings but not the same.  One had a major flat spot and several were minor crooked in spots.  They measured:
 

 
  .062", 42, +6
  .056", 36.5, +4
  .052", 36, +3
  .064", 45, +9
