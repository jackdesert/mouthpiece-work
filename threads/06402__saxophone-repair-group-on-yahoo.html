Subject: Saxophone Repair Group on Yahoo!


  Since 2004, I have maintained a group on Yahoo devoted strictly to
saxophone repair. We currently
have 525 members and lots of vigorous discussion. Many of our members are
full time techs who
spend all day every day fixing saxophones. Some of our members are students
and players who just want to learn how to keep their personal instruments in
top condition. All are welcome! To join this moderated group (no trolls
need apply), simply visit 
 
http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SaxophoneRepair/ 
 
and sign up! You can take a look at the most recent discussions and see the
posting history at the bottom of the page. You can choose to receive posts
in "real time" in your email, a daily digest of posts, or just read the
group on the site. If you play saxophone, there&#39;s lots of knowledge here you
can use.
