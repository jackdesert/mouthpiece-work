            <pre class='message__body'>Has anybody seen one of these? They sell for $60 more than the 
other "standard" chambers (M,D,P,S,X,L,H). No mention of them on the 
Dukoff web site which hasn&#39;t been updated in ages. One could only 
hope that the extra cost is due to quality hand finishing. Ya&#39; never 
know.

The info on the WWBW web site: "Designed to provide the player with 
better projection and volume, the Super Power Plus offers a powerful 
tone with good control and an even scale."  Are they saying that the 
standard chambers don&#39;t offer any of those "features"? Funny... and a 
bit tragic.

Its just another reason for this love/hate thing I have for Dukoff 
mouthpieces.

You might try to find a D chamber in brass. I just did
an album with one of those and they record grat and
have alot of sound too.  they are sometimes offered on
Ebay.

I&#39;m not really looking to buy one necessarily, just
want to know what the "Plus" chamber is. I&#39;ve got too
many Dukoffs as is (around 15 total spread across SAT
in different chambers), most have been refaced by
myself and a couple by JVW. Been playing Dukes for 20
over years - I hate their inconsistancy but I love how
a good one plays.

I have only seen vintage Dukoffs in brass, everything
I have is Silverite. Where did you find yours? Mojo
has seen chrome plated. The local shop has new &#39;D&#39;
chambers, but none are plated.

I&#39;ve called Dukoff, left messages and sent email with
no response.

Jon

            <pre class='message__body'>Several clients have sent me new-looking Duks that are Nickle 
plated.  I asked them where they got them and several said WW&BW.  I 
dont know if they were a special run or the newest design.

I got mine used, but if you can get the number to the
Dukoff factory, and ask for Bobby he might be there.
