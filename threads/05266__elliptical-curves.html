            <pre class='message__body'>Can anyone recommend a mouth-safe epoxy or glue for reattaching a bite 
guard? I was considering using some dental epoxy since that&#39;s safe, but 
because it&#39;s so specific to "teeth" the box doesn&#39;t mention if it works for 
rubber or plastic. This is the simple little temporary tooth repair kits 
you can buy at the drug store. I suppose I could just try it and see if it 
works, but figured I&#39;d ask first.

This is one of the newer Berg Larsen mpc&#39;s. I got it cheap and it actually 
plays pretty well but good grief does the quality suck. I dropped it onto 
carpet from a height of 3 feet and the bite guard just fell out without any 
(other) damage. Not much sign of previous epoxy or glue so it&#39;s no wonder 
it fell out. My 16 yr old Berg shows a white-colored epoxy peaking out from 
around the edges (I bought it from the factory 16 yrs ago, so apparently 
they&#39;re using something different now).

Thanks,
Kirk

I did a lot of research on elliptical curves a few years back and there 
is no exact formula for this type of curve,  there are some that come 
close but none exact.  Tom

            <pre class='message__body'>You will need to make up your own mind what is safe.  This has been
discussed several times here.  The Search feature is note that great, but
after hitting it a few time to bring up older posts you should find some
info.

One thing I find interesting is that the general mouthpiece-playing public
just assumes that the original bite plate and epoxy materials are
non-toxic.  I&#39;m unaware of any regulatory agency that insures this for us. 
The closest thing we have in the US are MSDS sheets.  I doubt anyone has
asked a mouthpiece maker to supply these for the materials they use.  I&#39;m
not real concerned, but I find the trust in the makers and distrust in the
repairers (me) a little out of wack.

MSDS sheets are fairly easy to get for epoxy repair materials.  I have them
for several of the materials I use.  But there are on-going studies and
debates that there are dangers not disclosed in these data sheets. 
Generally speaking, epoxy components can be dangerous but become safe
(safer) when thoroughly mixed and cured.  This can be said of Dental
epoxies too.

I would use a clear 5-minute epoxy to reattach the bite plate.  Devcon is
one brand.  http://www.devcon.com/devconfamilyproduct.cfm?familyid5

The MSDS says in the beginning: "After curing, this product is
non-hazardous."  Then is descibes some of the nastys the separate hardener
and resin can do.

either, but I&#39;m not worrying about it too much (we could waste our lives

epoxy also since drinking water could come into contact with it and 
presumably be safe.

Thanks for the info! And I&#39;ll try to use the Search feature more, too.

I have developed my own elliptical facing curve formula.  One day I 
plan to share it with the world, but for now it is one of the few 
things I have that I consider proprietary.  But I&#39;ll talk about it to 
some extent.

Also take a look at Theo&#39;s new site for how he calculates facing 
curves using a quadratic curve fit of his extensive database.  I think 
the curves he came up are not distinguishable from elliptical curves.  
However he does not give you the equation constants that make it all 
work.

epoxy also since drinking water could come into contact with it and 
presumably be safe.

Thanks for the info! And I&#39;ll try to use the Search feature more, too.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use the following equations. In these

x = distance along facing
x = 0 at the point where the plane of the table is tangent to the
curve of the facing (x = 0 is NOT the tip!)

y = opening of the facing

Circular facing with raduis "r"
x^2 + y^2 - 2yr = 0
			
Parabolic facing with constant "a"
y - a x^2 = 0
			
Ellipse must specify aspect ratio "ar" and constant "a"
ar^2 x^2 + y^2 - ar a y = 0
for 2:1 ellipse 
4 x^2 + y^2 - 2 a y = 0

Of course, the values of x and y must be converted to the appropriate
scales. I use these equations to find the best fit of measured data to
a geometric facing, but I first convert the scale reading and the
thickness of the gages into the same units for fitting. I will try to
upload a spreadsheet demonstrating this into the "files" section.

Hey Chic

What about glass ionomer cement for this use?
Any other safe dental adhesives that you might suggest?

I think the search here is for a clearly certified safe adhesive (not 
just a vague MSDS sheet recommendation).

Thanks,

Ted

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Ted.
Glass ionomers as are many of the dental "cements" are actually not 
cements.  They are luting agents.  The difference is that a luting 
agent fills in the microscopic voids between the casting and the 
tooth.  It doesn&#39;t have "sticky" properties like say contact cement.  
One good sticky dental cement that comes to mind is Durelon.  It has 
a high sticky property, is impervious to saliva and gets quite hard.  
Its kindof pink when dried but its non toxic.

It is posted in the Files - Clarinet section.

I need to study it a little more.  The examples Brent used show no
significant difference between the radial, elliptical, and parabolic curve
for clarinet.  The elliptical aspect ratio he used is = 2.  A more
exaggerated 4 is more common for sax facing curves, but they vary a lot.

His parabolic curve is reversed from what I have heard some clarinet makers
use.  Theirs start more curved at the table and become straighter towards
the tip.  This can also be approximated with an elliptical curve that has
an aspect ration less than one.

            <pre class='message__body'>Inspired by these posts, I&#39;ve created my own spreadsheet for
calculating elliptical shaped facing curves.  You can also compare the
results to a radial curve.  The elliptical ratio can changed by simply
changing the value in the  yellow input box and the curve will update.
 You can see that for ratios of 2 or less, the ellipse becomes
virtually identical to a radial curve.

The formula for the radial curve is based on pythagoras&#39;s triangle to
find the coordinates for the circle.  The elliptical formula is the
same, but stretched sideways according to the ellipical ratio.

Hope this is useful . . .


Regards, Andrew

            <pre class='message__body'>Andrew put this file in the Files - Methods section last July.  I 
missed taking a look at it until now.  It looks like a nice 
implementation.  It has a lot of features similar to what I use.
