Use the resources gathered on the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site.  Not just the
forum, but all the files, photos and links.

If you can locate a refacer in your area, see if you can visit them to see
them work and possibly take some lessons.  Some refacers are a little
squirrelly about sharing their knowledge, but it does not hurt to ask.

Measure, measure, measure. Practice, practice, practice.  Try it as a hobby
first.  Very few turn it into their primary career without taking a vow of poverty.
