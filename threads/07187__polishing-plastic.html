            <pre class='message__body'>About getting a nice shiny like-new sheen on black plastic. Actually this is for a clarinet barrel but I&#39;m figuring you guys have the info. I have tried a 1200 paper with and w/o oil, chamois, Flitz. I don&#39;t have a polishing machine so hopefully this can be done by hand. Someone told me 2000 paper with oil but where I live 2000 paper is not to be had and anywhere I see to order it I have to get multiple sheets which I would unlikely use. Any ideas?

            <pre class='message__body'>After you get the surface smooth with 1200 paper (we use 2000, but 1200
would work although it will require a bit more final effort) we use Kit
plastic polish. Be VERY careful using any sort of power tool, as it is quite
easy to damage the finish by heat or excessive buffing.

smells very good as well)

>  One possible source for 2000 grit paper, if there&#39;s one in your area, would be an auto supply store such as NAPA, that caters to professional body shops.  They typically handle 3M papers in fine grits, and you can buy them by the sheet, although they won&#39;t have PSA (adhesive-backed)papers.       One thing to always keep in mind when using sandpaper is that the labeled grit number, even on good papers, is an average number, which means a small portion of the grit particles will be more coarse, and some will be finer.  A method used by professional woodworkers is to cut two pieces from the sheet, and rub them together, face to face a few times.  This helps wear down the larger particles a bit, and will give you a finer finish.  It reduces the life of the paper slightly, but that&#39;s a small price to pay.

            <pre class='message__body'>try a leather strap impregnated with polishing compound--similar to that used 100 years ago to sharpen a razor or knife. hold firmly on the body of the mouthpeice with the left thumb and pull firmly and quickly with the other hand several times

Once I have finished smoothing scratches with 800, then 1000, then 1200 paper, then finally 2000 paper, I polish BY HAND, NOT BUFFING WHEEL, with a soft cloth and Kit Scratch Out.  This is a plastic polish intended for plexiglass/acrylic windshields, motorcycle faceshields, etc.

Others use Flitz or other fine polishes, and I am sure those probably work as well.

This only takes a few minutes but greatly improves the impression of your work quality to your customer.

            <pre class='message__body'>i have a unique way of polishing wood and getting rid of scratches and discolouration: once i have polished the wood using my leather strap impregnated with polishing compound (the strap is directly similar to the one used by your grandfather to sharpen his razor) i cover the wood with black indelible marker pen; when almost dry rub vaseline over the area and rub hard with a cloth; then repolish with the leather strap.
