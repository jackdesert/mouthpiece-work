Searching for "crocus cloth" also turns up some hits but you may not want a cloth.

I find anything finer than 600 (US-scale) = 1200 (P-scale) to be too fine for rail work.  I use "0000" steel wool for body finishing.

Try any auto repair or parts shop.  They almost all carry 2000 and even some
8000 grit wet or dry paper.

            <pre class='message__body'>Smallparts.com is a convenient source for these types of products.  Under sandpaper you will find the 3M Light Blue Ultrafine 9 micron  paper that is the equivalent of 2000 grit.

If you are polishing a plastic clarinet barrel, you also might consider putting it snugly on the right size dowel, holding the dowel in a vise, and hand "ragging" it with a soft cloth using a fine metal polish. Just don&#39;t get too carried away and generate too much heat with the friction! When finished just wash it off and hit it with a coat of Pledge furniture polish and you have a nice finish.
