            <pre class='message__body'>Hello mouthpiece fans
I need a couple sheets of 2000 sandpaper. I don&#39;t want to have to buy 50 sheets and I live in an area where I can&#39;t find anything that fine. Can anybody contact me so as to sell and send me some? I would really appreciate it.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just searched around and found 10 sheets here:

Searching for "crocus cloth" also turns up some hits but you may not want a cloth.

I find anything finer than 600 (US-scale) = 1200 (P-scale) to be too fine for rail work.  I use "0000" steel wool for body finishing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Try any auto repair or parts shop.  They almost all carry 2000 and  even 
some 8000 grit wet or dry paper.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your replies. I live in a small town and the finest the only auto parts in town has is 1200 and the hardware 600. I do not drive and cant get into the city. I only need a couple sheets because it is a small job polishing up an ABS clarinet barrel. I was told by a serviceman of high repute that the best way to do it is with 2000 paper and oil so that is my plan. If someone could send me a couple sheets for $2 or $3 I would appreciate it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Smallparts.com is a convenient source for these types of products.  Under sandpaper you will find the 3M Light Blue Ultrafine 9 micron  paper that is the equivalent of 2000 grit.

If you are polishing a plastic clarinet barrel, you also might consider putting it snugly on the right size dowel, holding the dowel in a vise, and hand "ragging" it with a soft cloth using a fine metal polish. Just don&#39;t get too carried away and generate too much heat with the friction! When finished just wash it off and hit it with a coat of Pledge furniture polish and you have a nice finish.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi , Try an auto body shop or a fibregalass repair shop (R.V repair shop). They are likely to have 2000 grit.
