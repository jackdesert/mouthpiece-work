            <pre class='message__body'>Lots of folks have responded to specific videos, thanking Keith for taking the time to share his expertise, but I just went through the entire Dukoff reface series in one sitting, and all I have to say is - "Wow".  

Folks, you have to understand what it is Keith is providing here.  The six Dukoff videos are a master class on mouthpiece refacing; look at the previous videos and you have a full semester in graduate school.

Other people charge money for this level of information. I understand the market is limited, there is little profit selling stuff to mouthpiece tinkerers, but Keith is freely sharing his considerable experience; it&#39;s kind of like we&#39;re all his apprentice.  

Thank you Keith, I hope you keep posting videos, though I don&#39;t feel right asking for more, because you have already done so much.  You are an amazing human being.

I believe we all owe him a standing ovation for this, in my experience this is unprecedented.  I for one am devouring these videos like a little kid with a million bucks in a candy shop.

I'm really enjoying doing this kind of work, I'm really happy with my own
mouthpieces, and I have a growing list of very happy clients. Thanks, Keith.
And everyone else who's contributed knowledge here.

            <pre class='message__body'>I want to say thanks too! What Mojo has done is indeed really amazing - I don&#39;t think I ever would&#39;ve been able to even get started without all of the information he&#39;s compiled and freely shared on the web about his craft. It really is too cool. Thanks again Mojo!

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m just a padawan learning avidly the first steps, but I can say that I am learning a whole lot here and the road is just starting! This generosity of Mojo is really something rare, noble and beautiful. Thumbs up and big thanks, Keith!

I&#39;d like like to ask any other experienced user to make photos os a video of work routines, like "How to measure a mouthpiece", "how to check for table flatness" or "how to flatten a table", use of calipers, etc.

Thanks again Mojo!
P.
