Folks, you have to understand what it is Keith is providing here.  The six Dukoff videos are a master class on mouthpiece refacing; look at the previous videos and you have a full semester in graduate school.

Other people charge money for this level of information. I understand the market is limited, there is little profit selling stuff to mouthpiece tinkerers, but Keith is freely sharing his considerable experience; it&#39;s kind of like we&#39;re all his apprentice.  

Thank you Keith, I hope you keep posting videos, though I don&#39;t feel right asking for more, because you have already done so much.  You are an amazing human being.

I believe we all owe him a standing ovation for this, in my experience this is unprecedented.  I for one am devouring these videos like a little kid with a million bucks in a candy shop.

I'm really enjoying doing this kind of work, I'm really happy with my own
mouthpieces, and I have a growing list of very happy clients. Thanks, Keith.
And everyone else who's contributed knowledge here.

I&#39;d like like to ask any other experienced user to make photos os a video of work routines, like "How to measure a mouthpiece", "how to check for table flatness" or "how to flatten a table", use of calipers, etc.

Thanks again Mojo!
