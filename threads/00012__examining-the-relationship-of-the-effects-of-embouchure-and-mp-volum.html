            <pre class='message__body'>It seems to me that one of the key elements to understanding the
practical application of Benade&#39;s two requirements for a conical
woodwind to "play properly" is to determine if a change in one has a one
to one ratio with a change in the other.

For those not familiar with Benade&#39;s two requirements, they are as
follows:  (1) The effective volume of the mouthpiece must closely match
the volume of the "missing cone".  (2) The calculated frequency of the
missing cone + the neck must closely replicate the played frequency of
the mouthpiece on the neck.

Some ideas I want to try are as follows:

Given that the straight cylindrical tube used in the mouthpiece
effective volume study has a stable and easily controlled pitch, I would
propose.

a)  Playing the mouthpiece on the tube at a marked  spot with a normal
embouchure and recording the pitch to get a base frequency.

b)  Playing the mouthpiece in the same position with an embouchure so
tight as to almost close off the reed and record the pitch.

c)  Playing with the same tight embouchure as (b) pull the mouthpiece
off the cork until the pitch drops back down to that of (a) and measure
that distance on the cork.

d)  Return the mouthpiece to the starting position in (a) and using a
normal embouchure move the mouthpiece on to the cork until the higher
pitch  of  (b) is achieved.

Measuring the distance moved on the cork going from (b) to (c)  should
indicate the mouthpiece effective volume lost by tightening the
embouchure to effect pitch change X

Measuring the distance moved on the cork going from (a) to (d) should
indicate the mouthpiece effective volume lost by moving the mouthpiece
on the cork that distance to effect pitch change X.

If this theory is correct, these two measurements can point to
mouthpiece volume relationship between moving the mouthpiece on the cork
and  changing the embouchure pressure and see whether they have a one to
one ratio or are slightly disproportionate.

If indeed they are found to be slightly disproportionate, that is great
news since that means that the volume requirement and the Frs
requirement can both be accurately met by adjusting both the placement
of the mouthpiece and the embouchure setting.  Anyway, this is how I see
it.  Does anyone else have any suggestions?

            <pre class='message__body'>I am bumping this thread since the discussion kind of got side tracked when it was originally posted.  Following through on the previous discussions about mouthpiece volume and Frs, I believe that this could be a very important element in understanding the effects of mouthpiece pitch in playing a woodwind instrument.

Hopefully, I will have the time this weekend to record some data using the following procedure.  When I do I will post it on my website.
