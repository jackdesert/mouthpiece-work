Hi...... I am new to this group and to refacing. I am reading and watching all I can about it. Before I invest in a lot of tools, where is the best place to buy what I need and where can I download the Excel files that I see? I will be working on my 2 daughters clarinet and saxophone mouthpieces. They are in 10th and 11th grade symphonic and marching band......... Thanks, Bob</pre>

Check the Files section on the Mouthpiece Work Yahoo Group Site.  Has facing curve spreadsheets and lists of tools and suppliers.

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not have a smart phone so I can not see what you see.  Try clicking on "More" to find the Files section. 

I doubt you will be able to use the spreadsheet on a smart phone anyhow.
