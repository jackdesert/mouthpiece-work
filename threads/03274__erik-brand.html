            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
I bought the original reprinted copy of this manual, I payd it a bit 
but I found it very useful. Unfortunately as you probably know the 
original E. Brand kit is unavailable at this time. It should contain 
the original manual or better It should contain the section regarding 
the mouthpiece refacing techniques and several facing curves which 
unfortunately are not included in the copy I bought.
Can someone help me in finding these curves?
Thanks a lot,

Dan
