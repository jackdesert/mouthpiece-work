I have a customer who has a white Brilhart 5* with serial number that has a chunk broken off of the corner of the tip.  Who do you recommend to send it to for repair???
 
Thank you!!

I have a cream color epoxy given to me by JVW to experiment with.  It is
smelly to work with and he did not care for it.  I&#39;ve used it once on a
Personaline bite plate and it was OK.  I dont know how it would work out on
a tip corner.

To match the creamy white color, consider a local Dentist.  They may be
able to build it up with dental epoxy correctly tinted to match.  Then
you
can pick the refacer of your choice.

I have a cream color epoxy given to me by JVW to experiment with.  It is
smelly to work with and he did not care for it.  I&#39;ve used it once on a
Personaline bite plate and it was OK.  I dont know how it would work out

a tip corner.
