            <pre class='message__body'>To match the creamy white color, consider a local Dentist.  They may be
able to build it up with dental epoxy correctly tinted to match.  Then you
can pick the refacer of your choice.

I have a cream color epoxy given to me by JVW to experiment with.  It is
smelly to work with and he did not care for it.  I&#39;ve used it once on a
Personaline bite plate and it was OK.  I dont know how it would work out on
a tip corner.

            <pre class='message__body'>Try liquid steel epoxy, this works well on the edges of the tip to fill,
file and return to flush. It will even do large chips too.
