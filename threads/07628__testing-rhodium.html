            <pre class='message__body'>Theo started a rumor on his site that Florida Links have a layer of Rhodium under the Gold.  But he says "(nickel)" in the same sentence.

I had Emailed Theo a while back on this and he said he did not have any proof.

I have a client who says he has access to an EDS and x-ray tester in a lab.  So he may offer some insight soon.

I have been tempted to try one of these Pen Gold Testers.

But I&#39;m not sure I want to shell out $35 for it.  It only has a 1-year shelf life.  Does anyone have one to try on a FL Link plating? Most of them have the gold layer worn off.

            <pre class='message__body'>Interesting idea if somebody can actually do a proper test.  FWIW, my more elementary chemical analysis (eyeball comparison to my rhodium plated wedding ring, and a nickel) says my Florida is most likely nickel plated, not rhodium.

            <pre class='message__body'>Maybe the next time I get one sent in I&#39;ll call around to some local jewelers to see if any of them have the pen or the acid test.
