            <pre class='message__body'>I refaced a short shank soloist tenor mouthpiece and it actually sounds quite nice.  The problem i am having is that when i try to take more mouthpiece it becomes very squeaky and squeals a lot and has a bright and tinny character.  I know that this happens to all mouthpieces when you take too much but in this situation i cant even take the amount i would usually take, it only plays well if i play close to the tip.  Also i find i have to apply more pressure on the reed.  Is this because of the facing curve or the baffle shape?  Has anyone else come across this problem and found any remedies?  I&#39;m not quite sure how to approach this problem.

Double check the table and curve, lower the baffle.

            <pre class='message__body'>Often if you open the facing, you end up with a lot of baffle material just behind the tip rail. If you find that the rails are balanced, I suggest that you take down the baffle immediately behind the tip rail, from the actual edge of the tip rail back a couple of mm. You can even cut a rather
 deep groove at this point. I did this and it greatly improved a high-baffle Beechler Bellite which I had refaced but which still wanted to squeak and squeal with a relaxed embouchure. This should (or at least can) greatly improve response and stop the tendency of the mpc to chirp and squeak
 without greatly affecting the tone. There is a great difference between bright and "on the edge of squealing". If the mpc is still too bright after removing material from behind the tip rail continue back and take the first five mm of the baffle down somewhat.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d check for an even facing right at the very end of the facing, i.e. At
the corners of the tip rail... A bit hard to do unless you have a feeler
gauge that&#39;s just the right thickness. Can be done with a tip gauge,
although this is also dicey unless the tip gauge has a sharp tip so you can
see where it&#39;s touching (best to measure several times, in order to be sure,
as you&#39;re eyeballing the tip placement).

I&#39;ve also found (as mentioned by Toby) that the baffle just behind the tip
rail is usually a bit too high after refacing, but not that it tends to
cause squealing - rather I find that a mouthpiece becomes more free-blowing
after it&#39;s taken down. There is a point of diminishing returns on this as
well.

A bump in the baffle a bit further behind the tip rail does make mouthpieces
brighter, sometimes tinny if overdone - the so-called rollover baffle, IIRC.
