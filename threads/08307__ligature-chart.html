            <pre class='message__body'>On my Link STM tenor I use a Rovner Eddie Daniels (now replaced by a "new" model which appears to be essentially the same but renamed -- "Versa" or something).  I know they make one that wil fit the alto as well.  That model combines the best features of the Rovners and the Bonades.
