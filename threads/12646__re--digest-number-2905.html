Thanks for forwarding this thread.  I am a member of that group and I have skimmed through but I was on vacation all last week so I haven&#39;t read it thoroughly.  I will look over again.
On another note, I invite you to keep an eye on my website as I am redoing it and offer some new products as well.  The redo should be ready for public in a couple of weeks.
Best,
Brad

There was a horror story floating around just last week about a fellow who played the bagpipes and died from a lung infection traced to bacteria in the bag of his instrument.  That stirred a flurry of wind instrument cleanings around here.

             I checked this with my filament supplier. 





 He explained that the problem is not the material used but the fact that 3D printing causes microscopic small spaces in the object that can be a breeding place for bacteria coming from saliva. 


 





 There is anti bacterial PLA on the market but that works only for two years.


 





 I don&#39;t know how true that is for mouthpieces. I think the supplier bases his opinion on the answers he has to give on questions about food safety. Maybe it is different for mp&#39;s and maybe there is a way to treat 3D printed mouthpieces safe?

Since we don&#39;t store food in mouthpieces, one can argue that food

safety regs shouldn&#39;t apply - although I suppose if one encounters

bureaucrats looking to make trouble, sweet reason may not prevail. 



In

any case, inasmuch as these are bacteria that are *already* living in

the mouth, I don&#39;t see why this should be a problem for an individual&#39;s

mouthpiece. 



As far as selling 3D printed mouthpieces that you&#39;ve had

in your mouth during final adjustment, a germicide soak should suffice.

Bleach. Cetylcide. Ethylene oxide if you can find some place to do it

and are super serious about sterilization.

             seriously, folks……saxophone mouthpieces are just not something we need to get OSHA or the nanny state involved with……

This article was mentioned in MedPageToday, which I get. The
bagpiper died of a severe lung inflammation due to exposure to molds and
fungi present in the instrument bag (not bacteria). Not an infection,
rather an out of control inflammation response. 

The article had links
to a similar incidents in a saxophonist (not fatal; posted below) and a
trombonist.

Chest. 2010
Sep;138(3):724-6. doi: 10.1378/chest.09-2991.
Hypersensitivity
pneumonitis due to molds in a saxophone player.
Metzger F1, Haccuria A,
Reboux G, Nolard N, Dalphin JC, De Vuyst P.
1Department of Respiratory
Disease, Jean Minjoz University Hospital, Besançon, France. 

This
48-year-old patient was evaluated for an interstitial pneumonia. An
open-lung biopsy showed a pattern of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.
The CT scan appearance, showing mosaic ground-glass opacities in the
ventilated parts of the lung, the centrolobular predominance of
inflammation on the lung sections, and the presence of a lymphocytic
alveolitis at BAL suggested a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The patient
was a white-collar worker and had no contact with pets, birds, drugs, or
molds at home. He used to play the saxophone as a hobby. Two molds,
Ulocladium botrytis and Phoma sp, were detected in the saxophone.
Precipitating antibodies to these molds were present in his serum. An
additional study confirmed the frequent colonization of saxophones with
potentially pathogenic molds, such as Fusarium sp, Penicillium sp, and
Cladosporium sp. Respiratory physicians should be aware of the risk of
hypersensitivity pneumonitis in saxophone or perhaps other wind
instrument players.

By the way, those that admonish posters to trim their posts, I don't have the opportunity to do that.  When I reply I get a blank window to type in, with a Send button at the bottom.
