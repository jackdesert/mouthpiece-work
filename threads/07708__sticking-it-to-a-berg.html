            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve just refaced a crappy old Berg Larsen metal alto mouthpiece 85/2 SMS, got it playing pretty good.  The bite plate has been stuck on kinda wonky and is starting to come away on one side.  Just wondering what kind of glue you guys would recommend to stick it back on straight?

Was thinking of remounting it using a 2 part epoxy glue such as Araldite, but maybe there is something better / safer?

Use the gel or thick viscosity type CA ("super glue") adhesives.

            <pre class='message__body'>Superglues (cyanoacrylates) don&#39;t contain any BPA--they are totally inert after curing. Try using a gum type made for plastics.
