Why did yahoo change the display pages of the group ? OK I can learn
to live with that, if it still worked. I have been methodically
trawling through the MESSAGES from 1 to 2000+ and hoping to catch up
eventually.
Now, when I input a message # request, up comes a random selection of
posts covering months, not days with no relevance to the # entered in
the SEARCH MESSAGES box. Has anyone else had this problem and can it
be fixed. I am suffering withdrawel symptoms already :(

            <pre class='message__body'>Yahoo periodically updates their services.  I have no control over them
other than configuring a few options they allow.  Bugs and glitches are
usually worked out in a few days.  I do not even know where to report
problems to.

There is a link on the new home page layout to send feedback to 
Yahoo.  I forwarded your comment to them.
