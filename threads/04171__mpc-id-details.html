            <pre class='message__body'>I will apologize in advance if this is too far off the group purpose,
but this is where a very large collection of the right kind of
expertise is gathered.

I am looking to understand vintage mouthpieces a bit better.  I have
looked through mouthpiece heaven and saxmouthpiece.com ... but they do
not go as far as I would like to see.

For instance:  What is the meaning of the offsets in some of the Berg
Larsen markings?  And what is the difference between Otto Links marked
"Super" Tone Master and others that are Super Tone Master - other than
the missing quotation marks?  Why is there a tall 9* next to
ToneMaster on some NY links, when the facing (nowhere near a 9*) is
marked on the table?  etc. etc. etc.

If I can gather enough information I may start a website devoted to
information re. vintage mouthpiece history and identification.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ciao Edwdard,
 the website you mentioned are a good place to catch informations.
 If you want to built a site too... first you have to know that the difference are so many, sometimes even the manufacturer have no more reference...
 
 ...an example: One day I have seen for sell a Barone mouthpiece without the usual number, so I start to suppose thinks like... it was difective, Phil didnt sign because was not perfect, no it was good but was a direct order of someone, and so on. Then I asked him and he told me simply... on that time I got accident with a car and I felt bad... maybe I forgot, I&#39;m not sure. You like to play it? So play it!
 
 Anyway any interesting info you can get in many blog and forum, especially on SOTW, for sure you know. The mouthpieceWork discussions are usually more technical than... where is the number on my Link? But there is very nice people related to this site starting from the owner Mr.Mojo or Keith, a gently available person. 
 Good luck for your site... and dont forget the address. See also my SML site at www.bebopitalia.com
 
 ciao. Gian

            <pre class='message__body'>I think this is a noble effort.  I would suggest starting with a site with
pictures of all the various mouthpieces, particularly those over 25 years
old.  Then you should try to get as many first hand accounts of their
history as you can.  You are dealing with mostly an oral history here. 
There are very few detailed vintage catalogs out there to help.  Doc Tenney
may help answer some of the really tough questions.

Whatever info I have has been gleaned off the web.  I would speculate that
Theo&#39;s info is from the many clients that have visited him in person.  They
probably said "I got this piece from... in the year..." and he noted it. 
With eBay, these pieces are swapping around a lot faster and we are losing
the info that the original owner had.

I could supply some pictures as the pieces pass over my bench.  You can
also snag them off eBay over time.
