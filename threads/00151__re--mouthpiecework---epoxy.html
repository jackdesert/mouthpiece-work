            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Jon, I&#39;d like to try the epoxy.  

I know what you mean about the fast set stuff.  I&#39;ve been making some
baffles out of a 5-min set plumbers&#39; epoxy putty ("Oakey", I think) from
Home Depot.  I tried to do 2 mouthpieces at the same time, but no way.  I
can barely form one as it hardens.  But I like it better than waiting
around for the slower stuff to set.  

I know you are busy and focusing on your work.

I&#39;ll send you my address.

the whole group.  As you may have figured out, he has some cream 
colored epoxy that sets too fast for his liking.  He was going to
