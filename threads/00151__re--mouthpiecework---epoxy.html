            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Jon, I&#39;d like to try the epoxy.  

I know what you mean about the fast set stuff.  I&#39;ve been making some
baffles out of a 5-min set plumbers&#39; epoxy putty ("Oakey", I think) from
Home Depot.  I tried to do 2 mouthpieces at the same time, but no way.  I
can barely form one as it hardens.  But I like it better than waiting
around for the slower stuff to set.  

I know you are busy and focusing on your work.

I&#39;ll send you my address.

            <pre class='message__body'>Whoops.  Jon Van Wie sent me a private message that I thought went to 
the whole group.  As you may have figured out, he has some cream 
colored epoxy that sets too fast for his liking.  He was going to 
toss it, but offered to send it to me.
