            <pre class='message__body'>How much smaller is a C clarinet moutpiece than a Bb one? Redwine Jazz sells many models in AD2, which is 2 mm shorter than the standard AD0 models. Their service is excellent.

            <pre class='message__body'>2 mm might do it. The Bb mouthpiece that I made for the C clarinet is
smaller by about 3 mm than the C Clarinet mouthpiece to make up for the bore
difference and seems to work fine for pitch throughout the horn.

 

I will try cutting one down 2 mm and see if that is enough. I know many
people play on a Bb mouthpiece and bite like crazy or use a really hard reed
to make up for the difference. My Noblet C Clarinet mouthpiece that Glen
Johnston refaced 30 years ago works perfectly. Wish I could find a stack of
those. It is a big hassle to cut a mouthpiece down. I am looking to have
some C mouthpieces in stock as I have had 2 calls this week for a pre-made C
mouthpiece. I know, that&#39;s strange.  

 

I guess I better contact Mr. Redwine and see if he gives a wholesale price
to the trade.

 

 

Thanks
