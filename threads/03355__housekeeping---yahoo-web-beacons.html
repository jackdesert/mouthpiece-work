            <pre class='message__body'>Housekeeping - Yahoo Web Beacons (I know not about Mpc&#39;s but I did 
some research on why using Yahoo lead to so much Spam)

As a "free" service Yahoo Groups sells ads, some which include Web 
Beacons.

You can opt out (if you only receive the List Email is this not an 
issue):

If you use Yahoo this is an issue you should look at and decide if you 
want to opt out of (recommended).
