It&#39;s definitely not hard rubber - which has a characteristic odor when one
works on it.

I was unable to find anything definitive googling around.

It FEELS like and works like a very polymerized nylon of some kind - it has
a kind of slickness, and seems to have a certain amount of give and
toughness, doesn&#39;t chip. It is a bit harder to work on than hard rubber, but
not impossible.

However, they seem to have solved the problem of "plastic memory", i.e. the
difficulty encountered trying to make precision parts out of such materials
(if you have some stresses within the material it tends to distort over
time).

This may be so today, but back in 1987 Graftonite was listed as a
