            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I was trying out some mouthpieces at a local music store, and
to my delight, a Vandoren V16 T95 that I tried was making all
the right noises that I go for.  It&#39;s kind of a cross between
a Link and a Guardala: the inner side walls are vertical from
the tip to about .75 inch, then are scooped out like a Guardala.
The baffle is rolled over but still pretty high near the tip,
not high enough to cause chirping or squeaking. The chamber is 
wide open, the tip opening about .116".  The only thing I don&#39;t
like is the mpc is a little too narrow for my tastes (not as
narrow as a Guardala), but it really lets me express my musical
ideas with almost no hesitation.  And it&#39;s plenty loud on gigs.
There was another mpc there of the same make and model, but
I didn&#39;t like how it played as much -- may have something to do
with the region at the tip rail / side rail intersection, that
was a little different between them.  It is kind of hard on
reeds though, they usually last maybe 3 gigs before giving up
the ghost.  The mpc came with a facing chart, measured from this
exact mpc, measured in mm from the end vs. 0.01mm opening.

mm from tip   opening in 0.01 mm
-----------   ------------------
0              295
2              252
4.8            200
7.9            150
9.9            120
12.3            90
15.2            60
17.5            40
19.9            25
25.8             4
30               0

I have not run these numbers through any analysis to figure
out curve radii, etc... but it&#39;s cool that this was included
with the mpc.  I&#39;m NOT getting paid for an endorsement here,
just sharing info about a cool mpc.  I hope to have my own
ready for prime time in a few years.

I&#39;m now playing more than working on mpcs, but that will
probably reverse again after a while. :-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Ken,
That is neat that you were supplied with facing curve measurements.  Is
this something the retailer did or does it look like it came from Vandoren?

            <pre class='message__body'>Definitely from the Vandoren factory.  I wish they&#39;d 
included baffle, rail, and window dimensions as well,
but it&#39;s a start.  :-)
