            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all-

My first post but I am thankful for the info here.  I usually work on links (STMs for my own use) and have become comfortable closing the tip moderately by taking down the table.  I can then apply the curve to my preferences (22mm) without necessarily having to do any work on the baffle.

What is the best approach to close the tip (from a 7* to a 7 or 6*) if there is not enough material on the table?

Thanks!

Matt

            <pre class='message__body'>In all the modern Links I&#39;ve seen there&#39;s way too much material in the table.  I have never had a problem with not enough, except in a few butchered vintage STMs.  You&#39;re only talking about taking off another .005" anyway.  that said, if you have to you can try bending the tip closed, but this will create a bit of a low spot in the facing curve, so you&#39;ll have to overshoot it then open it up again past the bend.  

I would just lap the table down.  If it starts to fail, it will get razor thin at the window edge.  It&#39;ll be thicker as you go back toward the heel.  Lengthen the window some and/or reinforce it underneath with some solder.  I have never had to do this to a modern STM, though, there&#39;s usually enough table to safely take off around 1mm by hand.

Thanks Morgan.  This piece is a Barone Jazz and the table is awfully thin as it is.  I think bending the tip is beyond my skill level at this point.  I&#39;ll try your second suggestion first.

Again, thanks.
