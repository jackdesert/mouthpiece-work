I wrote "Dave" at East Coast Winds and he said he would get some pictures
of his method to me.  Hasn&#39;t happened yet.  He did say in an Email that he
takes readings every 1 mm (probably into the chamber/bore).  I guess he
gets X,Y coordinates and plots them on a computer.  Sound like a good way
to go.

There are some expensive 3D digitizers out there, but I&#39;m looking for a low
cost method.  I&#39;d like to draw some of these before I sell them off.

I started experimenting with adapting an old Pantograph to draw the
profile.  I replaced the tracer pointer with a U-shaped probe that reaches
into the mouthpiece, but is still in line with the original tracer axis. 
The rig is kind of rickety, but I think I can work the bugs out.  Next I
need a better clamp to hold down the mouthpiece without getting in the way.
