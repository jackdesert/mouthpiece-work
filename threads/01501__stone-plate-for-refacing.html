            <pre class='message__body'>Where can you get a piece of stone for refacing? 

I read that Morgan likes to use black onyx, Marble might be good, 
too.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a 9x2x12 hunk of granite that&#39;s certified flat within .0001". 
Got it from Lee Valley Tools in Toronto for $40 CDN. It&#39;s a bit heavy 
if you want a portable setup...

            <pre class='message__body'>I think McMaster-Carr has Granite bases in several sizes.  Shipping might
be expensive unless you can find one locally.

easy!

BTW - It&#39;s a heay little bugger to carry from place to place but if
you are not moving it very much, it is the best way to go.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have only done a very small amount of mouthpiece touchup, but I do 
resurface my machine cutting tools (I build custom furniture). I have 
always used float glass...gravity makes it very flat. I have a glass 
shop cut me a piece of 1/2" and grind the edges like a table top with 
a radius or bevel. I have a number of these and they only cost $8-
10...I stick on rubber feet and they are very stable. Any reason 
these shouldn&#39;t work for serious mouthpiece work?
