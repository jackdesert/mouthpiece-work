            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Keith, 

 

 The links works, thanks for that I really appreciate it. But how would I accurately measure tip openings of clarinet mouthpieces with the caliper? The internal measuring jaws don't seem to fit in between the glass and the clarinet mouthpiece.. I have been trying to use the depth measuring blade to measure the tip opening, but I keep getting different readings each time I measure. Today's readings with the depth blade has been alot more consistent than yesterday but it would be great if anyone knows of a better way of doing it.
 

 

 Cheers,

            <pre class='message__body'>I don't know how to accurately measure tip opening with a dial caliper.  I use one of several 
depth gauges with a fixture that lays against the table, and holds the gauge so that its 
probe touches the tip rail.

I have two of the Theo Wanne fixtures, with digital gauges purchased from a member here.

I have a similar one one from a refacing kit by John Winslow with a dial gauge.

            <pre class='message__body'>The inside caliper jaws should fit to measure clarinet mouthpiece tip openings.  If not, you can file down the caliper jaws on the outside to make then thinner.

If the mouthpiece table is convex, you will not get consistent results with any gauge.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everyone, 

 

 

 When I'm sanding mouthpieces and filing my calipers, is it necessary that I wear a dust mask? And lastly, where in the house is usually the safest place to do this kind of work? I've never done anything like this before so I don't know all the basic safety rules and stuff. 
 

 Cheers,
