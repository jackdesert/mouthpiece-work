            <pre class='message__body'>Check to see if the table is flat and where the initial measurement
starts. This will be were your problem is.

I have a brass Lawton 8*BB tenor mouthpiece that plays well except 
for the low register,Bb1-D1 are very hard to play when played out 
loud (subtoning is no problem).These notes don&#39;t pop out easy at 
all.The tip is around .115 and my set-up is not extreme,LaVoz mediums

            <pre class='message__body'>What is the facing length?  If the facing is very short, or if it is not 
a smooth curve, there can be difficulty with the low notes.  I have seen 
some Levelair * facing mouthpieces with a bizarre facing contour, a 
sharp radius at the break, and from there out to the tip nearly flat.  
Changing to a smooth curve really improves these pieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>You can run your thumb along the side rails of most Level Airs and feel a
kink in the middle of the facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Paul,

I don&#39;t have proper tools to measure the facing but I checked with 
reeds and the facing does not seem very short to me.However,the 
facing seems to be quite flat after the break,not really a smooth 
curve.Maybe thats the problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve seen a few Lawtons.  None of them have had short facings.  They were
all medium-long.  There&#39;s a chart of Lawton facing lengths on the Bill
Lewington UK site.
