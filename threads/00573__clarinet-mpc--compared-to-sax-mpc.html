Why do used sax mouthpieces demand such a high resale price and used 
clarinet pieces go for $15? The new prices for clarinet pieces are 
comparable to the new prices of saxophone pieces. 

My answer is that while the clarinet player is satisfied not to 
search; the saxophone player is never satisfied (and that keeps the 
market up) he wants to buy every other brand or model mouthpiece out 
there, to experience the "FEEL"!! 

Also why is there such a hype on the need for the "special sax piece" 
and clarinet players are mostly content with the generic? 

BTW: what is the design theory with the clarinet piece that makes it 
unsuitable for the saxophone (besides the obvious method of 
attachment)? 

Don&#39;t say that the clarinet piece is designed for a straight bore 
instrument and the saxophone piece is designed for a conical 
instrument. I would like to know what this design difference is in 
actual shape and feature and why does this make the saxophone piece 
such a mystery; that we saxophone players have a never ending search 
for one that works right!! 

I heard of a Jazz player that fitted a clarinet mouthpiece to his sax 
and played it great! Explain that one.

sax, but I cannot locate the post. Doc, if you are out there can you

            <pre class='message__body'>Clarinet mouthpieces are a mystery to me.  I have put nice facings on them,
but chamber work seems not to be the same as on sax.  Different goals,
different ways to get it.

Part of the difference in the mouthpiece search quest is often a sax player
is looking for a non-conservative sound.  There are many of them for sax. 
Clarinet players for the most part are looking for a classical sound. 
There are very few of them on clarinet.

It would be nice to get the clarinet mouthpiece makers to elighten us some
on clarinet mouthpieces.

That story was posted by Doc on SOTW.

Doc is aware of this forum but probably does not want to post here 
because the way this group is set up, you need to supply an Email 
address to post.  He does not want to have a public Email address.

I have contemplated removing the Email address requirement for this 
group, but I think it is best left as is.  One could always use a new 
Hotmail or Yahoo Email address, but it would still be a mild hassle 
to set-up and maintain.

So far, I have only had to ban a couple of spammers.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Tom,

I play clarinet, and I can&#39;t think of many other
clarinetists that use a generic mouthpiece - if, by
generic, you mean the one that comes with the horn. 
We&#39;re searching for the holy grail of mouthpieces too!
 There are always a few vintage pieces on eBay that
people will fork several hundred dollars for.

Somebody mentioned there being a narrower range of
sounds for classical clarinet playing and that might
be right.  Since sax players probably play more jazz,
they have a more diverse pallette of tones to work
with.

            <pre class='message__body'>Pure speculation but, doubling apart, as a rule sax players fall into more
categories, eg, classical, jazz (mainstream and modern), R&B, pop, often
with a need to be versatile for commercial work.

On the other hand clarinetists are generally either classical or early jazz.
There seems to be a defined "standard ideal" classical tone which may vary
through the ages but is more to do with vibrato than pure sound.

On the other hand, rather than there being an "ideal" jazz saxophone sound,
originality is often the aim, be it sound, feel, or technique.

So basically sax players like to dick around with mouthpieces.

I did know a trad clarinetist in Sheffield who took up soprano and played it
very nicely with a clarinet mouthpiece.

  i think the obvious difference derives from the acoustical properties of the instruments; there is, i believe, a large diffence in the partials found in a saxophone tone production as opposed to clarinet, the saxophone producing a tone with a complicated partial structure thus giving rise to greater variety in sound. am i way off base here? mdc

    On the other hand clarinetists are generally either classical or early jazz.
    There seems to be a defined "standard ideal" classical tone which may vary
    through the ages but is more to do with vibrato than pure sound.

    On the other hand, rather than there being an "ideal" jazz saxophone sound,
    originality is often the aim, be it sound, feel, or technique.

    So basically sax players like to dick around with mouthpieces.

    I did know a trad clarinetist in Sheffield who took up soprano and played it
    very nicely with a clarinet mouthpiece.
