            <pre class='message__body'>Epoxy does not adhere well to either the metal or the plastic.  Use E6000 or Alene&#39;s
7800.  These are in the craft department of Walmart, or craft and hobby stores such
as Michael&#39;s.  Paul

What should I use to re-attach Bite Plate 
I have a vintage fat body Berg tenor piece and the bite plate is in 
good condition, but fell out. I want to glue it back in, but am not 
sure what to use. I just bought some 5 minute Epoxy. Should I use 
that or something else.


Thanks in Advance

            <pre class='message__body'>Epoxy is brittle, does not glue well to metal long term.

I like E6000, an SBR adhesive (styrene butadyene rubber).  A little will 
ooze out when you put in the bite place, let it.  After it is dry scrape 
off the excess with your fingernail.

You may also use a gel type CA adhesive.
