for one would certainly welcome his knowledge and expertise, if only to
drop in occasionally and set all of us amateurs straight on a given

He sounded a bit non-committal when asked if he would like to participate in an online acoustic discussion, but we&#39;ll see where it goes when he gets back to me.

Since he was a student of Benade and actually makes a living using acoustic theory followed by empirical testing to make woodwinds play better, I hope he is treated with respect by all of this forum&#39;s participants if and when he joins the discussion.

I once asked Joe Wolfe whether one of his grad students might wish to join our SOTW discussions, but not surprisingly he was noncommittal, considering what a time sink these things are.

  I just got off the phone with Jim. He is still at the same address. Surprisingly he doesn&#39;t have a computer or internet connection at this time. However, he said he would have one in two months after his daughter has her baby. I left him my email address and he said he would get back in touch when he gets the computer.

            <pre class='message__body'>Is he really "professional" or is he just a repairman? I haven&#39;t seen  
anything about publications or real experience. I think we should be  
very cautious about the qualifications of "experts" in this day of the  
internet....a lot of guys have just popped up out of nowhere and said  
they are experts on a variety of topics, and when you start looking  
for meaningful accomplishments, there are none to be found.

I have not met Jim and don&#39;t have any axe to grind with him, and am  
more than willing to listen and learn from what he has to say. I just  
contend that if someone is being held out as an expert, let&#39;s see the  
cards on the table face up, please. If we&#39;re going to bring in an  
expert, let&#39;s bring in a real expert who has done something in the  
field that is recognized by the industry.

There was some guy last year (from the UK) who posted in the  
mouthpiece group about all the consulting he had done and his great  
expertise. I asked the man who has his name on the building of one of  
the companies this dude claimed to have worked for, and he told me HE  
HAD NEVER HEARD OF HIM......makes you want to go "hmmmmmmm"

The internet is full of self appointed experts, with no portfolio but  
a lot of claims of expertise. This group needs to be careful.

            <pre class='message__body'>For those who are not familiar with Jim Gebler.  He worked alongside
Arthur Benade for 2 years in the 1970s at Case Western University and
remained a close friend of both Arthur and his wife Virginia until
Arthur&#39;s death in 1987.  Arthur Benade includes Jim Gebler in the
credits to his book "The Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics the most
widely used text on the subject, and a cornerstone of the writings in
musical acoustics. Jim&#39;s work on several woodwind projects is noted in
several places throughout the text.

Jim wrote a three part series in the Woodwind Quarterly entitled
"Diagnosing Woodwind Bores".  He has also written articles on instrument
repair for the Music Educator&#39;s Journal.

He and Benade collaborated in a study entitled "Reed cavity and neck
proportions in conical woodwinds" cited in the Journal of the Acoustic
Society of America in 1973.

Jim and his wife currently own and operate the Fine Band Instrument
Repair Shop in Guilford Connecticut and is highly regarded by top
woodwind players all over the country for his skill in diagnosing and
correcting acoustic deficiencies in high end woodwinds as well as his
artistry in repair.

Jim is the "real deal" who has not only the scientific background in
acoustics, but the real world experience of knowing how to apply that
knowledge to the instruments that come across his bench.

He would be a great addition to this forum, if his schedule permits, and
again I hope that he is shown the respect and courtesy a man of his
experience and credentials is due.
