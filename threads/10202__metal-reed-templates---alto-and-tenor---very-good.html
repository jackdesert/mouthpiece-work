I am glad you are on top of these things. I don&#39;t use reed templates a lot
but when I need them they are very valuable. Especially if a client has
dropped a mouthpiece on the tip and it needs to be rebuilt.

            <pre class='message__body'>I designed these templates from several reeds I had on hand.  Mostly Ricos and Vandorens.  If I had different shapes, I did something in between.  The templates are symmetric.  Most cane and synthetic reeds are not.
 
If these do not match reeds you like to use, you can file and send the edges to customize them as you wish.  Or just use cane reeds as templates.  (Though they are not as sturdy.)
