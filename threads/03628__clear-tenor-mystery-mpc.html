            <pre class='message__body'>Could use some help identifying the brand of an old acrylic tenor 
mouthpiece.

I posted 3 pictures of it to the photos section in a folder titled 
the same as the subject.

The only marking on it aside from the tape is a "2" on the table.  
It&#39;s all original - tip around .068" w/ a 42 facing length.  Plays 
very nicely.  Straight sidewalls to the chamber - kinda built and 
plays like a Brilhart.  Tight, smallish shank bore.  Maybe someone 
recognizes the shank design?

This piece is part of a collection from a gentleman who passed away 
about a month ago.  It may have been bought at late as the 1970&#39;s, 
but he was a long time player - back into the 1930&#39;s.  Based on the 
rest of his collection.

Anyone care to weigh in?  Thanks.

- Ed

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Ed is correct, a Runyon 22.  That shank looks like the mold 
section they used for the Conn Precision.  The Runyon 22 was also the 
basis of the Conn Precision, King, and several other stock mouthpieces, 
with only the shank section being changed to give a different appearance.
