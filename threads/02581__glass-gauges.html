            <pre class='message__body'>I would recommend getting one of the mm gages.  I have not heard of anyone
using the 1/32" gage.

With the "set back" gage, the zero line of the scale is 1/8" away from the
edge of the glass.  You need to zero the scale by eye to the mouthpiece
tip.  

With the "end grad" gage the zero line is the edge of the glass.  This
allow you to mechanically zero the gage with the tip against some type of
"stop".  Some use the edge of a work table or the edge of a granite slab
they are using.

They used to offer narrow and wide versions of the gage.  They may all be
wide now.

I think the mechanical zeroing is a good idea, but I have never owned one
of the "end grad" gages.  With good technique, either gage works fine.  

I have never seen the Babbitt tip wand.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ralph, First, for the glass gauge you want mm, not 1/32".  Almost 
universally facings are measured with various feelers and the numbers 
given in mm&#39;s or half mm&#39;s (Eric Brand system).  The increments are 
appropriate for our work.
 
Next, there are two types of gauges, ones that are set back, and ones 
that the zero is the end of the glass.  I just don&#39;t know how to 
consistently and quickly line up the tip with the zero line of a set 
back gauge.
 
But for a zero end gauge I simply place the glass on the mouthpiece, 
hold it so that the table is horizontal, and press gently against the 
vertical face of the edge of my workbench, letting them slide until 
mouthpiece tip and glass touch the workbench. 
 
With this method I can quickly align the glass, measure with feelers, 
adjust the facing, remeasure, and have consistent, meaningful results.
 
The tip gauge is a tapered rod, flat on one side, round on the other.  
This is slipped between the aligned glass and mouthpiece tip, with the 
round side touching the tip rail (so that it only touches the tip rail 
at one point), the flat side toward the glass.  It is slid in gently 
until it stops, and the measurement read from the flat side of the tip 
gauge.

            <pre class='message__body'>Using a set back gage, I feel that I can get a repeatable zero within .2
numbers on the scale by eye.   For .2 = .1 mm = .004", this is about the
width of the lines etched in the gage.

For a .100" tip opening, this amount of error translates into ~ +/- 2.25
degrees when trying to hold an edge zero gage and mouthpiece tip against a
flat edge.   ATAN(.004/.100) = 2.29 degs

With a 90 deg fixture, like Springer uses, it should be possible to do
better than +/- 1 deg for outstanding zero repeatablity.

To deal with my small repeatablity error, I try to take an entire set of
measurements at once and plot them to see the shape of the facing curve. 
But when roughing in a facing, I do spot checks and get along fine.

both give me the same answers, but the wand requires more skill as you
