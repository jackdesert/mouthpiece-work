            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

My question: Are there concerns when I set-up my equip that certain brand
mpc brand is more compatible with certain brand saxophone due to the
internal bore size dimension relation of the mpc, neck and body of the sax?

I have come across expressions from repair tech that certain brand sax are
medium bore to medium large bore and was wondering whether this directly
involves choosing a mpc for a particular sax.

My equipt: Baritone Mk 6 with Low A Lacq with JSchmidt grey pads. Yanagisawa
(Prima) B6 Low A (to be overhaul soon). Mpcs RPC .125 Medium baffle, Lawton
brass lacq 5* B and 7 P, Berg SS 120/2 SMS, Berg HR 120/1 M, Morgan HR 9J
(don&#39;t know tip opening - charts not clear), Rovner HR Wilkinson SB-9 C.P.

I play Big Band music and my comfortable choice is the RPC with LaVoz MS,M
reed also plastic cover for more projection with Bonade metal lig.

I gravitate towards Pepper Adams and Nick Brignola type sound when it comes
to a combo set up. Some bite in sound would be good and when pushing should
increase.

Which of my equipt is reasonably compatible with the horns. How about small
bore mpc eg Runyon metal series. What Runyon metal mpc are metal series.
For that matter What about a Jerry Hall JC2 Phat Boy Baritone mpc?

Thanks for your time and expertise in sharing your insight!!

Compatibility - Mouthpiece make and Bare Sax make? 
Hello,


My question: Are there concerns when I set-up my equip that certain brand

mpc brand is more compatible with certain brand saxophone due to the

internal bore size dimension relation of the mpc, neck and body of the sax?


I have come across expressions from repair tech that certain brand sax are

medium bore to medium large bore and was wondering whether this directly

involves choosing a mpc for a particular sax.


My equipt: Baritone Mk 6 with Low A Lacq with JSchmidt grey pads. Yanagisawa

(Prima) B6 Low A (to be overhaul soon). Mpcs RPC .125 Medium baffle, Lawton

brass lacq 5* B and 7 P, Berg SS 120/2 SMS, Berg HR 120/1 M, Morgan HR 9J

(don&#39;t know tip opening - charts not clear), Rovner HR Wilkinson SB-9 C.P.


I play Big Band music and my comfortable choice is the RPC with LaVoz MS,M

I find this is not a major concern on larger saxes.  I think it helps 
on soprano sax to be aware of chamber volume effects on intonation.  
But the player&#39;s embouchure and concept of sound are generally bigger 
factors in choosing a mouthpiece/reed/sax combo.  

Some vintage bari and tenor saxes are reported to have problems of 
mouthpieces "falling off the cork".  Martin and Conn 12M baris are 
frequently mentioned.  Owners need to find mouthpieces that work or 
they get the neck lengthened by 1/2"

I use a reworked Runyon Metal Quantum 11 and Fibracell reeds on a YBS-
52.  I have a large lower lip I roll in so I tend to play on the dark 
side.  I need some brightness built into my equipment to compensate.
