Sorry this isn&#39;t a mouthpiece question, but I figure with the number of saxophone guys here, I might find an answer.

 I e-mailed Jason Dumars a week ago inquiring about engraving work for my Mark VII alto that is being converted to a one-handed mechanism.  But I have not received a response as of yet.  Does anyone know of an alternative contact for him? all I have found was from his site:jason@...

The builder converting my sax is planning on sending my bell off to another engrver, but I would rather send my horn to Jason to have the works done to it, not just the bell touched up and added to in a traditional fashion.  I&#39;m not going to have a traditional horn, so I don&#39;t want traditional engraving :-)

Thanks
 Daniel

Sorry this isn&#39;t a mouthpiece question, but I figure with the number of saxophone guys here, I might find an answer.

 I e-mailed Jason Dumars a week ago inquiring about engraving work for my Mark VII alto that is being converted to a one-handed mechanism.  But I have not received a response as of yet.  Does anyone know of an alternative contact for him? all I have found was from his site:jason@...
