            <pre class='message__body'>This started as a vintage Nickel-plated (NP) Dukoff.  The plating was peeling off the body so I took the rest off with a razor blade and some sand paper.  The NP was holding better on the shank so I left it.  Plus I did not have enough plating bath to dip the entire mouthpiece anyway.

I added 4 "after" photos under the Brush Plating album (since I used a brush plating kit to do dip plating).
