            <pre class='message__body'>I have use fifteen gauges for many, many years. I found the 0.20 and 0.001 gauges have rescued many refacing puzzles.

I use an old “O’Brien System” glass gauge and clamp the mouthpiece to the glass with a modified Rovner baritone saxophone 

ligature to assure no movement while taking fifteen measurements. I also use a tapered metal gauge for the tip numbers. I don’t

Copy/Paste the numbers you want to copy in the red column and enter the numbers you are measuring in the green column. 

The calculations tell how much you are over or under and what needs to be changed.

Thanks for the help Keith! I&#39;m trying to look for facing measurements that uses more than 4 feelers, so like around 8? That would give me an idea of the exact ideal shape for clarinet mouthpiece facings ( I know that different manufacturers have slightly different ideal shapes but I&#39;m sure they all have somewhat a similar curve). It would really help to get measurements of many good clarinet mouthpieces so that I can see what is consistent among the facing curves of them. I live quite far away from music stores that sell good clarinet mouthpieces and my only good mouthpiece is the one I&#39;ve already posted. Could any clarinet playing members send me some measurements (using the 0.0015, 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, 0.030, 0.035 feeler gauges or something like that, no less than this if possible) of their favorite clarinet mouthpieces if they don&#39;t mind? It would really help me out!! If I get lucky and get donated a few measurements and end up discovering something from them I will certainly share it with the group.

 









Cheers!

This is a nice resource Ken.   Just an FYI: your feeler gauge decimal points are off by one place.  Like .42 should be .042".

[ &lt;https://us-mg6.mail.yahoo.com/neo/launch?.rand=ad32trmkfifhl#TopText> Attachment(s) from Ken Lagace Photos included below] 

I have use fifteen gauges for many, many years. I found the 0.20 and 0.001 gauges have rescued many refacing puzzles.

I use an old “O’Brien System” glass gauge and clamp the mouthpiece to the glass with a modified Rovner baritone saxophone 

ligature to assure no movement while taking fifteen measurements. I also use a tapered metal gauge for the tip numbers. I don’t

remember its origin.

 

Attached is my work Excel file. There are the numbers at the top for about 30 mouthpieces. The numbers of the best for me 

are in red and the Chedeville blank numbers are the mouthpiece I play today.

Below are some calculations that are very helpful. The numbers of the mouthpiece to copy are compared to the numbers you 

are measuring and differences are displayed.

 

Copy/Paste the numbers you want to copy in the red column and enter the numbers you are measuring in the green column. 

The calculations tell how much you are over or under and what needs to be changed.

 

This has been developed over many years of refacing. I offer it without any guarantees.

Comments are welcome.

Thanks for the help Keith! I&#39;m trying to look for facing measurements that uses more than 4 feelers, so like around 8? That would give me an idea of the exact ideal shape for clarinet mouthpiece facings ( I know that different manufacturers have slightly different ideal shapes but I&#39;m sure they all have somewhat a similar curve). It would really help to get measurements of many good clarinet mouthpieces so that I can see what is consistent among the facing curves of them. I live quite far away from music stores that sell good clarinet mouthpieces and my only good mouthpiece is the one I&#39;ve already posted. Could any clarinet playing members send me some measurements (using the 0.0015, 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, 0.030, 0.035 feeler gauges or something like that, no less than this if possible) of their favorite clarinet mouthpieces if they don&#39;t mind? It would really help me out!! If I get lucky and get donated a few measurements and end up discovering something from them I will certainly share it with the group.

I&#39;ve graphed up around half of your mouthpieces that were of interest to me using XY scatter graphs. 

I have not included the tip opening and the .0010 feeler (because I&#39;m lazy) but anyway I hope you find it interesting! We can see that although the mouthpieces were made from different brands and have different length facings it is incredibly obvious that they were all trying to create a similar shape (Sharp curve near the start of the facing and kind of flat afterwards, not a circular curve) Also, I can see why your Chedeville mouthpiece blank is your favorite! It has the least low/high spots and is a really nice smooth curve compared to other mouthpieces. 

 

I&#39;ve added two of my own mouthpieces, a good one and a not so good one. I have measured them very carefully quite a few times and I am really disappointed with the facing of my good mouthpiece! I paid a large amount of money for it. The reason I bought it was because I heard that they were incredibly well-made mouthpieces, the best of the best.

            <pre class='message__body'>When it comes to sax facing curves, bumps and flat spots are generally not a good feature.  But with clarinet facings, blended bumps may give resistance in spots where you like it.  So if you "fix" the irregularities in your favorite mouthpiece, you may no longer like it as much.

Also, you need to include the tip opening and tip rail width in your graphs.  If you do not, you will not know if the facing is flat or curved near the tip.  Your tip opening data needs to be accurate too to compare with the feeler X data.

            <pre class='message__body'>I added a tab to Ken&#39;s spreadsheet and made a combined overlay XY plot of all his curves.  (The layout would be much different if tip opening data was provided.)
If all or most of the curves have a bump or low spot in the same location, I would question the accuracy of the feeler gage used at that location.  For example, all the curves have a low glass gage reading at the .003" feeler.  The curves show a dip there indicating a bump in the curve OR the feeler used is thinner than .003".  Check your feeler sizes with a micrometer or at least calipers.
The .015" feeler looks like it may be larger than .015" based on most of the curves showing a low spot there.  Or the feelers on either side of this reading may be smaller than marked.  Irregularities can be measurement errors or facing curve shapes.
See Attch Spreadsheet.
Also, Harim has some typos in his use of the data.  You can see it in the plots where the same glass reading is used for 2 feelers.

 Thank you so much for all the advice and corrections Keith! I'm incredibly glad to hear that my mouthpiece is probably intended to look like that. As for the typo I had a little issue with my 0.008 and 0.010 feelers, I kept coming with a similar or same reading for both of my mouthpieces.. thought there might be something wrong with them. I'll try to check out their accuracy using my dial calipers.
 

 Thanks for all the help guys!! This saved me so much time.

            <pre class='message__body'>I got some of this backward.  It should read: 

If all or most of the curves have a bump or low spot in the same location, I would question the accuracy of the feeler gage used at that location.  For example, all the curves have a low glass gage reading at the .003" feeler.  The curves show a dip there indicating a bump in the curve OR the feeler used is THICKER than .003".  Check your feeler sizes with a micrometer or at least calipers.

The .015" feeler looks like it may be SMALLER than .015" based on most of the curves showing a low spot there.  Or the feelers on either side of this reading may be LARGER than marked.  Irregularities can be measurement errors or facing curve shapes.

I added a tab to Ken&#39;s spreadsheet and made a combined overlay XY plot of all his curves.  (The layout would be much different if tip opening data was provided.)

 

If all or most of the curves have a bump or low spot in the same location, I would question the accuracy of the feeler gage used at that location.  For example, all the curves have a low glass gage reading at the .003" feeler.  The curves show a dip there indicating a bump in the curve OR the feeler used is thinner than .003".  Check your feeler sizes with a micrometer or at least calipers.

 

The .015" feeler looks like it may be larger than .015" based on most of the curves showing a low spot there.  Or the feelers on either side of this reading may be smaller than marked.  Irregularities can be measurement errors or facing curve shapes.

Also, Harim has some typos in his use of the data.  You can see it in the plots where the same glass reading is used for 2 feelers.

I like your graphs – they look different than mine – and I never heard of ‘XY scatter graphs’. Could you explain how they are different and how to make them? There are some anomalies there that may improve my technique.

I&#39;ve graphed up around half of your mouthpieces that were of interest to me using XY scatter graphs. 

I have not included the tip opening and the .0010 feeler (because I&#39;m lazy) but anyway I hope you find it interesting! We can see that although the mouthpieces were made from different brands and have different length facings it is incredibly obvious that they were all trying to create a similar shape (Sharp curve near the start of the facing and kind of flat afterwards, not a circular curve) Also, I can see why your Chedeville mouthpiece blank is your favorite! It has the least low/high spots and is a really nice smooth curve compared to other mouthpieces. 

 

I&#39;ve added two of my own mouthpieces, a good one and a not so good one. I have measured them very carefully quite a few times and I am really disappointed with the facing of my good mouthpiece! I paid a large amount of money for it. The reason I bought it was because I heard that they were incredibly well-made mouthpieces, the best of the best.

 

Thanks again for lending your data Ken!   &lt;https://s.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo31.gif>  I have learnt more than enough from them and I hope that other clarinet mpce refacers just starting out find this post useful too.

 

And if I made any mistakes anywhere whether it be what I said or a mistake in the graphs please let me know! 

 

Cheers,&#39;
