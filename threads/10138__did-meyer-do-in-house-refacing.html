            <pre class='message__body'>Because of a disc drive crash, I was remeasuring a couple of my favorite pieces so that I would have the facing curve on hand.  I have a Woodwind Co. NY alto piece that&#39;s a B5^A (marked on the table) and a tenor Woodwind Sparkleaire that&#39;s a B5* (on the table).  

The tenor B5* is hard to read, so I put it under the magnifying glass.  Stamped over the faint B5* is "meYer" and underneath that is a stamped "6".  The stamp on the table isn&#39;t the later diamond logo and it has the meYer distinctive font, but the letters are really tiny, like 1mm.  Smaller than any other meYer stamp I can find in pictures on the web. It&#39;s so small that it looks like a special stamp for refacing work.

The opening is .082, which is much closer to a meYer 6 than a Woodwinds B5* (.064).  But a meYer 6 measuring .083 is closer to a "newer" (Babbit) facing than an older Meyer Bros. facing.  Has anybody seen this before or know if the brothers or Babbit did "meYer" refacing?

            <pre class='message__body'>  Hi Mark,  I haven&#39;t seen it but I am sure that both Meyer and Otto Link did refacing. It was all hand work so it would have been a cinch  for any of their employees to do refacing.   Besides sending goods  back to companies for repairs, refurbishing  etc was very common. A few still do it. An 83 year old dog walking friend just sent his 30 year old raincoat back to be re-treated.  Peter.
