I bought some ebonite rod, that I have turned on the lathe (for an art project).
It took the shape well, but I can not get it to polish.
The surface is hairy, yellowish, and pitted.
I lowered the feed rate, so the tool could cut and burnish, but that wasn&#39;t much better.

What is the standard method to turn then polish ebonite?

FWIW, I contacted the supplier (a pipe stem supplier), and he said that I can not mass finish hard rubber.  My desire would to be to finish the parts (like chess pieces) in some sort of automatic process.  I have a buffer, and ZAM was OK, but crappy, and Tripoli wasn&#39;t much better.

In fact, it looked too "new" for the rest of the key, so I sanded it with 2000 grit silicon carbide paper to take off the lustre and hand polished lightly with some plastic polish and a soft cloth.

 The tool was one of those small replaceable triangular shaped bits with slightly rounded tips, rather than a sharp point.  I don't remember the radius.

I have created two problems for myself.  There is a raised ridge on all of the parts, so I can not effectively sand -  I tried 400 lightly, then scotchbrite, but not to my satisfaction.  Also, I  need to glue two parts together (black against white), so Delrin is out -- very difficult to glue effectively.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well...
Since I can&#39;t use sandpaper, I did some research.  2000 grit sandpaper is 10.3 microns.
So I made my last pass before my finish size (of zero microns) at 10 microns, at 5 mm per minute feed rate.
My final pass was at 5mm as well.

It is highly probable that the tearing happens while at about 50 microns from the finished size, so I made successive passes (each time halving my depth of cut and feedrate).
So, from 50 microns and beyond, I kept it wet with a tiny square of green scotchbrite, soaked in rapid-tap and wd-40.


Spindle speed unknown, but as slow as my lathe will turn (probably about 600 rpm)

Roughing passes (to within 300 microns) 500 mm per minute (this yielded long strings, and it resembled threading)

Finishing pass @ 100 microns, 100 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 50 microns, 50 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 25 microns, 25 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 10 microns, 5 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 0 microns, 5 mm per min

Soaked in dishwashing liquid, scrubbed with a toothbrush.
I cleaned the corners and ends with a file, while the next part ran.
Into the tumbler for 2 hours.

Thanks Tony.
I have created two problems for myself.  There is a raised ridge on all of the parts, so I can not effectively sand -  I tried 400 lightly, then scotchbrite, but not to my satisfaction.  Also, I  need to glue two parts together (black against white), so Delrin is out -- very difficult to glue effectively.
