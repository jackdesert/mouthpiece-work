            <pre class='message__body'>With my mini-lathe I just made from Delrin a replacement knob for a beautifully restored c.1918 telegraph key.  For those interested, a J. H. Bunnell Triumph "Legless" 2A key.  With just the cutting tool I was able to achieve a shiny finish.  In fact, it looked too "new" for the rest of the key, so I sanded it with 2000 grit silicon carbide paper to take off the lustre and hand polished lightly with some plastic polish and a soft cloth.  Now it looks just right.
 

 The tool was one of those small replaceable triangular shaped bits with slightly rounded tips, rather than a sharp point.  I don't remember the radius.

I have created two problems for myself.  There is a raised ridge on all of the parts, so I can not effectively sand -  I tried 400 lightly, then scotchbrite, but not to my satisfaction.  Also, I  need to glue two parts together (black against white), so Delrin is out -- very difficult to glue effectively.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well...
Since I can&#39;t use sandpaper, I did some research.  2000 grit sandpaper is 10.3 microns.
So I made my last pass before my finish size (of zero microns) at 10 microns, at 5 mm per minute feed rate.
My final pass was at 5mm as well.

It is highly probable that the tearing happens while at about 50 microns from the finished size, so I made successive passes (each time halving my depth of cut and feedrate).
So, from 50 microns and beyond, I kept it wet with a tiny square of green scotchbrite, soaked in rapid-tap and wd-40.


Spindle speed unknown, but as slow as my lathe will turn (probably about 600 rpm)

Roughing passes (to within 300 microns) 500 mm per minute (this yielded long strings, and it resembled threading)

Finishing pass @ 100 microns, 100 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 50 microns, 50 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 25 microns, 25 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 10 microns, 5 mm per min
Finishing pass @ 0 microns, 5 mm per min

Soaked in dishwashing liquid, scrubbed with a toothbrush.
I cleaned the corners and ends with a file, while the next part ran.
Into the tumbler for 2 hours.
