            <pre class='message__body'>I am trying my best to work on the high end of the 3rd Register, and would like advice on mouthpiece / Reed set up

I know that there are several fingerings that can be used in the 3rd Register
I have the Thomas Ridenour Clarinet fingerings book, which gives many combinations of alternate fingerings.

I was wondering if there were any characteristics of the mouthpiece that might influence the results. Does the Length of lay or tip opening affect the altissimo success rate?  or is it more the Reed?  or Player?

I am playing on a Yamaha 450 clarinet with Selmer c85 120 mouthpiece and 2 1/2 vandoren reeds

I am able to play high G and A but I am not having much success going higher (I tend to practise these notes when the neighbours are out)

Kind Regards, Peter

            <pre class='message__body'> Altissimo on clarinet and sax are the same and   almost any decent mouthpiece /reed combination works well.   Probably the reed is more critical. If you get Ridenour&#39;s reed adjusting kit ( highly recommended)  you will find that he uses low D, third A and  altissimo A  to test a reed for hardness and response. You sand  material off the shoulders of the reed until all three notes speak easily.    To play altissimo you need to shape the inside of your mouth as if you are trying to sing the note you want. Someone has even experimented with tiny mics in sax players&#39; mouths and found that those who could play altissimo were actually "resonating&#39; the required note by their mouth shape and this was  was being picked up by the mics.   Under no circumstance should you try to play altissimo notes by firming up the embouchure or , even worse biting.   I&#39;m sure you can get advice about how to modify a mouthpiece to facilitate playing high notes but
 this often comes at the expense of poor quality low register notes.

            <pre class='message__body'>There are several good books on saxophone altissimo register which teach 
the technique of "revoicing" within the oral cavity.  The techniques 
work on clarinet as well.  When speaking with "lead" trumpet specialists 
and french horn players with extended ranges, I find that they all use 
similar methods.  I personally find Yamaha clarinets to be a bit stuffy 
when compared to other instruments out there, but I have no trouble 
going beyond the staff on them with my Portnoy B2.

You might try contacting Dr. Robert DiLutis @ LSU in Baton Rouge.  He 
makes a fabulous mouthpiece and may be able to help you out.  And 
they&#39;re cheaper than the name brands!

Peter,
Up there where you are trying to play is in the smallest tip end of the reed and the mouthpiece. The mouthpiece may need a tad more opening at the tip or the reed needs to gave a thinner tip - we are talking about the first 1.5mm or less. This is an area fraught with danger. It would better to find a mouthpiece and reed that can do this for you.

            <pre class='message__body'>Many Thanks for all of your replies to this post!!!

I Agree that I should try a little less open m/p and stiffer reeds - 
trying different brands also.
On my Saxophone i do practise the overtone exercises - but not as often 
as I should (shame on me)

I must be honest and say that I haven&#39;t done these exercises on the 
Clarinet - Is this an exercise that should be practised  on Clarinet as 
on the Sax -
Without using the register key?

Does the shape of the baffle affect altissimo?


Thanks for you info
Peter

Peter, I&#39;m not much on clarinet (though I do much better on bass clarinet), but I can play the 3rd register easily with a tip I learned from an orchestral clarinetist.

For the third register of the clarinet the index finger of the left hand is lifted off the tonehole.  It is, in effect, acting as a second register vent.  But look at the size of that hole!  And compare it to the regular clarinet register vent, or the octave vents of the saxophone.  Those are very small holes.

The tip shown to me was to not lift the finger all the way off the hole, but to just roll it down a little, to "half hole" the tonehole, or better, to just barely crack it open at the top edge.  The the 3rd register came out easily.

Paul, you may not be aware of it, but the bass clarinet top left hand key is set up for half hole fingering by moving the left hand index finger onto the key extension. The recorder which is also a cylindrical shaped instrument uses left hand index finger half hole fingerings on high notes. The half hole index fingering on the clarinet will help the response of high C#/Db through F. 

It is my experience that attempting to play the high register of the clarinet on reeds that are too soft, such as a 2 1/2 will yield poor results with regard to response and worse results with regard to accurate intonation.

            <pre class='message__body'>The exercises should be practiced on every horn that you play.  My tenor 
and alto both voice a little differently, and if I don&#39;t keep them 
"locked in" with practice, I&#39;ll lunch it on a show.  Very embarrassing.  
You should also play around with the fingerings to find the ones that 
vent best on your instrument.  Once again, my tenor "vents" differently 
from my alto, so I have a couple of different fingerings for them.

Phil Woods made the point at a master class that I attended that if you 
can hear the pitch, you can play it.  I find that to be mostly true.  
But you have to ear train by having success in the practice room.

Go to your local music store and buy a few single reeds of various type, 
then ask if you can try mouthpieces.  Reputable stores will let you.

Peter, I'm not much on clarinet (though I do much better on bass 
clarinet), but I can play the 3rd register easily with a tip I learned 
from an orchestral clarinetist.

For the third register of the clarinet the index finger of the left 
hand is lifted off the tonehole.  It is, in effect, acting as a second 
register vent.  But look at the size of that hole!  And compare it to 
the regular clarinet register vent, or the octave vents of the 
saxophone.  Those are very small holes.

The tip shown to me was to not lift the finger all the way off the 
hole, but to just roll it down a little, to "half hole" the tonehole, 
or better, to just barely crack it open at the top edge.  The the 3rd 
register came out easily.

      Of course, what and how you play makes a difference.  Classical players generally use close facings and stiff reeds.  Jazz players prefer more open/soft setups which make note bending and vibrato easier.

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, in the higher registers the partials on clarinet are complete. The higher one goes, the more various bore and other perturbations trump the impedances of the straight cylinder. This is one of the reasons that the higher registers sound so different from the lowest register on the
 clarinet.

Peter, I&#39;m not much on clarinet (though I do much better on bass clarinet), but I can play the 3rd register easily with a tip I learned from an orchestral clarinetist.

For the third register of the clarinet the index finger of the left hand is lifted off the tonehole. It is, in effect, acting as a second register vent. But look at the size of that hole! And compare it to the regular clarinet register vent, or the octave vents of the saxophone. Those are very
 small holes.

The tip shown to me was to not lift the finger all the way off the hole, but to just roll it down a little, to "half hole" the tonehole, or better, to just barely crack it open at the top edge. The the 3rd register came out easily.

I have always preferred softer reeds with medium to open tip,
It is time to move on and go for slightly harder reed, and maybe try 
some new mouthpieces
Thanks for all your info

            <pre class='message__body'>With all of this altissimo information, do not minimize the embouchure&#39;s contribution. Any more than the red part of the lips on the reed is absorbing the high harmonics. If a player plays this way, he (she) has chosen mouthpieces and reeds that work that way. The altissimo then suffers and has to be dealt with in inefficient ways. It is always best to choose a mouthpiece with the best embouchure and best reed and then choose a reed with the best embouchure and best mouthpiece.

 Is this why clarinet players who can play high harmonics with ease have been thin lipped European types. Artie Shaw/Allen Vache spring to mind and the Afro races seem to ignore the the clarinet today, in favour of the Saxophone?
 As a swollen lipped doubler,I can still hit those highs though.(^_^)

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Eddie,

As for the last sentence, if you are a clarinet player, you have favorite reeds. I have seen players buy new reeds to test a new mouthpiece. Bad plan. After you use a favorite reed and have chosen a next mouthpiece, and playing it a while, you may find thet it plays even better with reeds other than your prior favorites.
As for the lip effect on harmonics, the lip is not near any of the reed vibrations or it would not vibrate at all, but the whole reed affects the harmonics. Notice the popularity of the Rovner ligature which gives a different sound than the metal ligatures. Notice that if you wet the whole reed it plays differently than if you just wet the tip.
Anyone can figure out a way to play the high notes and I applaud your ability to play them. With using the thinnest part of lower lip on the reed, I can play a high &#39;D&#39; one and a half octaves above the staff &#39;without changing the embouchure&#39; to get there. I change voicing yes, but not the embouchure.

            <pre class='message__body'>Clarinet depends on the player&#39;s lips to damp the natural resonances of the reed so that you don&#39;t get a squeak. This is different than sax because of the different bore shape. After that, it is completely up to the player&#39;s sensitivity and control. There is no correct lip shape or size. As the
 girls say, it&#39;s not how big they are, it&#39;s how you use them ;-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Ken,  You are right . Altissimo  is not  through  embouchure changes  but in voicing changes.. I have witnessed the late 1st chair player in the Montreal Symphony, Emilio Iacurto, demonstrate this  by playing a chromatic run from low E to the C almost four octaves above  with no change in his embouchure at all.   It is only in jazz that we change embouchure and it is done for expressive reasons such as falls, subtone etc, not to actually get a desired note.  A good mouthpiece is one that allows you to do this, along with a responsive reed of course.   Peter.

            <pre class='message__body'>  I think the only difference between clarinet and sax embouchure is the angle of the instrument and the firmer embouchure required due to  a smaller reed. This is similar to the difference between a bari and a soprano sax embouchure.  The other difference is in the pressure required to send the air down the tube. The clarinet being a cylinder , requires more  than the sax. With a clarinet you need to push the air down whereas a with a sax you  " chase " the air down the tube.  I think that once the right embouchure is learned, most of the squeaks one gets on clarinet are due to faulty fingering rather than anything the player does at the mouthpiece end.    Whether the clarinet is a "blown" or a "fingered" instrument is an argument that has been going on for a long time in the clarinet world. Players obviously need to focus on the deficiencies of either of these  parts of their technique.   Peter

      Clarinet depends on the player&#39;s lips to damp the natural resonances of the reed so that you don&#39;t get a squeak. This is different than sax because of the different bore shape. After that, it is completely up to the player&#39;s sensitivity and control. There is no correct lip shape or size. As the
 girls say, it&#39;s not how big they are, it&#39;s how you use them ;-)

 has to be dealt with in inefficient ways. It is always best to choose a mouthpiece with the best embouchure and best reed and then choose a reed with the best embouchure and best mouthpiece.

 racial types with naturally thick lips would have a hard time, according to your hypothesis.

  Is this why clarinet players who can play high harmonics with ease have been thin lipped European types. Artie Shaw/Allen Vache spring to mind and the Afro races seem to ignore the the clarinet today, in favour of the Saxophone?

  As a swollen lipped doubler,I can still hit those highs though.(^_^)

 harmonics but much harder to get the fundamental! ツ Peter

Some classical players might consider your mouthpiece a little open and more suited to jazz playing, but then again, a little close for that style by others.
One of the easist MPC&#39;s I have found to get altissimo on, was a Vandoren 5RV. This has a close tip (1.05) and a long lay.
My own preference is for a short lay and open tip, as I find this suits various Jazz styles and does not seem to compromise altissimo.
I think your reed choice of Vandoren with its thin tip is probably a good choice but I would have tried a #3 with your tip opening.

regards, Eddie.
