            <pre class='message__body'>I use a coating of JB Weld inside the mouthpiece.  Then I coil up a strip of clear plastic and let it spring open inside the shank.  After it sets, peel out the plastic and sand it smooth.  You usually need to make the bore diameter .010" smaller when they are too loose.

            <pre class='message__body'>The strip of coiled plastic is just there as a temporary former to mould the
JB Weld to the required shape. Once the JJB Weld has set it can be removed
and the JB Weld sanded to final fit.

Thanks for the suggestions. I&#39;m learning the craft by using Runyon blanks
and they are larger than most alto bores. Regarding Ken&#39;s suggestion what do
you mean by "peel out the plastic"? You don&#39;t mean take out what you just
