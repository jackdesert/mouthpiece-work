After working on the facing, particularly with Stainless Steel 
pieces, I have a very sharp edge to the rails (and table if I had to 
cut it to get it flat).  Is there a consensus about whether to leave 
them square and sharp or to round off or bevel the edge?

            <pre class='message__body'>I usually take some 1200 or 2000 grit paper to the edges to remove burrs. You should not round them any more than necessary to get rid of the roughness and very sharp edge IMO. A couple of swipes with the paper held on a soft surface such as the pad of a finger is more than enough.

I&#39;ve seen older pieces that had a definite bevel to them.  I&#39;ve seen 
pieces that are very rounded. I&#39;ve seen pieces that are fairly square 
and sharp with just the very edge burnished off. 

I was wondering if there might not be some sonic difference from the 
shape of the edge at the side rails (there certainly is a difference 
from the shape at the edge of the tip rail).
