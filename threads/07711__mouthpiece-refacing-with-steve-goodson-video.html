It begins with the usual warning about copyright infringement delivered by "Low Bb, Vice President in charge of problem customers, collections..." (hahaha...) with his unforgetable basso profundo voice.

Though Steve never got around to demonstrating one of the tools on the table he did cover all the basics. He gives an excellent overview of the tools, materials, techniques and resources used in mouthpiece work, both the how and the why.

Something I thought especially well done on the video was closeups of the mouthpieces as he worked on them, getting good video of the table as it was flattened, siderail and tip work. These details were easy to see, and I know they are difficult to photograph.

Steve, great video... a job well done!
