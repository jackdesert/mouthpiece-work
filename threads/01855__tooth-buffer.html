            <pre class='message__body'>Have a Sugal, gold plated. it came with a glued on buffer. It fell 
off after a year. Is there a Link-type plastic piece that I could 
inlay? Can I file a 1/8 " grove in top of piece to inlay plastic? 
It&#39;s a great piece except for this part. I&#39;ve come down to gluing 
cross-sections of reed to act as a buffer. This works except for the 
fear o0f splintes.       Jackoooooooooooooooo

            <pre class='message__body'>Jackoooooooooooooooo, I&#39;ll send you pictures of how I fixed Boots 
Randolph&#39;s old Brilhart.  Yes, the one he used to record Yakety Sax and 
Rock Around the Christmas Tree (with Brenda Lee).

I used thick CA glue for this, other types of bite plates, I use other 
glues.  These pictures are also posted on this site.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey, Paul, I&#39;d appreciate seeing those pictures as I&#39;m getting ready to jump into the first of three older metal pieces I picked up on eBay, and every little bit of help...helps!!! Especially on a Brilhart. The others I have are an old, old Santy Runyon metal and a vintage Berg that looks like the previous owner used as a pacifier...the plastic plate is worn through to the metal. 
 
When you have time I&#39;d like to see them...and thanks in advance.

            <pre class='message__body'>This should explain it all.  I used a thick CA glue (superglue) and 
sanded the gluing surface of the plastic to get better bite with the glue.
