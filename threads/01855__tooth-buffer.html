It&#39;s a great piece except for this part. I&#39;ve come down to gluing 
cross-sections of reed to act as a buffer. This works except for the 
fear o0f splintes.       Jackoooooooooooooooo

I used thick CA glue for this, other types of bite plates, I use other 
glues.  These pictures are also posted on this site.

Especially on a Brilhart. The others I have are an old, old Santy Runyon metal and a vintage Berg that looks like the previous owner used as a pacifier...the plastic plate is worn through to the metal. 
 
When you have time I&#39;d like to see them...and thanks in advance.
