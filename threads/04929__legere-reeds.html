            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve got hundreds of Legere reeds in stock (from a distributors agreement
long ago) and on eBay right now. We don&#39;t have every size or strength
anymore, but we do have some things. They&#39;re in my warehouse in Texas, so I
can&#39;t tell you exactly what&#39;s on hand. Most of the inventory is for
clarinet.
 
The leak test described sounds interesting, and I&#39;m anxious to try it.
