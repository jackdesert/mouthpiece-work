            <pre class='message__body'>Hello... I&#39;m new to the group and would like some help getting started on my new quest.  Can 
someone please recommend a place who has measuring tools, refacing tools etc?  I see 
messages refering to places that might no longer exist or carry the needed tools.
Thanks much.  Rob

            <pre class='message__body'>On the home page of the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site there is a reference to
what file to look at for tool sources.  The Files and Links sections have
sources too.  If some of the sources are not current, let me know and I
will clean them out.

response if you inquire about one of his dial gauges.  There are 
alternatives.  Also see the Photos section for do-it-yourself gauges.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry to hear that.  I very recently corresponded with Steve, having
just bought one of his digital in/mm dial gauges which is great--very
well-engineered tool.  Hold out for one if you can.
