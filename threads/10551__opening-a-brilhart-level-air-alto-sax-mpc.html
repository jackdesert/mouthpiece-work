            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:
I have an old Brilhart level air alto sax mpc ( metal) but I find it too
close , it is a number 4, and it is about 0.067". I have two options, sell
it or try to open it to a 0.080"minimum, I live in Honduras and it is
almost impossible to go to a mpc refacer, so it is probable that I have to
do it by myself, but I am far to be an expert. I just have tried to open
some plastic cheap mpcs with some success.

Any suggestions?
