            <pre class='message__body'>What else can be used in this manner that is not toxic and doesnt 
require a mpc patch when its done?  I want to be able to put in a 
biteplate that can be installed before plating.  I dont know what real 
bite plates like on links is made of and if its held in by glues will 
it stay put through the plating process.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use an acrylic adheasive called 3M DP-810 Black.  It has been 
discontinued in Black but I just found some at:

The picture shown is not it, but it comes in a similar cartridge.  I 
made a dual wood plunger out of dowels to push the stuff out.  It 
makes nice repairs in Links, Bergs, vintage LA&#39;s, etc.  

For a full replacement, there are sometimes some air bubbles.  It is 
best to cast it fast since it turns to a jell-like consistancy in 
minutes.  It hardens (1-3 hours) under the heat of a light bulb.  
Otherwise it can take a couple of days.

It does not hold up to Anderson&#39;s plating process.  Some other 
plating processes may not be so harsh.

J. Gerber appears to be shaping and gluing in tooth decks.  Sugal 
too.  You can get fancy colors this way with sparkles.  Dunno where 
though.

There are some links to Dental acrylics in the Tools and Materials 
section.  The hand finished Guardalas used some kind of pink Dental 
material.

Clear adheasives can be colored with pigments when mixed.

I just got some in, hoping for new old stock.  But they sent me the 
regular 810 in clear-blue.  I&#39;ll see how it works mixed with black 
pigment.

I also have some DP-820 that is light tan.  Smells like the Dickens 
when mixing.  The DP-810 is "low odor".
