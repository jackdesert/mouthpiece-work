            <pre class='message__body'>Hello gentlemen,

I understand that you are in the midst of a controversy to which the rest of us are largely bystanders. But since it is a public group, I will hazard a question which you may consider if you like. But it does indeed have to do with saxophone acoustics.

I have long been puzzled by the relative instability of low D on most, if not all, makes of saxophone. Most recently I have been working on a long tone exercise in the following way: I start the note with air alone and try to "breathe into" the note in such a way that there is a seamless transition from silence to ppp, and I continue to crescendo to full volume.

Low D is for me the most difficult note on which to find the right placement for the airstream to achieve the desired result. But on both alto and tenor, and across many different makes, low D has been usually the most problematic note on the horn.

Perhaps of relevance is the notorious stuffiness on most horns of D2. I recently saw a harmonic spectrum of D2 as played on my vintage Couesnon alto, an instrument of really impeccable intonation, and it was interesting to note that the note had a few strong overtones, but not the range of overtones I saw on other notes. Didn&#39;t Benade say something about notes with few overtones being unstable? But I wouldn&#39;t characterize the D2 as being as unstable as D1.

But there seem to be issues buzzing about the D tonehole on the RH stack. 

Anyone care to address this issue?

Thanks, JT

Hi Jeff,  welcome on board.  Don&#39;t mind the natives here.  We get carried away sometimes.  You have brought up a very interesting problem, that I have been very interested in for a long time.

Part of the problem with the D is that it is naturally "under vented".  By that I mean that the open low C tonehole vents the D, but the next tonehole low C# is naturally closed. Opening the low C key as much as possible can help the low D, but often exacerbates the pitch problem of the D an octave higher which is often sharp.

Interestingly on several of the lower notes of the saxophone and other conical bore woodwinds the second harmonic is stronger than the first.  This is why when one plays a decrescendo on a low tone, there is a point where the upper octave wants to take over.  That is just the nature of the beast.  Some things that I have found that help are to make sure the saxophone is perfectly airtight from top to bottom, including the neck tenon, and to use reeds that are not too stiff.  Working on playing overtones can help as well in developing the sensitivity the oral cavity required to play the low register softly.

There are also some makes of saxophones that simply play more effortlessly in their low registers than others as well.  I&#39;m sure others here have a lot more to add to what I have said. 

Again, thanks for jumping into the shark tank.  You can relax though since Lance and I only snap at one another.

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice to move on to other topics. For D1, I think the main problem is that the venting is not so good, since the C# key is reverse sprung and normally remains closed. To be honest, I do not generally have trouble with D1 on either my sop, alto or two tenors, but I know that many people have the
 same issue that you do.

D2 suffers from a second problem, which is that the body octave vent is really in the wrong position for this note. If you open the palm D instead of the octave key (which is in the right octave vent position for D2) you will notice that while the note gets rather sharp (since the hole is much too
 large to serve as a decent octave vent), the note becomes quite clear, losing its stuffiness.

The problem with the lower notes of a conical instrument is that you have a very small little generator at the top that has to push a huge amount of air when the air column is long. As John says, this is just the nature of the beast, but of course this applies to the bell notes as well.

As John says, the D is not optimally vented, though the E and A above it are vented the same way, and they don&#39;t have the same problem, so that might not be the entire story.

I agree completely with John on playing overtone exercises to develop the "feel" for the correct oral cavity shape for the low register.  I would redefine your concept of, "... the right 
placement for the airstream to achieve the desired result."  The reed is vibrating between two resonating chambers, the horn body, and your body, and it is coupled to both.  With the proper amount of air pressure, (as opposed to air speed, air stream direction, or air focus) all you need is the right oral cavity resonating chamber, shape or volume, to get low notes to sound their best, and when you get into it, each note needs it&#39;s own shape or volume.

Besides making sure your horn is air-tight, you can check the body/bow coupling.  Many horns, even revered models, are put together sloppily in this area.  There will often be a large, 1mm or so gap between the segments, and the bow segment will protrude into the bore profile, with a sharp exposed edge, the entire circumference of the bore.  This will cause a good deal of turbulence and energy loss, in areas of high acoustical flow, which that area is, for D1 and D2.

Trading in your mis-matched cylindrical tenon for a matched conical tenon will improve things as well.

If I did all that, and was still unsatisfied, then I would start adjusting the alignment and amplitudes of the D1 harmonic resonances.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear all,

Thanks for your great responses. I brought up the issue, not because it is a problem in normal playing, but the sort of extreme long tone exercise I was doing highlighted an issue that I have noted on many horns, so I figured that it was an issue with the saxophone in general. In normal playing, it is not a problem at all. But yes, John, I agree that overtone exercises are great for "teaching the player" the particular oral cavity configurations required to produce each individual harmonic. I am an enthusiastic proponent of them.

In this particular long tone exercise, I am finding that oral cavity is important, but also airstream direction and focus in getting D1 to move seamlessly from silence to the faintest pianissimo.

Lance, thanks for the suggestions regarding fine-tuning of the body-bow coupling and the conical tenon. If I find that this continues to be an issue, even in practice exercises like this, I may send it to you. Thanks for the suggestion. And in general, I do appreciate your sensitivity to the finer aspects of fit and finish that relevant to the artist. Those concerns are indeed different than those of the student. Too few people understand this. Another guy who does is Randy Jones of Tenor Madness.

Lance, you said: "I would start adjusting the alignment and amplitudes of the D1 harmonic resonances." How would you do this on the horn? Wouldn&#39;t one do this with mpc choice?

Interesting that I am only a mediocre swimmer, but the sharks haven&#39;t eaten me yet. The only thing I can conclude is that they have feasted so much on each other that they are finally sated. I don&#39;t know if this bodes well for future discussion on the list. JT

I recently saw a harmonic spectrum of D2 as played on my vintage Couesnon alto, an instrument of really impeccable intonation, and it was interesting to note that the note had a few strong overtones, but not the range of overtones I saw on other notes. Didn&#39;t Benade say something about notes with few overtones being unstable? But I wouldn&#39;t characterize the D2 as being as unstable as D1.

            <pre class='message__body'>Jeff,

The conical tenon requires a larger receiver.  I make a matched tenon/receiver pair.  I could make them in the socket configuration, though it is a bit more complicated.

Back to resonance adjustment:  First I would analyze the mouthpiece/horn volume/frs relationship, to make sure they were optimal.  Then resonance adjustment could be attempted, if necessary.  

Example:  One of the standard cures for the unstable low B, is to shift the 3rd mode resonance (F#3 or second harmonic) slightly in pitch, so that it is off-peak, in amplitude/freq. relationship to the integral ideal.  It will loose a little amplitude.  One enlarges the bore in the area of the F#3 displacement anti-node, around the tenon area, by shortening the tenon, enlarging the bass of the neck, or lengthening the F# tone hole chimney.  

Successful adjustment requires knowledge of node locations and understanding of mode relationships of the whole horn.

You might also try increasing (double, triple)  the thickness of the resonator on the Eb, chromatic F#, side Bb, and side C keys, to see if that helps.

Does your conical tenon also adapt to double socket designs? The Couesnon is a double socket like the old Kings. JT

If I find that this continues to be an issue, even in practice exercises like this, I may send it to you. Thanks for the suggestion. And in general, I do appreciate your sensitivity to the finer aspects of fit and finish that relevant to the artist. Those concerns are indeed different than those of the student. Too few people understand this. Another guy who does is Randy Jones of Tenor Madness.

Opening the low C key as much as possible can help the low D, but often exacerbates the pitch problem of the D an octave higher which is often sharp.

This is why when one plays a decrescendo on a low tone, there is a point where the upper octave wants to take over.  That is just the nature of the beast.  Some things that I have found that help are to make sure the saxophone is perfectly airtight from top to bottom, including the neck tenon, and to use reeds that are not too stiff.  Working on playing overtones can help as well in developing the sensitivity the oral cavity required to play the low register softly.

Most recently I have been working on a long tone exercise in the following way: I start the note with air alone and try to "breathe into" the note in such a way that there is a seamless transition from silence to ppp, and I continue to crescendo to full volume.

I recently saw a harmonic spectrum of D2 as played on my vintage Couesnon alto, an instrument of really impeccable intonation, and it was interesting to note that the note had a few strong overtones, but not the range of overtones I saw on other notes. Didn&#39;t Benade say something about notes with few overtones being unstable? But I wouldn&#39;t characterize the D2 as being as unstable as D1.
