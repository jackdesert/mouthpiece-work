We didn&#39;t get into this aspect of the cycle in our last discussion.  

The significance: Just look at the comparison and see if anything comes to mind (leaving out end corrections):

Cylindrical Cycle  = 4 x air column length

Conical Cycle (Benade) = 2 x air column length (apex - bell/tone hole - apex)

Conical Cycle (Rockaboy) = 2 x air column length (apex - bell/tone hole - apex) + 2 x truncation length (apex - truncation - apex)

I would think that just the existance of the considerable discrepancy between Benade&#39;s (traditional view) and Rockaboy&#39;s view would be significant enough to comment on.

      Sure.  It has the same practical significance and application as becoming a member of the MouthpieceWork2 Acoustics Group.

Lance, at the risk of repeating myself, can you explain the practical significance and application of understanding the reed cycle in conical woodwinds?  Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>Here&#39;s something for anyone calculating mouthpiece volume based upon the taper of their neck as opposed to that of the sax body, to think about.  The extension of the body taper results in a considerably longer truncation to apex length than that of the neck.  Since volume is a low frequency requirement, which calculated apex to tone hole (with tone hole diameter compensation, end compensation, and open tone hole lattice compensation) to apex wavelength will match the actual played pitch better for say, low E, that of the body extension or that of the neck extension?

My point Lance is that our discussions seem to descend to arguing minutiae for argument&#39;s sake which accomplishes very little.

An example of what I meant by my question would be:

Q:  Why examine the process involved in computing the volume of the missing cone?

A:  To better understand how to match the mouthpiece effective volume to that of the missing cone in  to make the instrument play better in tune.

Q:  Why examine the difference between the reed cycle in cylindrical and conical woodwinds.

A:  To better understand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  in order to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It has nothing to do with the commercial application of the information in order to make money.  It has everything to do with the POINT of the discussion.  If the discussion has no POINT, then my question is:

WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING THE DISCUSSION IN THE FIRST PLACE?

Argument for argument&#39;s sake is not a discussion of acoustics, it is a pissing contest.  There are better things to do with our time IMO.

First, I agree with John. I can see no reason to discuss such things at our level of understanding. If we all understood the math, and were up to date with all the literature, that might be different. But as John says, we end up arguing minutiae, most of which we don&#39;t even begin to understand
 enough to open our mouths about. At least some of the stuff we discussed in the past seemed to have some practical applications at our level of the saxiverse, but the reed cycle seems completely esoteric in this sense.

That being said, I&#39;m a bit confused about your assertion that Rocaboy says that the sounding length of a conical instrument should be cone length plus 2x truncation. This is what I read in Rocaboy:

"The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;). The extra time (A&#39;B) or (t)--roughly equal to the time of closure of the reed--is, as we shall see at a later stage, approximately related to the fictitious transit time of a pulse to
 the apex and back. This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to the apex."

The only really new thing I got from this on a cursory reading was that the cone angle influenced the reed cycle. I see nothing anywhere to suggest that the sounding length should be considered different from a cone complete to the apex.

 My point Lance is that our discussions seem to descend to arguing minutiae for argument&#39;s sake which accomplishes very little.
 
 An example of what I meant by my question would be:
 
 Q:  Why examine the process involved in computing the volume of the missing cone?
 
 A:  To better understand how to match the mouthpiece effective volume to that of the missing cone in  to make the instrument play better in tune.
 
 Q:  Why examine the difference between the reed cycle in cylindrical and conical woodwinds.
 
 A:  To better understand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  in order to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
 
 It has nothing to do with the commercial application of the information in order to make money.  It has everything to do with the POINT of the discussion.  If the discussion has no POINT, then my question is:
 
 WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING THE DISCUSSION IN THE FIRST PLACE?
 
 Argument for argument&#39;s sake is not a discussion of acoustics, it is a pissing contest.  There are better things to do with our time IMO.

"The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;)."

Rocaboy&#39;s use of "tube" here includes the bocal and reed - reed tip to reed tip transit, as he further elaborates.  He clearly is not describing transit of the truncated tube alone, since the cycle begins at the reed tip   As the volume of the bocal + reed = the missing cone, (AA) = the equivalent of an apex to bell/tone hole to apex transit.  He then adds a double transit, apex to truncation to apex,  to that period.

apex and back is added to that transit cycle from the reed tip to form
the periodic time of oscillation which can be  represented by AB.

Rockaboy goes on to say:  "This is in accordance with the simple
theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal
to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to
its apex".

Benade&#39;s  Frs = v/2xo  for the frequency of the missing cone given its
length xo is completely congruous with Rocaboy&#39;s reed cycle in conical
woodwinds findings.

Can you explain the practical significance and application of

"The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;)."

Rocaboy&#39;s use of "tube" here includes the bocal and reed - reed tip to reed tip transit, as he further elaborates.  He clearly is not describing transit of the truncated tube alone, since the cycle begins at the reed tip   As the volume of the bocal + reed = the missing cone, (AA) = the equivalent
 of an apex to bell/tone hole to apex transit.  He then adds a double transit, apex to truncation to apex,  to that period.

For the reed cycle, agreed, but not in terms of the general tuning length.  He says specifically:

This is in accordance with the simple  theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal  to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to  the apex."

The paper concerns what happens at the reed end while the wave is doing its thing, which has the timing of a similar wave in a complete cone or an open/closed cylinder of the same length.  That obviously does have some effect on tuning, as we know from our studies of the volume of the
 substitution. I wasn&#39;t aware that cone angle has an effect once the volume is correct, though. Nowhere do I see Rocaboy even hinting that the tuning length is tube plus 2x truncation length.

 First, I agree with John. I can see no reason to discuss such things at our level of understanding. If we all understood the math, and were up to date with all the literature, that might be different. But as John says, we end up arguing minutiae, most of which we don&#39;t even begin to understand 
 enough to open our mouths about. At least some of the stuff we discussed in the past seemed to have some practical applications at our level of the saxiverse, but the reed cycle seems completely esoteric in this sense.
 
 That being said, I&#39;m a bit confused about your assertion that Rocaboy says that the sounding length of a conical instrument should be cone length plus 2x truncation. This is what I read in Rocaboy:
 
 "The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;). The extra time (A&#39;B) or (t)--roughly equal to the time of closure of the reed--is, as we shall see at a later stage, approximately related to the fictitious transit time of a pulse
 to  the apex and back. This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to the apex."
 
 The only really new thing I got from this on a cursory reading was that the cone angle influenced the reed cycle. I see nothing anywhere to suggest that the sounding length should be considered different from a cone complete to the apex.

  My point Lance is that our discussions seem to descend to arguing minutiae for argument&#39;s sake which accomplishes very little.
  
  An example of what I meant by my question would be:
  
  Q:  Why examine the process involved in computing the volume of the missing cone?
  
  A:  To better understand how to match the mouthpiece effective volume to that of the missing cone in  to make the instrument play better in tune.

  Argument for argument&#39;s sake is not a discussion of acoustics, it is a pissing contest.  There are better things to do with our time IMO.

To this definition/time period, Rocaboy adds the time of a double transit from the theoretical apex to the truncation constriction, and back, for reed closure.  So Rocaboy&#39;s cylcle consists of the following transits:

What I read is that AA&#39; is the transit cycle from  the reed tip to the open tonehole/bell and back.  Then A&#39;B, the time of the closure of the reed which is related to the ficticious transit time to the imaginary apex and back is added to that transit cycle from the reed tip to form the periodic time of oscillation which can be  represented by AB.

Rockaboy goes on to say:  "This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to its apex".

Benade&#39;s  Frs = v/2xo  for the frequency of the missing cone given its length xo is completely congruous with Rocaboy&#39;s reed cycle in conical woodwinds findings.

Rocaboy says the reed does not close until the wave returns to the reed tip (to the theoretical apex, after 2 complete lengths of the theoretical cone/actual air column).  Only then does the free oscellation begin, which lasts an additional, apex to truncation to apex period, or the length of time the reed is closed.

His mentioning, This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period
 of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of
 length equal to the cone continued to its apex" simply shows how he calculated the length of the free oscillation period.  Nothing more.

      If "AA" is the transit cycle from the reed tip, to the open tone hole/bell, and back to the reed tip, two lengths of the entire air column, then that time period is equal to traveling at the speed of sound, going from the theoretical apex to the open tone hole/bell and back to the apex .  This is Benade&#39;s, and everyone elses, description of a complete cycle for any conical woodwind.- 2 x length.  Correct?

            <pre class='message__body'>You&#39;ve got it all wrong. The period of the sounding wave is AB: this is the time between compression waves. AA&#39; (on the pressure chart, corresponding to theta on the displacement chart) is the period between when the compression wave is sent out from the reed and returns to the reed, which is
 shorter by the period tau (or A&#39;B) than the sounding period. The whole point of the exercise is how tau (or A&#39;B on the pressure chart) gets added to theta: how a physical cone + reed/mpc that is shorter than a full cone still manages to have the sounding frequency of a full cone. The returning
 wave closes the reed at AA&#39;, triggering a new rarefaction which keeps the reed closed for the period A&#39;B before the reed reopens.

There is no AA; AA&#39; is the actual time period of reed tip--end--reed tip (NOT to the theoretical end of the cone). 

Now read this again:

"The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time  of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;). The extra time (A&#39;B) or  (t)--roughly equal to the time of closure of the reed--is, as we shall  see at a later stage, approximately related to the fictitious transit  time of a
 pulse to the apex and back. This is in accordance  with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a  conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to  the cone continued to the apex."

Do I need to simplify it? "The period of the sounding wave is longer than the period of the traveling wave. The little missing bit that brings that together based on the reed behavior is, rightly enough, just about equal to the extra time it would take the wave to go out to the apex and get
 reflected back. This explains how a shorter tube can act like a longer tube, not too short, and not too long, but just right like a complete cone should. And now, boys and girls, we know why a truncated cone with a physically short substitution can have the same sounding length as a complete
 cone, and we can live happily ever after...."

Joe Wolfe puts it like this:

Informally, we could can describe it this way: imagine a pulse of air  flowing up the bore towards the reed, in both a complete cone and a real  saxophone. In the saxophone, the air arrives at the mouthpiece and  starts pouring into it, gradually raising the pressure. When the  pressure is high
 enough, it forces the air back, and a reflection has  occurred. Of course, the bigger the volume of the mouthpiece, the longer  it takes before the pressure builds up and the reflection occurs.  Meanwhile, the pulse in the complete cone is completing the longer path  to the end of the bore, and
 then its reflection occurs.

Of course Rocaboy is way beyond this kindergarten explanation, but the result is the same.

 from the theoretical apex to the open tone hole/bell and back to the apex .  This is Benade&#39;s, and everyone elses, description of a complete cycle for any conical woodwind.- 2 x length.  Correct?

To this definition/time period, Rocaboy adds the time of a double transit from the theoretical apex to the truncation constriction, and back, for reed closure.  So Rocaboy&#39;s cylcle consists of the following transits:

reed tip (theoretical apex) to open tone hole/bell to reed tip (theoretical apex) to truncation constriction, to theoretical apex.

                                     What I read is that AA&#39; is the transit cycle from  the reed tip to the open tonehole/bell and back.  Then A&#39;B, the time of the closure of the reed which is related to the ficticious transit time to the imaginary apex and back is added to that transit cycle from
 the reed tip to form the periodic time of oscillation which can be  represented by AB.

Rockaboy goes on to say:  "This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to its apex".

Benade&#39;s  Frs = v/2xo  for the frequency of the missing cone given its length xo is completely congruous with Rocaboy&#39;s reed cycle in conical woodwinds findings.

If we all understood the math, and were up to date with all the literature, that might be different. But as John says, we end up arguing minutiae, most of which we don&#39;t even begin to understand

            <pre class='message__body'>Two further points. The rest of the paper appears to be about the physical mechanism of the tau period. This is where the concept of free oscillation comes in, which I did not read carefully. 

It is also worth noting that this paper was published 21 years ago. If Rocaboy had really discovered that the sounding length of a conic woodwind was one extra truncation longer than what the theory says and practice shows, it would have been discussed somewhere else by now.

kymarto123@... wrote:                                           You&#39;ve got it all wrong. The period of the sounding wave is AB: this is the time between compression waves. AA&#39; (on the pressure chart, corresponding to theta on the displacement chart) is the period between when the compression
 wave is sent out from the reed and returns to the reed, which is  shorter by the period tau (or A&#39;B) than the sounding period. The whole point of the exercise is how tau (or A&#39;B on the pressure chart) gets added to theta: how a physical cone + reed/mpc that is shorter than a full cone still
 manages to have the sounding frequency of a full cone. The returning  wave closes the reed at AA&#39;, triggering a new rarefaction which keeps the reed closed for the period A&#39;B before the reed reopens.
 
 There is no AA; AA&#39; is the actual time period of reed tip--end--reed tip (NOT to the theoretical end of the cone). 
 
 Now read this again:
 
 "The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time  of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;). The extra time (A&#39;B) or  (t)--roughly equal to the time of closure of the reed--is, as we shall  see at a later stage, approximately related to the fictitious transit  time of a 
 pulse to the apex and back. This is in accordance  with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a  conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to  the cone continued to the apex."
 
 Do I need to simplify it? "The period of the sounding wave is longer than the period of the traveling wave. The little missing bit that brings that together based on the reed behavior is, rightly enough, just about equal to the extra time it would take the wave to go out to the apex and get 
 reflected back. This explains how a shorter tube can act like a longer tube, not too short, and not too long, but just right like a complete cone should. And now, boys and girls, we know why a truncated cone with a physically short substitution can have the same sounding length as a complete 
 cone, and we can live happily ever after...."
 
 Joe Wolfe puts it like this:
 
 Informally, we could can describe it this way: imagine a pulse of air  flowing up the bore towards the reed, in both a complete cone and a real  saxophone. In the saxophone, the air arrives at the mouthpiece and  starts pouring into it, gradually raising the pressure. When the  pressure is high 
 enough, it forces the air back, and a reflection has  occurred. Of course, the bigger the volume of the mouthpiece, the longer  it takes before the pressure builds up and the reflection occurs.  Meanwhile, the pulse in the complete cone is completing the longer path  to the end of the bore, and 
 then its reflection occurs.
 
 Of course Rocaboy is way beyond this kindergarten explanation, but the result is the same.

                                      If "AA" is the transit cycle from the reed tip, to the  open tone hole/bell, and back to the reed tip, two lengths of the entire air column, then that time period is equal to traveling at the speed of sound, going from the theoretical apex to the open tone
 hole/bell and back to the apex .  This is Benade&#39;s, and everyone elses, description of a  complete cycle for any conical woodwind.- 2 x length.  Correct?
 
 To this definition/time period, Rocaboy adds the time of a double transit from the theoretical apex to the truncation constriction, and back, for reed closure.  So Rocaboy&#39;s cylcle consists of the following transits:
 
 reed tip (theoretical apex) to open tone hole/bell to reed tip (theoretical apex) to truncation constriction, to theoretical apex.

                                      What I read is that AA&#39; is the transit cycle from  the reed tip to the open tonehole/bell and back.  Then A&#39;B, the time of the closure of the reed which  is related to the ficticious transit time to the imaginary apex and back is added to that transit cycle
 from the reed tip to form the periodic time of oscillation which can be  represented by AB.
 
 Rockaboy goes on to say:  "This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to its apex".
 
 Benade&#39;s  Frs = v/2xo  for the frequency of the missing cone given its length xo is completely congruous with Rocaboy&#39;s reed cycle in conical woodwinds findings.

            <pre class='message__body'>You are overlooking the simple fact that in computing the wave cycle/frequency of a conical instrument using the formula that the the wavelength of the sound wave is twice the length of the instrument, Benade and others include the length of the missing cone in the "length of the instrument".

In addition I agree with everything Kymarto wrote.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

I&#39;m familiar with your recount of Joe&#39;s description of the wave and the mouthpiece.  It was in response to your specific question about how the physically shorter mouthpiece, because of it&#39;s cavity volume could behave as the equivalent of a longer theoretical completed cone - how the traveling wave could travel from the reed tip, to the open tone hole, and back to the reed tip, in the same amount of time that it would go from the apex to the open tone hole, and back to the apex in the theoretically completed cone.  There was absolutely no reference made to the reed closed phase, where it starts, how long it lasts, and why, in neither you question nor in his answer, though you now seem to think that there is.  This appears to be used here as a "Joker is Wild" explanation, that can prove anything:-)

Here is the problem with your explanation.  Rocaboy states that when the reed closes, the cavity resonance, a wave traveling from the reed tip to the truncation and back takes approximately the same amount of time as for the same wave to travel from the theoretical apex to the truncation, and back. ....and that, "This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period
 of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of
 length equal to the cone continued to the apex.".  OK?

Then, as per above, the new traveling + wave goes from the reed tip to the truncation, in the same amount of time that it would go from the theoretical apex to the truncation (same air column.  same cavity. why not?).  It then goes down the conical tube, to the open tone hole, and back to the truncation, in however long that takes.  It then makes the return trip from the truncation to the reed tip, (as per above) in the same amount of time it would take to go from the truncation to the theoretical apex.

So, the time for one complete cycle is equivalent to the segments, (reed open) apex to truncation, truncation to tone hole and back, truncation to apex (reed closes), apex to truncation, and truncation to apex (reed opens).

It doesn&#39;t add up to your explanation.  There must be some factor missing still.

      Two further points. The rest of the paper appears to be about the physical mechanism of the tau period. This is where the concept of free oscillation comes in, which I did not read carefully. 



It is also worth noting that this paper was published 21 years ago. If Rocaboy had really discovered that the sounding length of a conic woodwind was one extra truncation longer than what the theory says and practice shows, it would have been discussed somewhere else by now.



kymarto123@... wrote:                                      You&#39;ve got it all wrong. The period of the sounding wave is AB: this is the time between compression waves. AA&#39; (on the pressure chart, corresponding to theta on the
 displacement chart) is the period between when the compression wave is sent out from the reed and returns to the reed, which is  shorter by the period tau (or A&#39;B) than the sounding period. The whole point of the exercise is how tau (or A&#39;B on the pressure chart) gets added to theta: how a
 physical cone + reed/mpc that is shorter than a full cone still manages to have the sounding frequency of a full cone. The returning  wave closes the reed at AA&#39;, triggering a new rarefaction which keeps the reed closed for the period A&#39;B before the reed reopens.

 

 There is no AA; AA&#39; is the actual time period of reed tip--end--reed tip (NOT to the theoretical end of the cone). 

 

 Now read this again:

 

 "The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time  of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;). The extra time (A&#39;B) or  (t)--roughly equal to the time of closure of the reed--is, as we shall  see at a later stage, approximately related to the fictitious transit  time of a 
 pulse to the apex and back. This is in accordance  with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a  conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to  the cone continued to the apex."

 

 Do I need to simplify it? "The period of the sounding wave is longer than the period of the traveling wave. The little missing bit that brings that together based on the reed behavior is, rightly enough, just about equal to the extra time it would take the wave to go out to the apex and get 
 reflected back. This explains how a shorter tube can act like a longer tube, not too short, and not too long, but just right like a complete cone should. And now, boys and girls, we know why a truncated cone with a physically short substitution can have the same sounding length as a complete 
 cone, and we can live happily ever after...."

 

 Joe Wolfe puts it like this:

 

 Informally, we could can describe it this way: imagine a pulse of air  flowing up the bore towards the reed, in both a complete cone and a real  saxophone. In the saxophone, the air arrives at the mouthpiece and  starts pouring into it, gradually raising the pressure. When the  pressure is high 
 enough, it forces the air back, and a reflection has  occurred. Of course, the bigger the volume of the mouthpiece, the longer  it takes before the pressure builds up and the reflection occurs.  Meanwhile, the pulse in the complete cone is completing the longer path  to the end of the bore, and 
 then its reflection occurs.

 

 Of course Rocaboy is way beyond this kindergarten explanation, but the result is the same.

 To this definition/time period, Rocaboy adds the time of a double transit from the theoretical apex to the truncation constriction, and back, for reed closure.  So Rocaboy&#39;s cylcle consists of the following transits:

 

 reed tip (theoretical apex) to open tone hole/bell to reed tip (theoretical apex) to truncation constriction, to theoretical apex.

                                      What I read is that AA&#39; is the transit cycle from  the reed tip to the open tonehole/bell and back.  Then A&#39;B, the time of the closure of the reed which 
 is related to the ficticious transit time to the imaginary apex and back is added to that transit cycle from the reed tip to form the periodic time of oscillation which can be  represented by AB.

 

 Rockaboy goes on to say:  "This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to its apex".

 

 Benade&#39;s  Frs = v/2xo  for the frequency of the missing cone given its length xo is completely congruous with Rocaboy&#39;s reed cycle in conical woodwinds findings.

      Toby,

I&#39;m familiar with your recount of Joe&#39;s description of the wave and the mouthpiece.  It was in response to your specific question about how the physically shorter mouthpiece, because of it&#39;s cavity volume could behave as the equivalent of a longer theoretical completed cone - how the traveling wave could travel from the reed tip, to the open tone hole, and back to the reed tip, in the same amount of time that it would go from the apex to the open tone hole, and back to the apex in the theoretically completed cone.  There was absolutely no reference made to the reed closed phase, where it starts, how long it lasts, and why, in neither you question nor in his answer, though you now seem to think that there is.  This appears to be used here as a "Joker is Wild" explanation, that can prove anything:-)

Here is the problem with your
 explanation.  Rocaboy states that when the reed closes, the cavity resonance, a wave traveling from the reed tip to the truncation and back takes approximately the same amount of time as for the same wave to travel from the theoretical apex to the truncation, and back. ....and that, "This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period
 of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of
 length equal to the cone continued to the apex.".  OK?

Then, as per above, the new traveling + wave goes from the reed tip to the truncation, in the same amount of time that it would go from the theoretical apex to the truncation (same air column.  same cavity. why not?).  It then goes down the conical tube, to the open tone hole, and back to the truncation, in however long that takes.  It then makes the return trip from the truncation to the reed tip, (as per above) in the same amount of time it would take to go from the truncation to the theoretical apex.

So, the time for one complete cycle is equivalent to the segments, (reed open) apex to truncation, truncation to tone hole and back, truncation to apex (reed closes), apex to truncation, and truncation to apex (reed opens).

It doesn&#39;t add up to your explanation.  There must be some factor missing still.

      Two further points. The rest of the paper appears to be about the physical mechanism of the tau period. This is where the concept of free oscillation comes in, which I did not read carefully. 



It is also worth noting that this paper was published 21 years ago. If Rocaboy had really discovered that the sounding length of a conic woodwind was one extra truncation longer than what the theory says and practice shows, it would have been discussed somewhere else by now.



kymarto123@ybb.ne.jp wrote:                                      You&#39;ve got it all wrong. The period of the sounding wave is AB: this is the time between compression waves. AA&#39; (on the pressure chart, corresponding to theta on the
 displacement chart) is the period between when the compression wave is sent out from the reed and returns to the reed, which is  shorter by the period tau (or A&#39;B) than the sounding period. The whole point of the exercise is how tau (or A&#39;B on the pressure chart) gets added to theta: how a
 physical cone + reed/mpc that is shorter than a full cone still manages to have the sounding frequency of a full cone. The returning  wave closes the reed at AA&#39;, triggering a new rarefaction which keeps the reed closed for the period A&#39;B before the reed reopens.

 

 There is no AA; AA&#39; is the actual time period of reed tip--end--reed tip (NOT to the theoretical end of the cone). 

 

 Now read this again:

 

 "The periodic time of oscillation corresponds to (AB) but the time  of double transit of the tube (theta) is (AA&#39;). The extra time (A&#39;B) or  (t)--roughly equal to the time of closure of the reed--is, as we shall  see at a later stage, approximately related to the fictitious transit  time of a 
 pulse to the apex and back. This is in accordance  with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a  conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to  the cone continued to the apex."

 

 Do I need to simplify it? "The period of the sounding wave is longer than the period of the traveling wave. The little missing bit that brings that together based on the reed behavior is, rightly enough, just about equal to the extra time it would take the wave to go out to the apex and get 
 reflected back. This explains how a shorter tube can act like a longer tube, not too short, and not too long, but just right like a complete cone should. And now, boys and girls, we know why a truncated cone with a physically short substitution can have the same sounding length as a complete 
 cone, and we can live happily ever after...."

 

 Joe Wolfe puts it like this:

 

 Informally, we could can describe it this way: imagine a pulse of air  flowing up the bore towards the reed, in both a complete cone and a real  saxophone. In the saxophone, the air arrives at the mouthpiece and  starts pouring into it, gradually raising the pressure. When the  pressure is high 
 enough, it forces the air back, and a reflection has  occurred. Of course, the bigger the volume of the mouthpiece, the longer  it takes before the pressure builds up and the reflection occurs.  Meanwhile, the pulse in the complete cone is completing the longer path  to the end of the bore, and 
 then its reflection occurs.

 

 Of course Rocaboy is way beyond this kindergarten explanation, but the result is the same.

 To this definition/time period, Rocaboy adds the time of a double transit from the theoretical apex to the truncation constriction, and back, for reed closure.  So Rocaboy&#39;s cylcle consists of the following transits:

 

 reed tip (theoretical apex) to open tone hole/bell to reed tip (theoretical apex) to truncation constriction, to theoretical apex.

                                      What I read is that AA&#39; is the transit cycle from  the reed tip to the open tonehole/bell and back.  Then A&#39;B, the time of the closure of the reed which 
 is related to the ficticious transit time to the imaginary apex and back is added to that transit cycle from the reed tip to form the periodic time of oscillation which can be  represented by AB.

 

 Rockaboy goes on to say:  "This is in accordance with the simple theoretical notion that the period of a wave in a conical tube is equal to that in an open-end cylinder of length equal to the cone continued to its apex".

 

 Benade&#39;s  Frs = v/2xo  for the frequency of the missing cone given its length xo is completely congruous with Rocaboy&#39;s reed cycle in conical woodwinds findings.

Lance,

Forget about what Joe says--that is what he calls "arm
waving". In terms of Rocaboy, I&#39;m pretty sure if I could
manage to wade thru the quantitative stuff, I would find
the explanation as to why the reed-closed phase (A&#39;B)
lasts just long enough to mimic the travel time to the
fictitious cone and back. I am yet unclear on what reopens
the reed at (B) to start the next compression wave down
the tube, nor am I clear on his concept of free
oscillation and what it means to turn it into an
overdamped oscillation. But in terms of the sounding
length being that of the complete cone: I don&#39;t see any
contradiction of that in what he writes.

Lance,



Forget about what Joe says--that is what he calls "arm

waving". In terms of Rocaboy, I&#39;m pretty sure if I could

manage to wade thru the quantitative stuff, I would find

the explanation as to why the reed-closed phase (A&#39;B)

lasts just long enough to mimic the travel time to the

fictitious cone and back. I am yet unclear on what reopens

the reed at (B) to start the next compression wave down

the tube, nor am I clear on his concept of free

oscillation and what it means to turn it into an

overdamped oscillation. But in terms of the sounding

length being that of the complete cone: I don&#39;t see any

contradiction of that in what he writes.

"Rocaboy states that when the reed closes, the cavity resonance, a wave 
traveling from the reed tip to the truncation and back takes 
approximately the same amount of time as for the same wave to travel 
from the theoretical apex to the truncation, and back. .."

Nowhere does the author of the study discuss the wave traveling from the
reed tip to the "truncation" and back.  What the study clearly says is
that the time the reed remains closed approximates the ficticious
transit  time of a pulse to the apex and back.

Therefore the time of one complete cycle is:

  - the time of double transit defined by the fingering [length of the
tube]  (reed open) PLUS

- the time the reed remains closed  before the reed "springs" open again
generating the next compression and beginning a new cycle.

It is interesting to note that the interval the reed remains closed can
be shortened by increased blowing pressure or lip pressure which raises
the pitch.  In such instances the closure time of the reed does not
match the ficticious transit time to the apex and back.   This lends
credence to my theory that playing  the correct mouthpiece pitch, or the
mouthpiece + neck pitch [FRS] is an important corollary to having the
equivalent mouthpiece volume match that of the missing cone, in order to
meet Benade&#39;s two requirements for the instrument to "work properly".

This study begs the question:  What is the reed movement cycle on a
saxophone played at softer dynamic levels where the reed does not close,
but simply oscillates?   The pitch of the note produced is still
determined by the length from the opening to the imaginary apex.  So in
that instance what adds to the period of the wave to give it that added
dimension and resulting pitch?

            <pre class='message__body'>What I find most intriguing in the study is the fact that
cone angle is a determinant in the reed-closed phase but
that it is independent of fingering. So it cannot be a
simple reflection at the truncation, since in that case it
would seem that the critical determinant would be the
truncation diameter. Nor is it a simple function of the
mass in the air column, since on that case the tube length
should be significant. Hmmmm.....I&#39;m going to have to try
to wade through the formulae with my primitive math...

            <pre class='message__body'>Since the neck (bocal) bore is expanding, at some point the air ceases to act as a mass.

"At that stage, a free oscillation of a spring-mass system was introduced to explain the reed reopening. The reed was considered to be a cavity in which the air was being compressed and expanded, whereas the air contained within the tapered entrance to the tube was accelerated under the influence of the pressure within the reed.

If the tube were cylindrical as in the clarinet, the inertia of teh air would be so great as to make the frequency of the free oscillation very low.  The reed would not reopen until a reflected compression arrived from the open end."

      What I find most intriguing in the study is the fact that

cone angle is a determinant in the reed-closed phase but

that it is independent of fingering. So it cannot be a

simple reflection at the truncation, since in that case it

would seem that the critical determinant would be the

truncation diameter. Nor is it a simple function of the

OK, I finally read Rocaboy carefully. Interesting stuff.
Free oscillation frequency is controlled by internal
volume and air mass in the aperture, and this latter is a
function of cone angle. Free oscillation starts as soon as
the reed shuts. What I don&#39;t quite get is that Rocaboy
says the free oscillation under playing conditions lasts
only 1/2 cycle before pressure rising in the reed causes
it to reopen. 

I&#39;m picturing the rarefaction at the reed tip traveling
through the cavity, hitting the aperture and inverting as
a compression to reopen the reed. But wouldn&#39;t that be a
full cycle? What do you think?

            <pre class='message__body'>In free oscillation, the cavity functions as a cylinder - a Helmholtz resonator, with a resonant wavelength of 4 x L (Nederveen confirms).  After 1/2 cycle, commencing with reed tip rarefaction transit to truncation(1/4 cycle), inverted pressure wave reflection at the truncation end to reed tip (1/4 cycle) where it reopens the reed. 

Rocaboy states that free oscillation begins before the reed is actually, physically closed, which explains how it could occur at low dynamic levels where the reed never closes.

OK, I finally read Rocaboy carefully. Interesting stuff.

Free oscillation frequency is controlled by internal

volume and air mass in the aperture, and this latter is a

function of cone angle. Free oscillation starts as soon as

the reed shuts. What I don&#39;t quite get is that Rocaboy

says the free oscillation under playing conditions lasts

it to reopen.

            <pre class='message__body'>Nederveen&#39;s model includes an extension of the conical bore, from the truncation to the reed tip.  This frustrum of air, together with the constriction aperture, behaves as mass.  Since the length of the "port" or mass, is a factor of frequency, the long, narrow mouthpiece will play at a different frequency than the short fat mouthpiece, even though the low frequency cavity volumes are correct and identical.  Rocaboy admits that the reality most likely lies somewhere between his simple model, and that of Nederveen&#39;s.

This is why Scavone&#39;s mouthpiece models are useless, though they are interesting.  If you manufactured two mouthpieces to his exact dimensions, the long one would have a lower frs than the short one.  

In order to actually play/tune them to A440, the long one would need to be pushed further on the cork, to raise the frs, resulting in too little volume.  The optimal solution would be a slightly low frs and too little volume.  

The short one would require pulling out, to lower the frs, resulting in too much volume.

These are the typical scenarios of mouthpiece mismatches.

      Yes, OK--1/2 cycle in a cylinder makes sense. One thing to

note is that tau--the reed-closed period--is determined by

volume of the reed and cone angle. Reed length is never

mentioned as far as I can see.

            <pre class='message__body'>I knew you would have to try to get around that ;-)

Because the typical mpc is hardly a Helmholtz resonator;
i.e., there is no large difference between chamber and
port, the concept of "mass of air in the port" hardly
applies IMO. Considering the thoroughness of Rocaboy&#39;s
model, I&#39;m sure he would have included a length parameter
if it applied to any significant extent. 

Also, as I keep saying, Scavone&#39;s models certainly pertain
or he would have no reason to include them in his thesis.
They show very clearly a large difference in spectral
response and a negligible difference in intonation,
showing clearly that the effect of shape is on the higher
maxima.

We won&#39;t reach agreement on this, so I think until and
unless more relevant material becomes available we will
have to agree to disagree.

JBT--do you see the irony? After that knock-down, drag-out
debate on SOTW, I&#39;ve come round to your view after all...

            <pre class='message__body'>I have followed this discussion with great interest.  However it seems to me that these last conclusions about mouthpiece shape and length represent a leap of deduction that is not well supported by the findings of either Rocaboy or Nederveen.

Can you "connect the dots" in a clear and understandable fashion so as to lay a foundation for the conclusions about mismatched mouthpieces represented on your website?

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

I&#39;ll ask you again then.   Did you email Fletcher to inform him of his mistake?  He did say that length is a factor.  

"IMO. Considering the thoroughness of Rocaboy&#39;s

model, I&#39;m sure he would have included a length parameter

if it applied to any significant extent. "

Well, that is some brilliant logic.  By including a description of Nederveen&#39;s model, and his qualifying statement, he did include it, didn&#39;t he? 

So, let me add things up.  In favor of length being a factor there is:

1. Fletcher&#39;s statement that length is a factor in adjusting frs - hard to dispute huh?

2. Benade&#39;s statement, "Elongating, widening, or thinning the cane increases Vtotal and lowers Frs.  This statement equates to, "Elongating the cane increase Vtotal.", and , "Elongating the cane lowers Frs.", so we have, "Elongating the cane lowers Frs." as a true statement, and inverse logic says the reverse must also be true, so, "Shortening the cane raises Frs.".  Nowhere does Benade say, "Enlarging Vtotal lowers Frs.", nor the reverse.

3.  Nederveen&#39;s model with projected mass cone to the reed tip and Rocaboy&#39;s descrption  - increasing the length (were the bore cylindrical like a clarinet, the mass would extend the entire length of the tube.) of the mass lowers the frequency - Helmholtz principle.

4.  My personal experience matching 20 mouthpiece to various horns

5.  Paul Coat&#39;s experience doing the same.


And against length being a factor we have:

1 Toby&#39;s opinion.

      I knew you would have to try to get around that ;-)



Because the typical mpc is hardly a Helmholtz resonator;

i.e., there is no large difference between chamber and

port, the concept of "mass of air in the port" hardly

applies IMO. Considering the thoroughness of Rocaboy&#39;s

model, I&#39;m sure he would have included a length parameter

if it applied to any significant extent. 



Also, as I keep saying, Scavone&#39;s models certainly pertain

or he would have no reason to include them in his thesis.

They show very clearly a large difference in spectral

response and a negligible difference in intonation,

showing clearly that the effect of shape is on the higher

maxima.



We won&#39;t reach agreement on this, so I think until and

unless more relevant material becomes available we will

have to agree to disagree.



JBT--do you see the irony? After that knock-down, drag-out

debate on SOTW, I&#39;ve come round to your view after all...

      I have followed this discussion with great interest.  However it seems to me that these last conclusions about mouthpiece shape and length represent a leap of deduction that is not well supported by the findings of either Rocaboy or Nederveen.



Can you "connect the dots" in a clear and understandable fashion so as to lay a foundation for the conclusions about mismatched mouthpieces represented on your website?

            <pre class='message__body'>John,

What I mean is, this chart has nothing to do with Rocaboy&#39;s or Nederveen&#39;s studies.  It is a result of personal experience and known acoustic fact.  I&#39;m sure one could create a mouthpiece with such a high, long baffle, that it would require a 4th classification, but for the standard mouthpieces that are offered today, this is an accurate guide.

      What other possible scenarios are there then?

      I have followed this discussion with great interest.  However it seems to me that these last conclusions about mouthpiece shape and length represent a leap of deduction that is not well supported by the findings of either Rocaboy or Nederveen.



Can you "connect the dots" in a clear and understandable fashion so as to lay a foundation for the conclusions about mismatched mouthpieces represented on your website?

Not to mention Joe Wolfe&#39;s statement to me that length in
and of itself is not important, Rocaboy&#39;s not listing it
as a factor, Scavone&#39;s models and Wyman&#39;s empirical
results with mpcs of more than 2 cm in length. 

To use "Lance logic", Benade was talking about oboes, not
saxes, and we know from Nederveen that the mechanical
properties of the reed are of prime importance. And also
from Nederveen we know that reed effects bring the pitch
down considerably, allowing it to play in tune even with a
very small internal volume. There are other significant
differences between single and double reeds on cones,
including the fact that pitch changes with dynamics with
double reeds but does not with single reeds. Apples and
oranges...

And Fletcher talks primarily about impedance matching,
including length ad one possible variable.

And you know what I think of uncontrolled, empirical
testing...

I remind you again that Rocaboy specifically does NOT
mention length in his careful analysis, which you so
admired before I pointed out that uncomfortable fact.

I&#39;m not sure.  I know that you do it all the time and post your opinion of your results on SOTW, as arguments.  Shall I quote them?

When you have successfully matched 20 mouthpieces to 20 saxophones, then you may know what you are talking about.  Right now, you don&#39;t have the slightest clue.

Elongating the cane lowers the Frs BECAUSE it also increases the VOLUME at the same time.

It is the VOLUME inside the mouthpiece, not the shape or the length of the chamber that determines the pitch.  As Scavone points out those variables (including baffles) determine the color of the tone by controlling the strengths of the higher harmonics.

            <pre class='message__body'>Your logic does not explain why altering cavity length, while maintaining constant volume, changes Frs.  Mine does.

Besides, we have Fletcher&#39;s statement regarding length specifically, "The impedance of the missing cone has its first significant influence at
 about the frequency of its first impedance minimum, so the best 
approximation is probably to match the resonance of the cylindrical 
mouthpiece to that of the cone at this frequency.  This will also be 
influenced by any constriction or expansion at the point where the 
mouthpiece joins the main bore, so there are several parameters to play 
with in addition to length and diameter."

      I&#39;m sensing some "Fuzzy" logic here Lance.



Elongating the cane lowers the Frs BECAUSE it also increases the VOLUME at the same time.



It is the VOLUME inside the mouthpiece, not the shape or the length of the chamber that determines the pitch.  As Scavone points out those variables (including baffles) determine the color of the tone by controlling the strengths of the higher harmonics.

            <pre class='message__body'>Length AND diameter. Both ways to change volume. Nor does
Fletcher mention maintaining constant volume, so the
statement is ambiguous at best in terms of supporting your
argument.

There is an interesting point that we have not touched on,
which is that when the frequency is high enough the theta
and tau phases become equal and therefore similar to those
in a cylinder. I wonder if this is a point where frs
becomes more critical.

What support do you have for this statement that altering cavity length while keeping the volume constant changes the frequency of the Frs (reed + its staple, reed + its bocal, or mouthpiece + its neck)?

      Length AND diameter. Both ways to change volume. Nor does

Fletcher mention maintaining constant volume, so the

statement is ambiguous at best in terms of supporting your

argument.



There is an interesting point that we have not touched on,

which is that when the frequency is high enough the theta

and tau phases become equal and therefore similar to those

in a cylinder. I wonder if this is a point where frs

becomes more critical.

      "Your logic does not explain why altering cavity length, while maintaining constant volume, changes Frs.  Mine does."



What support do you have for this statement that altering cavity length while keeping the volume constant changes the frequency of the Frs (reed + its staple, reed + its bocal, or mouthpiece + its neck)?

Benade&#39;s statement, "Elongating, widening, or thinning the cane increases Vtotal and lowers Frs.  This statement equates to, "Elongating the cane increase Vtotal.", and , "Elongating the cane lowers Frs.", so we have, "Elongating the cane lowers Frs." as a true statement, and inverse logic says the reverse must also be true, so, "Shortening the cane raises Frs.".  Nowhere does Benade say, "Enlarging Vtotal lowers Frs.", nor the reverse.

Interesting huh? I told you about this about a year ago.  You said I was counting angels on the head of a pin.  Do you feel differently now?  

At F3 the open/closed ratio is 50/50.  At low Bb it&#39;s about 86/14.

      You really make no sense at all.

      Length AND diameter. Both ways to change volume. Nor does

Fletcher mention maintaining constant volume, so the

statement is ambiguous at best in terms of supporting your

argument.



There is an interesting point that we have not touched on,

which is that when the frequency is high enough the theta

and tau phases become equal and therefore similar to those

in a cylinder. I wonder if this is a point where frs

becomes more critical.

            <pre class='message__body'>Have you collected any data throughout all of your personal experiences such as length the mouthpiece extends beyond the neck, the measured inside geometric volume of the mouthpiece extending beyond the neck, the "effective volumes" of the mouthpieces, the comparative pitch of octaves, etc., etc.?

I would be most interested to see a spreadsheet with these measurements to support the statements you are making based on "personal experience".

Also where exactly is this quote by Fletcher that is being batted back and forth?  I can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere in his text "The Physics of Musical Instruments" where he devotes an entire four paragraphs to the saxophone in his 733 page treatise.

Rocaboy&#39;s exact quote is:

"From 2), some process involving a time interval shorter than (theta) causes the reed to reopen. But as soon as the time of double transit (theta) becomes shorter than (tau) the reopening of the reed is fully controlled by the pressure pulses which are reflected from the open end of the tube".

Now, if the reopening of the reed is fully controlled by the pressure pulses reflected from the open end of the tube as Rocaboy states, and NOT by the oscillation inside the mouthpiece then:

1) Is the returning rarefaction reflected off the closed reed to the opening where it becomes a compression which opens the reed on its return creating a 4L wave cycle as in a cylinder, OR

2) Is there some other mechanism that opens the reed keeping the conical 2L wave cycle intact?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m really wondering if this is related to the frequency
at which frs becomes an important factor in intonation. I
have a strong feeling that this is a quite complex
question that neither Wolfe or Fletcher has time or will
to try to explain to a bunch of amateurs without
sufficient grounding in detail. Scavone was the
smartest--he simply declined to answer my questions at
all...

      I&#39;m really wondering if this is related to the frequency

at which frs becomes an important factor in intonation. I

have a strong feeling that this is a quite complex

question that neither Wolfe or Fletcher has time or will

to try to explain to a bunch of amateurs without

sufficient grounding in detail. Scavone was the

smartest--he simply declined to answer my questions at

all...
