            <pre class='message__body'>I use fine sand paper wrapped on different small files and follow with 
great accuracy the reed profile. After that I remove any scratch again 
with sand paper wrapped on my fingers :) (a bit of water and different 
grain size can help with HR mpc&#39;s. Finally I cut the tip rail with one 
strike on very fine humid and smoothed sandpaper (paper against paper) 
to obtain the final shape. If I have problem with rails I use a lens 
and the triangular file to reshape the contact areas. It is a good idea 
to protect the tip rail during this operation with some plastic 
adhesive stripe.
I hope this can help.
