            <pre class='message__body'>This is a spreadsheet I made to facilitate calculating the length and volume of the "missing cone" using the formulas given by Ferron in the book "The Saxophone Is My Voice".  Also included is the calculation of the resonant frequency of the missing cone plus the neck and an end correction taken from Benade&#39;s "Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics.

It is easy to measure the ID of the small and large ends of the neck with a digital caliper.  I found wooden craft beads on a wire to work well to measure the neck&#39;s length, marking the beads at the ends of the neck and then measuring the distance between the marks with a meter stick.

I thought it would be fun to compare the different measurement of different necks and to see how the calculations match up.

John
