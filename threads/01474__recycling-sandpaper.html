            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone tried washing the silicon carbide paper when it gets
clogged up with plastic, HR, etc...
I was thinking since it is waterproof, I could just scrub it down and
re-use it. Is this possible? Anyone try it?
Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>I vacuum my paper as I use it.  I went through a period of wet sanding
tables.  I decided it was not worth the wet mess.  I have not tried
scrubbing clogged paper.  

There is a tan rubber bar that is sold to clean power sanding belts while
they are running.  But this may do nothing on the fine grades used for
mouthpiece work.
