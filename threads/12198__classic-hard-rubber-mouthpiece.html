But this may not be needed if there are facing issues that need to be corrected.  I tell my clients that facing changes primarily address response.  But if the mouthpiece responds better for them, they may be able to sculpt the sound more to their liking without chamber modifications.  

Occasionally a client asked for a more focused sound which I think comes from a smaller chamber.  But they don&#39;t like it and the chamber needs to be enlarged in a follow-up adjustment.  I use temporary putty as a test when I can to see if they like going in that direction and whether they want more/less.

Keith, 
Your words are superb.  Excellent advise!
I think warmth in the center would mean (not too edgy)...my two cents.  
I think the client&#39;s goal is to get a dense, centered sound which isn&#39;t spread, and isn&#39;t edgy or bright.  Basically the objective being a balanced sound.
Keith said:  "if the mouthpiece responds better for them, they may be able to sculpt the sound more to their liking"
Bravo!  I too find that to make the facing efficient (reliable response and comfortable balance of resistance and freedom) allows the client more freedom to create their ideal.

  Hello you all,
I have a question. I need to reface a classic alto hard rubber mouthpiece. The client especially asked for more warmth in the center of the sound. 
What is the best way to achieve this goal? 
The mouthpiece i need to work on is the Selmer Concept mouthpiece.
Looking forward to your reply&#39;s,

            <pre class='message__body'>Sure, the request is kind of vague, but many players think of the sound in terms like this so if you're charging money then figuring this stuff out is part of the job IMO. Talk to your guy some more. If they're local it's easiest, but a phone call is always better than email. You have to be able to translate these concepts into something actionable, whether it's on Mojo's bright/dark vs. focused/spread space, or however it is you think about it. 

 All that aside, the Concept is basically the old Airflow, and Selmer has a preference for short facings. Your guy may need a larger chambered piece or a longer and/or flatter facing. The precise combination of acoustic, aerodynamic, and mechanical changes required I couldn't possibly guess without playing the piece.
