            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve just come into three "Four Star" model Link tenor pieces. None have been refaced. One has the original ligature. One has a groove in the biteplate. This is the model with no ridge, and a decorative circle on the shank with Otto Link Co. New York. Facings are 3, 3, and 4. Interesting trades/cash offers considered. Please don&#39;t insult me, I know what these are worth. Pics available. I also came into a Brilhart (?) like Boots Randolph used, mint condition, original lig, facing 6; and a hard rubber Brilhart tenor piece, #4 (plays fabulously!), and a near mint Brilhart hard rubber alto (#3).
