            <pre class='message__body'>Lately, there have been quite a few multiple mouthpieces for sale on eBay.  It&#39;s a good way 
to get a bunch of either rentals pieces or school rejects.  The rental pieces are usually 
better.  The school pieces have chips and poor rails, deep bite plate indents, etc.  They are 
also mostly plastic.  Expect to pay $3-10 ea.

Often, there will be two or three pieces for auction.  These tend to be higher quality and 
go for bigger $$$.   Vintage hard rubber can be found for $30+.

If you know your mouthpieces then you can look for specific types.  One can sometimes 
buy vintage hard rubber for not too much.  Most of the plastic pieces are made from good 
plastic that (hand) tool easily.  Try searching for 

     sax* mouth* hard rubber
     sax* mouth* hard*
     tenor sax* mouth*

Unfortunately, there are a bunch of us out there who have nothing better to do than snipe 
on eBay.  I&#39;ve bought horns for the two or three pieces shown in the pictures.  I give the 
horn away.  Of course as soon as the buyer posts your question like, "Can you tell me if 
there are any markings on thse mouthpieces?" and the response is "Not much.  A few 
numbers and a letter on the side of the gold one, the words &#39;Great Neck&#39; on the cream 
colored one.

You can also find "blanks" on the web, but  I think you&#39;re a few months from spending 
$40+/- for a Runyon or Zinner blank. 

Brilharts and Arbex can be sometimes grabbed for cheap, especially in small openings, 
and their plastic works like good hard rubber.  There are many others to search for, but 
you must do research and learn.

Keep your stick on the ice; and watch those tips and rails!

Contact me directly for such mouthpieces.  I have a number of 
unmarked Runyon 22&#39;s for a good price.  These mouthpieces are in the 
4-6 size range (.066"-.074"), play well now.  So, you can only mess 
them up or improve them.  I suggest you play them a bit, see how they 
sound first, which is quite good.

Right now I only have altos, no clarinet or tenor sax.  If you want 
those, I&#39;ll need some time to get them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Folks,

                  I would like to build up a list of on-line resources that
I can easily turn to for information on all facets of instrument repair.

The biggest question I currently have is: While this group is a fantastic
resource for all woodwind repair (although this group was meant to
specialize in saxophone repair; there are a large number of you who are
experts in clarinet, flute and bassoon as well) - Does anyone know of a
similar group for brasswind repair? 

 

Most of what I&#39;ll be doing during the next year could probably be best
classified as "Emergency Repairs". as I will not have any sort of dedicated
shop facility; and I&#39;ll be involved with a lot of other duties as well.

 

As some of you already know - I&#39;ll be deploying for Iraq in a little over a
week from now; where I&#39;ll be working as a musician in a National Guard band
(playing saxophone and EWI) , be the band&#39;s instrument repair tech, will be
working as the unit&#39;s IASO officer (basically; playing "cyber-cop") - as
well as being M240 and 50cal gunner whenever we go out on road convoys. I&#39;ll
be wearing a few different hats.. :-)

 

 

So - any and all information you guys can provide me will be most helpful!

 

BTW: Because of the deployment - just a little heads-up. I will most likely
be in communication with you guys during the year; but, I will be using a
different email address, and therefore - most likely a different account
name. For a heads-up; the email address that will most likely be used is the
following: newjazzsyndicate@...

 

Just to let everyone know. thanks!

 

Sincerely,

               Karsten J. Chikuri

 

 

P.S. - Also - If any of you have any good tips for emergency repairs, "down
and dirty" tricks, or what-not to maintain the playability of horns - that
would be most welcome too!

            Hi, i was wondering if anyone has or knows where i can get a bunch of

cheap mouthpieces that i can start learning on.  I want to at least

get some good practice in before i go ahead and start working on my

good mouthpieces.  I was also wondering if it is much different to

work on a vintage mouthpiece as opposed to a newer mouthpiece, being

that the material is different.  Also between rubber and metal

mouthpieces. ..im really not experienced at all.  Thanks
