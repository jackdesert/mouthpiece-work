            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve kinda been wondering the same thing, if we&#39;re referring to
measurements on the glass gauge with the successive feeler gauges. 
Where are the optimum profiles cataloged?  I know in the "File"
archives on this site we have all the measurements of the various
Meyer alto and Link tenor facings, and I recall some similar info in
Raplph Morgan&#39;s article (also on this site somewhere) entitled
something like "A Link is a Link is a Link."  But if there&#39;s any more
info somewhere--perhaps for some other brands of mouthpieces, Selmer
for example--that&#39;d be nice to have.  Even Erik Brand&#39;s infamous
chapter in the Selmer repair manual is frustratingly vague on this topic.

Cheers,
Doug

            <pre class='message__body'>The only ones I have seen published are the ones that were in early 
editions of the Erick Brand manual and the same ones appeared in a 
Ralph Morgan Sax Journal article.  They are of limited usefulness 
since they are for very closed tips and only use a small set of 
feelers.  I have also compared several mouthpieces listed to actual 
measurements of the same vintage mouthpieces, and they do not agree.  
The published numbers may only be spot checks of a single mouthpiece 
rather than production targets.  There also be printing errors.

I think the best place to start is by measuring mouthpieces you like.  
I did a lot of this but then I began to wonder if I was duplicating 
defects in the curves.  So I plotted the curves and began to smooth 
out the irregularities.  I like the results on sax.  Clarinet is 
another story.

There are several files in the Files area on the Yahoo MP Work site 
with facing curves you can try.  It helps if you know your way around 
Excel spreadsheets so you can manipulate the inputs for your needs.
