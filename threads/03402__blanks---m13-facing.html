            <pre class='message__body'>Merlin,

I have the spreadsheet with your M13 specs - is this the facing you&#39;ve 
been using?

.0015  37 (18.5 mm)
.050    28 (14 mm)
.010    22  (11 mm)
.016    17  (8.5 mm)
.025    11.5 (5.75 mm)
.035     4  (2 mm)
TIP:  .040"

Or are you perhaps using the radial facing for that length and tip?  Thanks.

Dan

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve only done a couple of radial facings on clarinets, and wasn&#39;t 
crazy about them.

I use the specs that I submitted here for an M13 facing, though I 
kinda prefer the M13lyre facing.

Last thing I did was to take an M13lyre, put a Kaspar facing I had 
specs for on the thing, and trim out the baffle bump on it. It&#39;s my 
favourite clarinet piece for classical playing now.
