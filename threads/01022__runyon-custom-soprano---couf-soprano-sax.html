            <pre class='message__body'>The Couf soprano sax mouthpiece is basically the same as the Runyon 
Custom, but I had noticed that the facings are stamped 5*, 6*, 7*, 
etc instead of simply 5,6,7.

What I have found is that the tip openings are the same, that is, 
Runyon Soprano Sax 6 is the same tip opening as Couf Soprano Sax 6*, 
however the facing length is not the same.  The Runyon sopranos have 
17 to 18 mm facing length.  The Coufs have a slightly longer 20 mm 
facing length.

I have found the longer facing makes the low end smoother for some 
players, without really hurting the top end response.

            <pre class='message__body'>Last I have seen of these is from WW&BW.  I donï¿½t think they are made
any more.  BUT, I have the facing curve, and can put this facing on a
Runyon Custom Soprano.  I do this for my sister, and for several guys
quite often.
