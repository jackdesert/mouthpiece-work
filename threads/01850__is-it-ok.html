For those wondering, William likes to play on .090" tip soprano 
pieces.

There is usually not enough material in the sides to open the tips a 
lot on vintage stubby soprano pieces.  You start cutting into the 
concave sidewalls and the window becomes wider than the reed.  It may 
be possible to angle the table (butt cut), but often there is not 
enough material there either.  Since most of these pieces start 
at .048" or so, it is tough to get .090" out of it.  I&#39;d have to see 
the piece up close and take some measurements to see if it may be 
possible.
