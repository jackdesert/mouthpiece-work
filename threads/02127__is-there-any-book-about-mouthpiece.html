For me, whatever I could get my hands on on the subject.  Forum 
discussions.  Private Emails among those with knowledge.  Trial and 
error.

I started this site to help fill the void of information on the web.

Look through the information on the MouthpieceWor Yahoo site.  The 
message archives list what litature is available.  See also the Files 
and Links areas.  There is no one source (book or otherwise) that 
will hand you all the information you want.

This is a good introduction to some basic mouthpiece features.  But 
it does not get into mouthpiece rework.
