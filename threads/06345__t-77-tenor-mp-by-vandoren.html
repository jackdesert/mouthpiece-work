If your client has one, measure it.  If he does not, he probably wont be able to tell if you get close.  ;)
 
On the Vandoren Paris site, it lists the T77 at 2.77 mm tip and a "L" facing length.  I have some old printouts that have some numbers for  Vandoren tips and facing lengths.  When I compared some spot checks against actual mouthpieces they did not compare real well.  Most tip data is for measurements inside the tip rail.  Vandoren and Selmer appear to measure to the outside of the tip rail.  They also appear to measure facing lengths to a theoretical 0.000" feeler gage.  That is, the true tangent of where the facing breaks away from the table.

Can anyone tell me the specs for the Van Doren T 77 tenor mouthpiece
or where I can find them. 

I have a client that wants something similar and since I have never
played one I am starting blind.

Thanks

Thanks for the advice. Client is in Fl and I am in CA and its his
number 1 piece so I don&#39;t think he will send it. Guess I will go to a
music store and try one. Of course it wont be near the same but it
will give me some ideas. I went to the Vandoren site too and got the
the tip measurement, thanks that does help a little. Very interesting
about the theoretical 0.000. I have a feeling since he used to play a
rubber Link that he is looking for something between a 7 & 8 by Link
standards that is just a good solid mouthpiece and not necessarily a
screamer. Thanks so much for your input. It did help me resolve what I
need to do.
