Like a new languaege, it needs to be started from alphabet, i.e tools

pros like MOJO, Steven, Gwindplyer,,,, to help us to start a new 
class and help us to learn this wonderful work. 
About 5 years ago I asked Freddie Gregory while he was in London to 
let me work for free for him as his health wasn&#39;t very good, but he 
didn&#39;t want to pass his 40 years experience to someone else. Lets 
hope that we get a better support from one of the professionals in 
this site.

            <pre class='message__body'>Visit the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site.  Go to the message area and read 
post number 9.  This is the one where I suggest getting started by 
getting the basic measuring tools and measuring any mouthpiece you 
can get your hands on.  

Re-reading the post, it holds up well.  Digital calipers can be had 
now for $30 or so.  There have been a few offerings of larger size 
feeler gauges which I recommend over taping smaller sizes together.  
But you can get them later.

I think there is no use working on mouthpiece facings until you can 
consistently measure the same readings within .5 or less on the glass 
gauge.  Otherwise your measurement error might tell you to lower a 
bump that is not really there.

The Files area has a number of useful files to read.  Look under 
Methods for:

Dan Torosian MPWork recap.doc 

Mojo on Reworking Steps.doc 

But do not get ahead of yourself.  I spend 3 months or so just 
measuring and plotting facings.

your attention on this subject, believe me I know that
there is a wealth of information in the past 5 years
postings and I admit that for most of tonight you guys
managed to get me to go back and start reading from
the very first posting, but by the time that I got to
the number 10 I found myself wondering or drifting
away from the subject and start looking on website
pointed out to members in those postings and after a
wee while you just want to leave everything alone and
that&#39;s what has happened to me over the past 3 years
of being a member of this group.

I like to let you know that English languages is not
my first language and it takes me a lot longer to read
the postings than I would like to and there are over
5000 of them!!!and please forgive any miss-spellings
or Gram errors that you might find in my writings.

As you can see there are already a small number of
members who would like to have the classes started
from scratch, I am sure there will be more joining in.

You have been with this group from the beginning an d
it is easy to say read the old posting, I can assure
you that we new students will read the posting as we
progress and understand thing better but we need a lot
of help just to get us started.

I noticed that there are 850 members but how many of
them are active and how many of the are like us who
want to be active but can not.

Thanks for listening

            <pre class='message__body'>I use common silicon carbide "wet or dry" paper.  This has a black or gray colored grit.
   
  For hard rubber and plastic mouthpieces you will need 600 grit paper for most of your work.  I tear these in half using a metal straight edge.  
   
  You will need lesser amounts of 800 grit, 1000 grit, 1500 grit.  This is for fine polishing, removing scratches, cosmetic work.
   
  For metal mouthpieces, cutting brass, 320 and 400 work best, and finish off with 600.

I think most chamber work is done by eye, no guages.  Beginners usually
start with various files.  You can also wrap sandpaper around files or
stick.  You can glue pads of paper on sticks too.  Extensive chamber work
is usually done using a high speed rotary tool such as a Dremel.  A flex
shaft and a foot-operated variable speed control is also handy to have.

You can get a feel for what different chambers and baffles can do by
comparing a bunch of different mouthpieces.  I think it is also a good
learning experiance to get a large chamber low baffle mouthpiece and try
some shapes inside it using temporary putty.  Dental wax works well but can
be messy to clean out.  Poster-hanging putty comes out cleaner, but does
not hold well to a damp surface.

After you get a feel of what you like, you can try to transfer those shapes
to another mouthpiece.  Use epoxy putty to build up surfaces.  Use tools to
shape it and remove material.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith for all the infos. 
I have a rotery tool like Dremel with a felxy cable
but no foot control but the bits that come with it are
not long enough to work inside the mouthpiece without
the machine itself hitting the mpc. Are there any bits
that I can get for it that the rod is long engugh to
work on mpc maybe from the shank area.
The problem that I have is a Berg metal the someone
has already done some work on the baffle and chamber,
the bit that looks like the head of the bullet does
not look right i.e. one side of the bullet shape does
not mirror the other side and I can not modify it from
the front of the mpc  so was thinking to attack it
from the end,,, also the rails are not the same one is
thinner than the other also the inside walls of the
rails are showing some filing marks,,,,,,
God help me!!!

After trying some kits of burrs, I purchased a selection of carbide 
burrs from Shor International.  (The kit burrs are OK for HR, but do 
not hold up on metal mouthpieces.)  Shor is in the Links area.  Most 
burrs are a standard 1.5" long or so.  I do not see the lengths 
listed now, but they used to provide that info.  A few were available 
in a 3" length.  I have a small flame shape in 3" L.

But I avoid using these in SS Bergs.  I&#39;m concerned they may dull.  
They are only around $3 each but I do not want to trash them.  If I 
need to work on a SS chamber, I use grinding points.  I get them from 
Home Depot or wherever.  I do not use them a lot since I quote higher 
prices to work on SS.  I have not seen grinding points in long shaft 
lengths.

I use a flex shaft attachment from Micro-Mark that is thin.  It is 
just a little larger in diameter than a pencil.  It can even reach 
inside from the shank end of a mouthpiece.  All other flex shafts I 
have seen are too large to do this.

I think most chamber work is done by eye, no guages.  Beginners usually

start with various files.  You can also wrap sandpaper around files or

stick.  You can glue pads of paper on sticks too.  Extensive chamber work

is usually done using a high speed rotary tool such as a Dremel.  A flex

shaft and a foot-operated variable speed control is also handy to have.



You can get a feel for what different chambers and baffles can do by

comparing a bunch of different mouthpieces.  I think it is also a good

learning experiance to get a large chamber low baffle mouthpiece and try

some shapes inside it using temporary putty.  Dental wax works well but can

be messy to clean out.  Poster-hanging putty comes out cleaner, but does

not hold well to a damp surface.



After you get a feel of what you like, you can try to transfer those shapes

to another mouthpiece.  Use epoxy putty to build up surfaces.  Use tools to

shape it and remove material.

I find them useful.  You can get an inexpensive but functional set at

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a coarse and a fine riffler file sets from Micro-Mark.  They were not
expensive.

I&#39;m interested in a Valitan riffler but I have not seen them.  I have a few
Valitan (Grobet) straight files.  They cost a little more but are very hard
so they stay sharp.

            <pre class='message__body'>File sets, also look at 
   
  www.micromark.com
   
  Rather than search the site, which has things you don&#39;t know they have and therefore can&#39;t search for them, simply fill out the form to be mailed a paper catalog.  It is free.
   
  I promise you that you will find tools you want, for mouthpiece and/or instrument repair.
   
  The catalog is mainly aimed at model builders, specifically, model railroaders.  But aren&#39;t the skills very similar?  
   
  I think you will find their quality good and prices acceptable.
   
  While on the site, take a look at their Microlux line of lathe and milling machines.  This is the same minilathe sold my others, but more refined.  It is a 7" x 14" lathe.  It handles up to 14" length, rather than 10" or 12" as with many others.  The accessories for that lathe will also fit the Grizzly, and other similar minilathes.
