            <pre class='message__body'>Today I got a new customer: A 80-year-old still playing jazz musician who had destroyed his Berg Larsen HR alto mouthpiece. The mission is to try to create a replacement for the old he has played in since he was young. He had one new and one old that I will use as blanks.

It&#39;s something whith hes old mpc that I had not seen before: In the chamber, it is a ring, which is made of metal. This create a constriction such as we find in a small chamber soprano mouthpiece. He said it was like that when he bought it new many, many years ago.
I have checked on Theo Wanne&#39;s website and mouthpiecemuseum.com but find nothing that can explain this mouthpiece. Are there any of you who know anything about this? It is impossible to read what is written on it.
I have posted pictures of it here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/89963544 @ N05/sets/72157633201784577 /

Teeth marks: I thought the mouthpieces  had marks due to wear and suggested that I should repair them. But he said, "no, no - this I&#39;ve made myself with a file, they are so nice to rest my teeth on". 
This is he playing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIxPxlaE5nA

            <pre class='message__body'>One of the countless things sax players have stuck in their mouthpieces over the years, in attempt to change the way a stock mouthpiece plays.  That makes the throat, in front of the neck narrower, which makes the sound more focused, while also changing the mouthpiece volume and playing frequency, necessitating pulling out on the cork.  It flattens the upper register.  Could have been done by someone trying to lower a sharp C#3 on a vintage alto, though it lowers the palm keys as well.
