            <pre class='message__body'>Many years ago we inquired and were informed that for the USA, we had to contact a USA rep/importer/wholesaler who handled resale in the USA. Many companies do the same. Vandoren uses DANSR etc. At that time for the USA it was Lisa (Argiris) Canning, then with International Musical Suppliers and now with Lisa’s Clarinet Shop..  I suppose that Zinner found it easier to take orders and ship to one wholesale supplier. That’s the extent of my limited knowledge. All the best.

 manufacturers like from SEM hard rubber for example?
