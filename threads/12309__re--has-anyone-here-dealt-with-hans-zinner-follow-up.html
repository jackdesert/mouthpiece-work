            <pre class='message__body'>Many years ago we inquired and were informed that for the USA, we had to contact a USA rep/importer/wholesaler who handled resale in the USA. Many companies do the same. Vandoren uses DANSR etc. At that time for the USA it was Lisa (Argiris) Canning, then with International Musical Suppliers and now with Lisa’s Clarinet Shop..  I suppose that Zinner found it easier to take orders and ship to one wholesale supplier. That’s the extent of my limited knowledge. All the best.

            <pre class='message__body'>Zinner states that they use "zinner" hard rubber,  how does it differ from other european or german hard rubber 
 manufacturers like from SEM hard rubber for example?
 are zinner blanks made from injection molding or from solid HR rods?
 

 cheers,
