Replacement shank rings usually need to be custom made unless you can pull one 
off a similar mouthpiece that has been damamged.  Sometimes you can cut a ring 
off a metal tube that is close to the correct size and then use epoxy to fill in 
the gap.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have an old obrien that has a chip in it. I took the brass ring off of that but it was too small for the fossenkemper. Dillon&#39;s brass technicians said they can make one for me.

Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>I recently acquired an HR piece with a crack in the shank. I would like to put on a shank ring to prevent it from getting worse over time.
 

 I haven't found any info online about this process.
 

 Some questions:
 Where can you get rings?
 How to fit them?
 What glue should you use to attach them permanently?
 What to use if you may want to remove it at some time in the future?
 Should I try to fill the crack with anything before applying the ring?
 

 Any responses would be much appreciated.
 

 Thanks!
 Mike

I can&#39;t see that you could go wrong with aluminum or brass.

Search the group archives on yahoo for post 10417 "Banding shanks", nice

the inside of the shank ring to match the mouthpiece, and makes it

I do similarly.  I make the ring from aluminum tubing on a Micromark Mini-Lathe (7x14).  I  use a round nose bit to put a final pass on the ring bringing it to a nice shine, then very fine silicon carbide paper as it rotates, up to 1500 grit.

I use 5 minute epoxy to glue the ring on. 

Before applying the ring, I use electrical tape (because it goes around compound curves) to mask off where the 
glue will ooze at the front of the ring.  I also mask off the outside of the ring.

I put epoxy on the prepared shank and inside the ring.

When I push the ring on the ooze goes on the masked areas and is wiped off.  After it cures, voila!  clean!

The taper kinda helps too, because the farther you force the collar in, the tighter the joint.
Of course, you can plot the taper and diameter on both to be almost exact, the difference of the glue is the variable.

            <pre class='message__body'>I purchased an assortment of ~1 ft long tubing samples.  But I found that nearly all HR, plastic and wood shank cracks can be repaired using a 1" OD x .030" wall brass tube.   I sleeve the entire shank.  So the ID is .940".  It is a loose fit on most jobs.  I use JB Weld or 5 min clear epoxy which fills the gap.  On tight fits, I use a rotary tool and hand file to cut down the shank OD.  I do not own a lathe.

If you want to be able to take the ring off to view the original shank engraving, consider using a small radiator hose clamp and trim off the excess length.  You might want to do this for say a Brilhart Great Neck NY.  

These photos show a shank extension job that is similar to a shank reinforcement.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby, there is a high-tech string that is made from carbon fiber.  It is slightly sticky, because it is impregnated with the right amount of resin to set it up.
The resins are set up in a variety of methods, which include heat, pressure, catalyst, and UV light.
The family of filaments is called "pre-preg" or pre-impregnated.
They can be jet black, and are 10,000 times stronger than hard rubber.  A few winds of it can be coated with black resin, turned smooth, and polished.

            <pre class='message__body'>Carbon fiber string  sounds expensive. Do you really need that kind of strength in this application? I have used strong thread, thin string and nylon fishing string. I usually coat it with a couple of layers of clear  nail polish to finish it off. The best way is to make a lashing like you do on rope so that the end of the filament is pulled back under the wrapping.
  It  looks  fine and quite  elegant , like a nice old  fishing pole or the the handle bars on the traditional cork wrapping on a bicycle.
  My old Selmer S80  bari piece is still fine  12 years after  this repair.    Peter

If you want down and dirty, turn down the very end and wrap with strong black thread, then completely soak the thread with cyanoacrylate superglue. The glue reinforces the thread and the thread stops the glue from cracking. It is very strong, and you don&#39;t have to manufacture and fit a ring. For looks you can sand and polish the thread, but obviously it won&#39;t look as nice as a ring.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry, Keith...Just mentioning it as a point of reference.I bought some sheet pre-preg for a bicycle project for which I was a consultant.As I recall, there were thousands of variables (strength, weight, thickness).I believe the product best for mouthpieces would be called "tape".Typically, a CNC machine "pays-out" the fiber along a known path (designated by the computer), and lays it up in a criss cross manner.There is no reason this couldn&#39;t be done by hand.The material had to be kept in a freezer.  At room temperature, it cures in about a week.  Typically, you wind it, then put the bike (or mouthpiece) in an oven.  It only takes 150F to cure it in 24 hours.

        [Attachment(s) from MartinMods included below] For the best results and appearance, the mouthpiece has to be put on a lathe and the end of the shank  turned down enough to fit the ring on so that the outer surface of the ring matches the outer diameter of the mouthpiece shank.  That insures that the surface is perfectly cylindrical - necessary for a good fit.  The ring can be made to match the original mouthpiece contour, if there is enough material to  work with.  The attached pictures show a repair done on a Selmer Soloist using stainless steel.

 Search the group archives on yahoo  for post 10417 "Banding shanks", nice description  by Paul Coates of how he does it.  He uses a lathe, tapers the inside  of the shank ring to match the mouthpiece, and  makes it slightly oversize, and  coats the mouthpiece shank and the inside of  the ring with epoxy to assemble.

    Carbon fiber string  sounds expensive. Do you really need that kind of strength in this application? I have used strong thread, thin string and nylon fishing string. I usually coat it with a couple of layers of clear  nail polish to finish it off. The best way is to make a lashing like you do on rope so that the end of the filament is pulled back under the wrapping.  It  looks  fine and quite  elegant , like a nice old  fishing pole or the the handle bars on the traditional cork wrapping on a bicycle.  My old Selmer S80  bari piece is still fine  12 years after  this repair.    Peter

     Toby, there is a high-tech string that is made from carbon fiber.  It is slightly sticky, because it is impregnated with the right amount of resin to set it up.The resins are set up in a variety of methods, which include heat, pressure, catalyst, and UV light.The family of filaments is called "pre-preg" or pre-impregnated.They can be jet black, and are 10,000 times stronger than hard rubber.  A few winds of it can be coated with black resin, turned smooth, and polished.

     If you want down and dirty, turn down the very end and wrap with strong black thread, then completely soak the thread with cyanoacrylate superglue. The glue reinforces the thread and the thread stops the glue from cracking. It is very strong, and you don&#39;t have to manufacture and fit a ring. For looks you can sand and polish the thread, but obviously it won&#39;t look as nice as a ring.

     That is some handsome work Lance. The taper kinda helps too, because the farther you force the collar in, the tighter the joint. Of course, you can plot the taper and diameter on both to be almost exact, the difference of the glue is the variable.

        [Attachment(s) from MartinMods included below] For the best results and appearance, the mouthpiece has to be put on a lathe and the end of the shank turned down enough to fit the ring on so that the outer surface of the ring matches the outer diameter of the  mouthpiece shank.  That insures that the surface is perfectly cylindrical - necessary for a good fit.  The ring can be made to match the original mouthpiece contour, if there is enough material to work with.  The attached pictures show a repair done on a Selmer Soloist using stainless steel.

           I pre-emptively banded a pair of tenor S80 mouthpieces, also shortened them a  tad. 
 Not having a lathe to taper the inside of a heavier gauge aluminum tubing, I  used some light gauge beach-chair tubing (I think that&#39;s what it was, had it in my scrap box), and filled the gap at the base of the mouthpiece with epoxy. 
 
 I can&#39;t see that you could go wrong with aluminum or brass.
 
 Search the group archives on yahoo for post 10417 "Banding shanks", nice description  by Paul Coates of how he does it.  He uses a lathe, tapers the inside of the shank ring to match the mouthpiece, and  makes it slightly oversize, and coats the mouthpiece shank and the inside of the ring with epoxy to assemble.

The original shank taper was cut down to a stepped (2 diameters) cylidrical shape actually.  No glue - a tight fit in a cool room keeps the crack closed at normal temperatures.

    Carbon fiber string  sounds expensive. Do you really need that kind of strength in this application? I have used strong thread, thin string and nylon fishing string. I usually coat it with a couple of layers of clear  nail polish to finish it off. The best way is to make a lashing like you do on rope so that the end of the filament is pulled back under the wrapping.  It  looks  fine and quite  elegant , like a nice old  fishing pole or the the handle bars on the traditional cork wrapping on a bicycle.  My old Selmer S80  bari piece is still fine  12 years after  this repair.    Peter

     Toby, there is a high-tech string that is made from carbon fiber.  It is slightly sticky, because it is impregnated with the right amount of resin to set it up.The resins are set up in a variety of methods, which include heat, pressure, catalyst, and UV light.The family of filaments is called "pre-preg" or pre-impregnated.They can be jet black, and are 10,000 times stronger than hard rubber.  A few winds of it can be coated with black resin, turned smooth, and polished.

     If you want down and dirty, turn down the very end and wrap with strong black thread, then completely soak the thread with cyanoacrylate superglue. The glue reinforces the thread and the thread stops the glue from cracking. It is very strong, and you don&#39;t have to manufacture and fit a ring. For looks you can sand and polish the thread, but obviously it won&#39;t look as nice as a ring.

     That is some handsome work Lance. The taper kinda helps too, because the farther you force the collar in, the tighter the joint. Of course, you can plot the taper and diameter on both to be almost exact, the difference of the glue is the variable.

        [Attachment(s) from MartinMods included below] For the best results and appearance, the mouthpiece has to be put on a lathe and the end of the shank turned down enough to fit the ring on so that the outer surface of the ring matches the outer diameter of the  mouthpiece shank.  That insures that the surface is perfectly cylindrical - necessary for a good fit.  The ring can be made to match the original mouthpiece contour, if there is enough material to work with.  The attached pictures show a repair done on a Selmer Soloist using stainless steel.

           I pre-emptively banded a pair of tenor S80 mouthpieces, also shortened them a  tad. 
 Not having a lathe to taper the inside of a heavier gauge aluminum tubing, I  used some light gauge beach-chair tubing (I think that&#39;s what it was, had it in my scrap box), and filled the gap at the base of the mouthpiece with epoxy. 
 
 I can&#39;t see that you could go wrong with aluminum or brass.
 
 Search the group archives on yahoo for post 10417 "Banding shanks", nice description  by Paul Coates of how he does it.  He uses a lathe, tapers the inside of the shank ring to match the mouthpiece, and  makes it slightly oversize, and coats the mouthpiece shank and the inside of the ring with epoxy to assemble.

    And what about material of the pipe? Is any metal strong enough if it is of  reasonable thickness?  
  The mouthpiece I&#39;m putting the ring on measures .893" outer diameter  at it&#39;s widest and .889" at it&#39;s narrowest. What inner  diameter size pipe should I buy? Or should I have a few sizes in the ballpark on  hand to do a little trial and error fitting?

When the mouthpiece is on the cork the crack is spread, gets full of cork grease.  There is 
no way you can get into that crack to remove the cork grease and clean the surfaces inside 
the crack, so no glue will get a bond to the mouthpiece material.

Banding is the only way you can stop the crack from progressing.  Whether you do it with

If you fit your metal band tightly at a cool temperature, it will never come off at room temp or warmer, as the hr/plastic is subject to more themal expansion than metal.  You don&#39;t need to glue/epoxy anything.

            <pre class='message__body'>I bought the Micromark 7x14 lathe (7" diameter, up to 14" length) and have been VERY 
happy with it.  I still have not explored all I can do with it, but I have made very nice 
shank rings.  For example, I have not yet learned to thread with it.

I did buy some asst sizes of Delrin rod to learn on, which is a self lubricating plastic that 
is very strong, and cuts very easily.  

I have brass and aluminum stock that I have used to made shank rings.

Anyway, an excellent addition to my shop.
