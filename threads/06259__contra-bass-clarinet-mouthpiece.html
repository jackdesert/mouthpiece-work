            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

I recently got a contrabass clarinet and made a mouthpiece for it.  
I&#39;ve played my entire career as a soprano clarinetist, so am just now 
delving into the low clarinets.  I wondered if anyone had any luck with 
contrabass mouthpieces and, if so, what facing curve you put on.  Mine 
is playing pretty well, and it&#39;s probably me just needing to learn the 
low clarinet better, but I just wonder if a different facing curve 
would be more efficient.  Thanks for your thoughts!

Hi, Ben.

I read you made a Contrabass Clarinet Mouthpiece. I m trying to make an Contrabass clarinet mouthpiece with a baritone reed.
I would like very much to see pictures of your own made mouthpiece if you can send me those I will be very gratefull.
I m a clarinet soloist of the Buenos Aires Philarmonic Orchestra in Argentina.

I will appreciate very much if you could reply me.

Many thanks.

Regards,

Matias Tchicourel.
