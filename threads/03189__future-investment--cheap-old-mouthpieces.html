I just got my hands on an old King medium chamber mouthpiece.  It has a 
long lay, a narrow profile, and a round chamber.  I opened it up to 
a .100 filed in a roll over baffle and darned if the thing doesnt sound 
better than half the expensive mouthpieces Ive owned or played.  Nice 
edge, full tone.  It has especially nice octave D voicing and 
projection. Im going to have to keep my eye out for those nice old 
rubber pieces no one seems to want.

There&#39;s a lot of decent designs that just need a good facing on them to work well.  I really like some of the old Woodwind Company pieces a lot (especially the Dick Stabile&#39;s).  Diamonds in the rough.
