Of course you guys are correct that they are all important.  But are 
they equally important?  (BTW, I did not start this poll).

C&#39;mon and pick one.  If someone was going to give you a random 
mouthpiece, and you were only able to adjust one thing from the list

I could not resist the poll and was pleased to see I had the same
choice as Keith. If the Tip and Reed had not been combined as an
option, I guess I would have gone for the Table.
If five choices had to be made, grading from * to ***** now that would
really test the grey matter, but I would hate to see you guys falling out.
    Glad to see Evan Christopher and Duke Heitger escaped Katrina. 
        They were over here in Scotland recently.

Assuming that the table IS flat and the curve is radial, as
recommended     for saxophones by Runyon in message 3537, what exactly
does does the tenor lay on the Guardala in the files section, do to
the blowing and tonal characteristics of that MPC, with its two flat
sections, similar to the 5JB clarinet &#39;piece, where it is supposed to
be beneficial from a jazz perspective ?

That is the problem with most polls I&#39;ve seen on sax sites.  There always
are a few options missing.  First you need a pre-poll to get nominations
for the list.

Then it is difficult to put all these "makers" in the same catagory due to
the different levels of hand finishing (and price).

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Roger... there are so many other...
 what about Freddie Gregory, Geoff Lawton or Lamberson as craftman... 
 or Larsen and Lebayle on big productions?

 Anybody have opinion usually different... for example here in Italy all pro and famous players are laughing when I said I use Fibracell (and I&#39;m sure on back side they said... how he can do or he have no ear), but I feel so comfortable that I dont take care, and with a good sound...
 And if you think how many people buy a Selmer only because is a Selmer, you easily understand how is getting hard job to find the best mouthpiece maker!
 
 Anyway best or better than other in absolute doesnt exist... as in Philosophy. When you think one is the best why to change, isn&#39;t it? but things are changeble, the quality, the feel, the test... today best is white tomorrow black, I like to think for what I feel, as this is the only way to make music.
 
 But I give you my idea, not abslolute, but close to my feel.
 
 Best of all with onor is Morgan... a genius head at the service of his hands. He make too a mid production, there are a lot of Morgan around. As refacing man he is one of the best. When you play Excalibur model, for me the top, you can have really all the best from a HR mpc.
 
 Than, I will say Barone... a man have two ways of work. When he wake up well the  piece of him is out better than any Link never played, NY or Florida or..... just unbelievable, same sound but more rich and powered. A luxury on this time of machine productions. May be the brass used have more copper inside or I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s fabulous. Today&#39;s best metal piece. Unfortunately there are many with big problem and they need to be reworked... or at least this is a common opinion. Did you see the few Barone for sell in the net? always retouched from someone, thinking are going better and than sold out by internet after spent other money.
 
 Another mention I wanna do for Ponzol. He is great and probably the best mpc maker compared with price.
 
 Hey Rog, on your listed I didn&#39;t see famous name as Sugal or Guardala. What&#39;s your opinion on those guys? 
 
 Ciao. Gian

You can find some old posts by visiting the Message area and searching for "bite plate" and/or "tooth deck".  Perhaps "epoxy" and "glue".  The search function is not the greatest so this is somewhat of an art to find previously posted information.  Yahoo only gives you one page at a time.
 
There is also some good beginner information in the Files: Tools and Methods sections. See also the Links: Tools and Materials section.

Enter your vote today!  A new poll has been created for the 
MouthpieceWork group:

Discussion on sax acoustic theory sometimes dominates the forum posts.  Most of this discussion has little to do with mouthpieces directly.  But it is difficult to discuss mouthpiece acoustics without considering the system as a whole.  As a member, how would you prefer these discussions be handled?
 

  o Allow them to continue as-is.  I can ignore/read each one. 
  o As that the discussion be moved to alt.music.saxophone. 
  o Ask that conclusions relating to mouthpieces be posted. 
  o I want to hear about percieved errors in the literature (Ferron, etc). 
  o I only want to hear about theory that explains a posted trial result.
