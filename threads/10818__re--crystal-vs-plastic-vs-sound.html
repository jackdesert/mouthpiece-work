            <pre class='message__body'>If the crystal is giving you the sound you want I say OK go with it. If not
I say the ear and the microphone do not hear the black mouthpiece as being
any specific color or material. It is kind of like golf the score does not
tell how pretty the shots were. There should be a good mouthpiece maker near
you somewhere to modify the crystal mouthpiece to your needs. I played
crystal for 5 years and just found them to tight feeling for my kind of
work.
