            <pre class='message__body'>I have been comparing three Vandoren M15 and three M13Lyre Clarinet
pieces. Playing characteristics are very similar between the two
models. After measuring all 6 of them, I find that the facings are
very nearly identical. The only difference is right at the tip. M15
seems to have a more open about 109 tip, compared to 107 for the
M13Lyre. Other measurements on the face are very consistent and almost
exactly the same including a relatively flat spot that shows up on all
six pieces in the region of the 0.024 gage.

My questions:

Have other folks measured these and found that the slight tip
difference the only difference between these?

Is there some other internal difference in the chambers/baffle/etc
between the two.

I only had three of each to work with. Do all of them have the same
flat sopt in the middle of the facing? 

My numbers (very consistent) are

          M15    M13Lyre
tip       109    107
0.0015    35     36
0.010     22     22
0.024     11     11
0.034      4      4

Thanks for any info.
