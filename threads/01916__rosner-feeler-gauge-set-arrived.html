            <pre class='message__body'>I just got my set of Rosner feeler gauges.  They are excellent.

They came well oiled, packed in a sealed plastic bag, and a strip of
anticorrisive paper such as comes wrapped around new firearms.

I wiped off the oil and measured with my dial calipers. All gauges
were as marked.

A few of the gauges differed slightly from the set I use with my
Winslow kit.

For example, the Winslow kit contains a .031" feeler, whereas Rosner&#39;s
feelers (like the old Eric Brand kit&#39;s .034") has a .035".  Measuring
several mouthpieces I found that the .031" gave a reading of about .75
mm greater than the .035" feeler.  On a Link tenor this gave a reading
of 10 mm for the .035" vs 10 3/4 mm (appx). This difference held for
several mouthpieces I checked.

The other feelers that differed, .048" (Winslow) vs .050" (Rosner and
E. Brand), .077" (Winslow) vs .078" (Rosner), and .093" (Winslow) vs
.094" (Rosner), gave exactly the same reading when measuring a mouthpiece.

While the .048" and .050" gave those actual measurement with my dial
indicator, the .077" and .078", and .093" and .094" actually measured
the same.  These are really probably the same thicknesses, and the
difference results from rounding off errors, not from actual
difference in thickness.  

2 mm = .0787"  and 3/32" = .09375"

I am sure these are the correct thicknesses.  Regardless, there is no
real difference, and these gauges may be used interchangably.

The only thing we need to adjust for when looking at the Winslow kit
measurment vs others is the .031" (Winslow) vs .035" (Rosner) or .034"
(E. Brand), is to realize the .031" will give a reading 3/4 mm greater
than the .035" or.034".  I don&#39;t have a .034" Brand feeler, but am
sure it would measure identically to the .035".

Thanks, Jeff!!!

Paul
