            <pre class='message__body'>This is how I&#39;m spending my Saturday: measuring and tweaking the final pre-production prototypes of our new
Saxgourmet Dragon&#39;s  Tongue tenor mouthpiece in Delrin....note the shank weight and the "threaded" tone chamber....there&#39;s nothing else out there quite like this

            <pre class='message__body'>the tenor was the first one…..there will be an alto and a baritone…..we have a bunch of designs we’re hoping to do in Delrin, including a sopranino……the acoustic properties of this particular variety of Delrin are just great! We currently make mouthpieces from brass, stainless steel, ebony, hard rubber, and a couple of different resins…..Delrin machines beautifully and sounds great!
