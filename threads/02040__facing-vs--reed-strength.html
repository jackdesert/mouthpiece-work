            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all - In general, do harder reeds require shorter facings?
I can imagine that it would take more for a harder reed to make the
bend around a longer facing and that is why I ask the question. 

Also - I should probably make the curve just a little flatter for
harder reeds to facilitate easier movement... ?
Thanks as always,
Patrick

            <pre class='message__body'>Patrick:  Actually, it is just the opposite... a longer facing makes it 
EASIER to play a harder reed.  It is a matter of leverage. 

 

Imagine this:  Stick a 2x4 board in your bench vise with only 2&#39; 
sticking out.  How much effort does it take to deflect it 2"?  Quite a bit.

 

Now, position it in the bench vise so that there is 6&#39; sticking out.  
Now, how much effort does it take to deflect the board 2".  Much less.

 

With a long facing the radius of curvature is greater, the reed has to 
bend less for each increment of deflection.

 

No matter whether the facing is long or short, or the reed hard or soft, 
the facing should be a smooth curve, no abrupt angular changes.
