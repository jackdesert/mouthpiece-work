Hi all,
I was wondering if this gives a mpc a certain quality all it&#39;s own. I
have seen some Lambersons that leave the enlarged chamber in a rough
cut state (not smooth). I did it with some of my pieces and it seems
to have  some effect on the sound... it may be just my imagination. 
On the other hand, if you are going to charge in excess of $250 for a
piece you would think one would take the time to sand it out...
Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>The smoothness of the walls does make some difference in the bore, as rougher walls cause more velocity loss at the boundary layer. That being said I would imagine that the difference in the mpc would be very small, as that is not a large percentage of the wall area of the overall bore.

Regarding &#39;hot rodders&#39;...I spent my formative years in Detroit (it
was the 60s), went to school to get an AA in Automotive Trades, and
spent a number of years building custom cylinder heads for drag racing
cars...

Polishing the intake and exhaust ports of a cylinder head produce
measurable increases in power, sometimes as much as 15-20%. Primarily
this is due to reduced air friction and turbulence wasting energy in
the gas stream. Today, FEA designs to improve the aerodynamics are
doing even better, along with careful dimpling/texturing (like
submarine surfaces) of the port surfaces. 

This is probably not relevant to our mouthpiece configuration,
however, as the velocities are very low, but it may effect the
&#39;standing waves&#39; in the mouthpiece, which are probably important in
enriching the harmonic content of the sound (this is speculative).
Just by way of observation, the Lamberson baffled pieces (DD and SB)
have much richer sound than other high baffle pieces; perhaps the
rough texture is part of that...

            <pre class='message__body'>Interesting discussion on the chambering texture. I wonder if one of you 
pros with a seasoned ear and a sand blasting setup couldn&#39;t take a 
couple of inexpensive plastic mouthpieces and by  sandblasting  one, 
come up with an answer that we would all be interested in.  I only have 
about 10 mouthpieces on hand, and they are so diverse that I think the 
chamber is more critical than the texture.  An earlier post mentioned 
playing with the chamber dimensions using modeling clay. That would seem 
to be less acoustically resilient than either metal or plastic, but then 
I had to encounter my 40 year old prejudices when recently someone 
posted the lack of discernible difference between a metal and a plastic 
piece.  The old ad copy that claims a brilliant sound from a polished 
surface may not bear out, and makes me wonder if it doesn&#39;t go one step 
further. We have all heard the (repeated, so it must be true!) advice 
about not relacquering a horn.  The old roadie horns that have the 
finish worn off are given as proof of this. Here is a hypothesis: 
perhaps it is not the lacquer at all, but the acid etched INTERIOR of 
the horn that is no longer smooth that contributes to the revered tone.

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually the only difference it would make in the air stream is at the boundary layer--about .1 mm from the wall surface. A rougher surface creates more impedance for the air molecules up to that distance. You usually find roughness effects are only significant in very small-bored instruments such as recorders and oboes, and/or when the wall surface area is significant in relation to the total volume of the bore, as in flutes and clarinets (and of course brasswinds.) It would seem that slightly rough walls would have much less effect in wide-bore instruments such as the sax (at least in the main body--there could be some significant differences in the neck.) The mpc surface area is so small compared to the bore as a whole, and the fact that the mpc is a pressure node where the air doesn&#39;t move much at all, make me think that a rough mpc bore wouldn&#39;t have a significant impact on the sound or response.

And any material hard enough not to be deformed by the pressure waves in the bore would work to make a baffle--it doesn&#39;t have to be very hard.

  JVW used to use crushed-up Sea-Shell paste that he got somewhere... 
  I don&#39;t know???   He used that on a paper towel wrapped around a 
  long narrow pillar file - to buff of scratches.  This after 
  polishing the facing and inside with 1500 grit paper.

     I remember thinking... "OK, is this truly necessary...?"

  I can honestly say there was a total difference in the way the 
  mouthpiece played before and after the final polish with the paste.

     With all that said and done...  Leaving the chamber rough would 
  create a certain type of turbulence in the air stream.  It would 
  also create places for saliva to collect or bubble-up making a 
  gurgling sound.

       If you want the air-stream to flow evenly and seamlessly - you 
  want a smooth surface.  If you want to slow down the air stream - 
  leave it rough.

        It all comes down to what is more important...  Time, or 
  finished product.  The way the finished product looks, is to some 
  people - more important than the way it plays.  I know it sounds 
  stupid - but that&#39;s been my experience thus far.

I think that any of us familiar with fluid dynamics should remember
that the air is moving real slow down the throat of the piece, but
right at the tip and early baffle, for the first mm is moving pretty
fast in a thin sheet. I only have one JVW piece, an old Meyer NY that
is my main alto piece, and I have noticed that it is a mirror finish
on the baffle for the first 5-6 mm, then polished but not so much. I
also notice when I pull it apart to clean it after playing, that there
is no condensation on the really shiny part, but little beads stuck
everywhere else...never thought about it, but that might be part of
the &#39;magic&#39; ("...anything sufficiently sophisticated is
indistinguishable from magic...")...also, my favorite bari piece is a
reworked STM that I personally polished the baffle excessively (or so
I thought at the time)

I will soon be marketing a way to MEASURE and GRAPH the tone with your 
home computer.
 
So, does a silver ligature make the tone brighter, a gold one warmer?  
Let&#39;s see!
 
Does Sax A with gold lacquer sound different from Sax B, identical but 
for silver plate?
 
You and I will soon be able to find out, and have a printout, a graph.  
Show all the overtones, their relative strengths.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ernest Ferron, in his book The Saxophone Is My Voice, discusses this 
issue, effects of interior surface texture, boundary area, etc.
 
Well, soon we shall be able to run an A/B experiment and see what is 
what, on paper.  But we are doing some things to make this more user 
friendly.
 
I once was trying to chose between two soprano mouthpieces for playing 
with the sax quartet.  Strangely, the one I heard (with me playing) was 
bright, everyone else heard as dark and warm.  The one I thought was 
dark and warm, they all heard as buzzy and bright, edgy.  Then I taped 
myself playing both.  The sounded far different from what I thought I 
heard as a player.

            <pre class='message__body'>>>>  Then I taped myself playing both.  The sounded far different from what
I thought I heard as a player. 

Then the question is what is more important?  How you think you sound or
how others think you sound?  How can you shape your own sound when you can
not hear what you want to sound like?

I place a lot of importance on how I think I sound.  However, when I heard
some recordings of myself, I initially did not care for the sound.  It is
like hearing your speaking or singing voice for the first time.  Over time,
I started to like the recorded sound too.

            <pre class='message__body'>When I use to record (many years ago) we use to talk a lot about how a player "printed."   The variables we talked about ran from reed to mpc to horn to microphone, effects (EQ compression), to recording room, altitude (recording in lake tahoe, nv is different than los angeles).  We also would talk about the "presence" of the sound on tape, not necessarily the captured volume; then there is the related concept of the subjective feel of a mpc which I think involve the amount of energy expended by the musician in connection with mpc/reed resistance; pitch control, articulation, and range; then there is the embouchure and position of the tongue; and the type of music being recorded, i.e., context.  I remember working with some real "industrial strength" players who live had tones exactly like Brecker or Sanborn only to "print" quite differently. 

I read in a biography that Coltrane was always running a tape recorder when he played or practiced.  In the end, the music is in the "ear of behearer."  (Dewey Redman)

Interesting thread...

I know that golf balls have dimples on them to increase their flight 
distance and have often wondered about that sort of thing affecting 
mouthpieces, necks, trumpet mouthpipes, whatever...

Have thought about bead blasting the chamber of a mouthpiece and 
doing the old "before/after" play test...  maybe I will and let 
y&#39;all know what I think, for wahtever it&#39;s worth...

Any smart types out there who have an educated guess as to what is 
really going to happen, other than possibly ruining a mouthpiece?

            <pre class='message__body'>Aerodynamics principles and analogies are often incorrectly applied to
describe the physics of what is going on in a mouthpiece.  Often the
results from the misapplication are quite good!  Runyon&#39;s arched baffle
work inspired by an airplane wing is a good example.

Standing waves in a sax do not have a lot of concern with lift and drag. 
Toby&#39;s post on the boundary layer effect is all I think is going on here.

I do not like to leave a chamber rough (as in Lamberson&#39;s).  But I do not
polish/buff them either.
