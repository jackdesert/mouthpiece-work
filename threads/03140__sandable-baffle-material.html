Fist, thanks Mojo for the assist on my metal mouthpiece.  I have 
experimented with handy-tac to form temporary baffles.  I fould after 
your suggestion that a fairly flat baffle along the floor added enough 
rise and/or took up enough volume to take out the tubbies from my 
piece. I know from reading that you use epoxy putty.  can this be 
easily sanded after it has set.  Id like to be able to tune the height 
if need be.  Thanks again.
