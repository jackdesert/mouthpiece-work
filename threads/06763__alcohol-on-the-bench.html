            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve had rubbing alcohol on the workbench for a while, but recently changed to grain alcohol.  I realized that, even though the isopropal alcohol was evaportated before I put the mp in my mouth, the warning label says the ingesting rubbing alcohol is bad news.

The uses for alcohol?
1) it disinfects the mp.
2) when used with a riffler file to "wet sand" it keeps the file from loading up.
3) good cleaner for oils, etc., if you&#39;re going to do anything with epoxy or even a temporary putty.
4) evaporates fast when wiped off.

My latest use was when I bought an old King HR mp and was curious whether the table was flat.  I wiped a little alcohol on the table and placed it on the underside of my glass gauge.  If you have too much alcohol, just move it around or wait a little and it will evaporate until you have the optimal amount.  The high spots touched the glass and, with the tiny amount of alcohol, turned black.  The low spots were then easy to see.  The mouthpiece was a mess, although it appeared to never have been worked.  It was easy to see that the lumpy table extended 4mm further down one rail.  The table also dropped off right at the shank, probably not too important.

You can roll the mp up on the rails, sort of like you would when using sand paper to open a tip, and watch the wet contact points roll down the rails.  It&#39;s interesting, though it shows big problems that you would also find when measuring with feeler gauges.

I saw somewhere that recommended a couple of swipes with sand paper right at the top of the window to ensure that there was a low spot there (to ensure that the reed sat down on both rails).  I tried it on this piece.  The "wet glass gauge" test shows the shape and extent of this low spot if you choose to do it.

I also did the wet glass gauge test with a cane reed just for jollies.  Not even close to flat, however, when warm, damp, and clamped to a flat mp table, I&#39;m not sure how important it is that a cane reed be perfectly flat.  I&#39;ll have to try it with a Fibracell.
