            <pre class='message__body'>
I searched through some old posts and it seems that dental acrylic was the preferred material for mouthpiece repair but that it doesn&#39;t really adhere to hard rubber very well. I work in a violin shop where they sometimes fill cracks in instruments with a mixture of crazy glue and corn starch. any thoughts about using that on  a mouthpiece?

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t think that would give you enough "working time"..I use JB Weld or a
similar two part epoxy

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m still looking for a good material to repair a white bite plate on my Brilhart.  I looked at krazy glue (cyanoacrylate) and decided against it.  First, it isn&#39;t completely waterproof.  The MSDS for it says it is soluble in water and alcohol.  I found posts on the web where people were complaining that krazy glue failed when used on their dentures (go figure).  Second, the MSDS says it is "dangerous" if injested (and didn&#39;t say if that was after it was hardened).  Third, cyanoacrylate is reported to be related to cyanide.  That was enough for me.

            <pre class='message__body'>it&#39;s available at most auto part stores and many home improvement stores.  It&#39;s a two-part epoxy, and it comes in quick and regular.  get the regular, it&#39;s stronger.
