            <pre class='message__body'>If you read the paper on the aero-acoustics of the clarinet, you&#39;ll see that what happens near the reed is extremely complex and poorly understood. We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

      If you read the paper on the aero-acoustics of the clarinet, you&#39;ll see that what happens near the reed is extremely complex and poorly understood. We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

 obstacle, only
 enlarges the perturbation.

Been there, done that - with a removable brass, window-shaped insert.  Thus, I say what I say.  All my mouthpieces have the ramp extended to the break, resulting in a reduced window length having a reverse "U" shape, which parallels the mouthpiece tip rail.  I reported on it 2 years ago on MouthpieceWork.

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

            <pre class='message__body'>If the physicists&#39; first order approximation (the grossest simplification of reality that has any useful validity) were sufficient to satisfy any musician, then you could convince them that mouthpiece shape (short and fat vs. long and slender) has no significance - since accordingly, all mouthpieces are the same.

If the mouthpiece designer actually wanted that much cross-sectional volume at the end of the window, it would be acoustically more efficient to distribute that volume equally, around the central axis of the mouthpiece bore, rather than to lump it all on one side, resulting in a lopsided air column shape and a bore obstruction - in the mouthpiece already.  

I don&#39;t know that much about shakuhachi flutes, but to adopt an argument style I hear often, "If shaks are so good, why isn&#39;t Yamaha making saxophones that way?" :-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 

Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 

If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.

There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 

John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

            <pre class='message__body'>"In wind instrument bores the primary mode of wave propagation is along the central axis of the tube." - Scavone.   

Mathematical modeling of irregular instrument bores is "well approximated" by a series of cylindrical and conical sections.  This modeling redistributes the volume of perturbations equally around the central axis of the air column.  While this approximation may satisfy theoreticians as to the perceived nature of reality, you will never convince a mouthpiece maker that a drastic enlargement in the side of the mouthpiece wall, resulting in a 2+ mm high, perpendicular obstruction upon entering the throat, is as efficient as an equivalent, though evenly distributed enlargement of the mouthpiece chamber around the central axis, resulting in a slight, smooth contraction of the bore upon entering the throat.  A 2+ mm deep enlargement in the side of the mouthpiece is equivalent to a closed tone hole.  Hmmm.

"Well, just remove the wall with a file.", you say.  As Morgan noticed, this removes the resistance caused by the ramp wall, but causes the mouthpiece to become less centered.   Small wonder.  The chamber is now larger, the width/length ratio is changed, and, if the mouthpiece volume/frequency was matched optimally to that particular instrument/player before, it&#39;s acoustic efficiency is now reduced.   You now have more volume in that area than you would like.  You have to start over and redesign the mouthpiece to get the original sound you wanted, without the resistance.  In the end, you will have a mouthpiece with as little cross-sectional window volume and obstruction as possible and that original window volume, distributed equally around the central axis of the chamber bore.

In this case, I would consider the saxophone mouthpiece makers to be the experts, not the theoreticians nor the shak makers, nor those who admire them.  There&#39;s nothing like having the actual, real experience.

I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

      "In wind instrument bores the primary mode of wave propagation is along the central axis of the tube." - Scavone.   

Mathematical modeling of irregular instrument bores is "well approximated" by a series of cylindrical and conical sections.  This modeling redistributes the volume of perturbations equally around the central axis of the air column.  While this approximation may satisfy theoreticians as to the perceived nature of reality, you will never convince a mouthpiece maker that a drastic enlargement in the side of the mouthpiece wall, resulting in a 2+ mm high, perpendicular obstruction upon entering the throat, is as efficient as an equivalent, though evenly distributed enlargement of the mouthpiece chamber around the central axis, resulting in a slight, smooth contraction of the bore upon entering the throat.  A 2+ mm deep
 enlargement in the side of the mouthpiece is equivalent to a closed tone hole.  Hmmm.

"Well, just remove the wall with a file.", you say.  As Morgan noticed, this removes the resistance caused by the ramp wall, but causes the mouthpiece to become less centered.   Small wonder.  The chamber is now larger, the width/length ratio is changed, and, if the mouthpiece volume/frequency was matched optimally to that particular instrument/player before, it&#39;s acoustic efficiency is now reduced.   You now have more volume in that area than you would like.  You have to start over and redesign the mouthpiece to get the original sound you wanted, without the resistance.  In the end, you will have a mouthpiece with as little cross-sectional window volume and obstruction as possible and that original window volume, distributed equally around the central axis of the chamber bore.

In this case, I would consider
 the saxophone mouthpiece makers to be the experts, not the theoreticians nor the shak makers, nor those who admire them.  There&#39;s nothing like having the actual, real experience.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

The shape of the cross-section (circular, elliptical, triangular, squared, ...) do not matter.



The curvature of the neck has negligible effects (contrarily to the curvature of the elbow).

 No. A circular cross section is not acoustically superior to any 
other shape such as ellipsis or even squares, they will behave the same 
if they have the same area.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

            <pre class='message__body'>That&#39;s fine, but Morgan and I were discussing the resistance inducing effect of a pronounced ramp wall/deep window, only 45mm (tenor) from the tip of the reed, and the effect of enlarging that perturbation even more by cutting down the wall in an effort to eliminate resistance. .  This process alters the character of the mouthpiece considerably, making it less centered/focused.  

I think it is universally agreed that in the mouthpiece chamber and baffle area, shape and volume distribution mean everything.  . 

If you disagree with what Morgan and I have experienced, and/or have some information that relates directly to ramp height and 
mouthpiece resistance it would be appreciated, but obscuring the issue, 
with unrelated facts (shak bores, unrelated quotes, etc.), just to 
disagree for the sake of disagreement, is of service to no-one.  Further, Antoine might not appreciate being quoted as you have done, seriously out of 
context, (i.e. "shape is of no consequence.:) where his statement is 
obviously incorrect.

      When a neck suffers some degree of "pull down", it is reduced in volume 
to some extent where the bend occurred. This has measurable and 
significant effects.



The shape of the cross-section (circular, elliptical, triangular, squared, ...) do not matter.



The curvature of the neck has negligible effects (contrarily to the curvature of the elbow).

 No. A circular cross section is not acoustically superior to any 
other shape such as ellipsis or even squares, they will behave the same 
if they have the same area.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is from the thread about a pulled down neck. It might be useful to add one more part of the quote:

"This is actually the case. Saxophone necks have non-cylindrical cross 
sections where they are bent. Some years ago, I unsoldered all parts 
from an alto neck (Selmer Series II, never pulled down) to measure the 
dimensions:


as an example, the external diameters, as measured top-down versus 
right-left, for one cross-section are 19.5mm diameter and 20.4mm 
diameter. The actual shape of the cross-section is probably not an 
ellipse but some non-circular shape, more or less symmetric, a bit 
egg-shaped or something else, as are most real things, non-ideal.



This does not matter, what matters is the cross-sectional area as a function of the distance along the spine of the instrument. " (my italics)

The "bend" caused by the offset of the volume resulting from a deep window is small, akin to the bend in the neck. It should not matter. If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

      When a neck suffers some degree of "pull down", it is reduced in volume 
to some extent where the bend occurred. This has measurable and 
significant effects.



The shape of the cross-section (circular, elliptical, triangular, squared, ...) do not matter.



The curvature of the neck has negligible effects (contrarily to the curvature of the elbow).

 No. A circular cross section is not acoustically superior to any 
other shape such as ellipsis or even squares, they will behave the same 
if they have the same area.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

            <pre class='message__body'>You are not following very well.  

The wall is the resistance problem.  It is caused by a lopsided volume distribution.  Distribute the volume evenly and there is no wall and no resistance problem.  Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

      This is from the thread about a pulled down neck. It might be useful to add one more part of the quote:

"This is actually the case. Saxophone necks have non-cylindrical cross 
sections where they are bent. Some years ago, I unsoldered all parts 
from an alto neck (Selmer Series II, never pulled down) to measure the 
dimensions:


as an example, the external diameters, as measured top-down versus 
right-left, for one cross-section are 19.5mm diameter and 20.4mm 
diameter. The actual shape of the cross-section is probably not an 
ellipse but some non-circular shape, more or less symmetric, a bit 
egg-shaped or something else, as are most real things, non-ideal.



This does not matter, what matters is the cross-sectional area as a function of the distance along the spine of the instrument. " (my italics)

The "bend" caused by the offset of the volume resulting from a deep window is small, akin to the bend in the neck. It should not matter. If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

      When a neck suffers some degree of "pull down", it is reduced in volume 
to some extent where the bend occurred. This has measurable and 
significant effects.



The shape of the cross-section (circular, elliptical, triangular, squared, ...) do not matter.



The curvature of the neck has negligible effects (contrarily to the curvature of the elbow).

 No. A circular cross section is not acoustically superior to any 
other shape such as ellipsis or even squares, they will behave the same 
if they have the same area.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

      You are not following very well.  

The wall is the resistance problem.  It is caused by a lopsided volume distribution.  Distribute the volume evenly and there is no wall and no resistance problem.  Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

      This is from the thread about a pulled down neck. It might be useful to add one more part of the quote:

"This is actually the case. Saxophone necks have non-cylindrical cross 
sections where they are bent. Some years ago, I unsoldered all parts 
from an alto neck (Selmer Series II, never pulled down) to measure the 
dimensions:


as an example, the external diameters, as measured top-down versus 
right-left, for one cross-section are 19.5mm diameter and 20.4mm 
diameter. The actual shape of the cross-section is probably not an 
ellipse but some non-circular shape, more or less symmetric, a bit 
egg-shaped or something else, as are most real things, non-ideal.



This does not matter, what matters is the cross-sectional area as a function of the distance along the spine of the instrument. " (my italics)

The "bend" caused by the offset of the volume resulting from a deep window is small, akin to the bend in the neck. It should not matter. If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

      When a neck suffers some degree of "pull down", it is reduced in volume 
to some extent where the bend occurred. This has measurable and 
significant effects.



The shape of the cross-section (circular, elliptical, triangular, squared, ...) do not matter.



The curvature of the neck has negligible effects (contrarily to the curvature of the elbow).

 No. A circular cross section is not acoustically superior to any 
other shape such as ellipsis or even squares, they will behave the same 
if they have the same area.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

            <pre class='message__body'>C&#39;mon Toby.  Look at a few mouthpieces.  Some have a straight, vertical wall of 2+mm.   Besides, it is well documented that any sudden change in bore diameter causes a change in air column impedance and a partial reflection.

      What evidence do you have that the "wall" (it is more a bulge) creates resistance, if it is not sharp enough to create a reflection or turbulence?

      You are not following very well.  

The wall is the resistance problem.  It is caused by a lopsided volume distribution.  Distribute the volume evenly and there is no wall and no resistance problem.  Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

      This is from the thread about a pulled down neck. It might be useful to add one more part of the quote:

"This is actually the case. Saxophone necks have non-cylindrical cross 
sections where they are bent. Some years ago, I unsoldered all parts 
from an alto neck (Selmer Series II, never pulled down) to measure the 
dimensions:


as an example, the external diameters, as measured top-down versus 
right-left, for one cross-section are 19.5mm diameter and 20.4mm 
diameter. The actual shape of the cross-section is probably not an 
ellipse but some non-circular shape, more or less symmetric, a bit 
egg-shaped or something else, as are most real things, non-ideal.



This does not matter, what matters is the cross-sectional area as a function of the distance along the spine of the instrument. " (my italics)

The "bend" caused by the offset of the volume resulting from a deep window is small, akin to the bend in the neck. It should not matter. If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

      When a neck suffers some degree of "pull down", it is reduced in volume 
to some extent where the bend occurred. This has measurable and 
significant effects.



The shape of the cross-section (circular, elliptical, triangular, squared, ...) do not matter.



The curvature of the neck has negligible effects (contrarily to the curvature of the elbow).

 No. A circular cross section is not acoustically superior to any 
other shape such as ellipsis or even squares, they will behave the same 
if they have the same area.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

            <pre class='message__body'>Agreed; I&#39;m certainly not talking about a straight wall with a sharp edge. But there are plenty of mpcs that have a rounded curve back from the window. Of course, the real way to test all this would be to take identical mpcs and create different profiles at the window. Certainly everything, as you say, has an effect to some degree. A partial reflection might well explain why a gradual ramp would react differently than a "wall", but in my understanding, the distribution of the volume, if there are no sudden changes in bore diameter, does not matter. That has been the point all along in my argument.

It seems to me that with appropriate contouring at the back of the window cutout, and perhaps a bit of material added in the chamber at that position to compensate if necessary, it would be entirely possible to get the same effect as cutting down the table, without the possibility of introducing structural instability in the mpc (especially if it is not metal). The fact that the volume is still off-center towards the reed should not matter if there is no abrupt change or edge, which was the point that I have been trying to make.

      C&#39;mon Toby.  Look at a few mouthpieces.  Some have a straight, vertical wall of 2+mm.   Besides, it is well documented that any sudden change in bore diameter causes a change in air column impedance and a partial reflection.

      What evidence do you have that the "wall" (it is more a bulge) creates resistance, if it is not sharp enough to create a reflection or turbulence?

      You are not following very well.  

The wall is the resistance problem.  It is caused by a lopsided volume distribution.  Distribute the volume evenly and there is no wall and no resistance problem.  Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

      This is from the thread about a pulled down neck. It might be useful to add one more part of the quote:

"This is actually the case. Saxophone necks have non-cylindrical cross 
sections where they are bent. Some years ago, I unsoldered all parts 
from an alto neck (Selmer Series II, never pulled down) to measure the 
dimensions:


as an example, the external diameters, as measured top-down versus 
right-left, for one cross-section are 19.5mm diameter and 20.4mm 
diameter. The actual shape of the cross-section is probably not an 
ellipse but some non-circular shape, more or less symmetric, a bit 
egg-shaped or something else, as are most real things, non-ideal.



This does not matter, what matters is the cross-sectional area as a function of the distance along the spine of the instrument. " (my italics)

The "bend" caused by the offset of the volume resulting from a deep window is small, akin to the bend in the neck. It should not matter. If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

      When a neck suffers some degree of "pull down", it is reduced in volume 
to some extent where the bend occurred. This has measurable and 
significant effects.



The shape of the cross-section (circular, elliptical, triangular, squared, ...) do not matter.



The curvature of the neck has negligible effects (contrarily to the curvature of the elbow).

 No. A circular cross section is not acoustically superior to any 
other shape such as ellipsis or even squares, they will behave the same 
if they have the same area.

      Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute for me. By what acoustic principle should the volume be distributed equally around the central axis? You might have noted on SOTW that Antoine Lefebvre mentioned that shape is of no consequence. 



Of course volume as a function of length IS of consequence, which helps to explain the differences between short/fat and long/narrow. 



If there is a perturbation of a nature to cause turbulence or a reflection at that point it is a different matter, but the shape of the volume, within fairly wide limits, doesn&#39;t appear to matter, at least according to the experts.



There is no point in deliberately making an air column relatively bumpy, but the point was that a bumpy air column can function as well as a smooth one. 



John Neptune, one of Japan&#39;s top shak players and makers, let me play his main flute at one workshop. Amazing beast, it was. I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

IMO, having space at the end of the window/in front of a high ramp, on a mouthpiece with a thick table, is a mistake, and rounding/angling the ramp, while reducing the

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

            <pre class='message__body'>MartinMods: "Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall 
creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is 
unacceptable in most cases."

I have found that in my work for clients, this has been acceptable in most 
cases.  The "response" gains from undercutting the base of window "U" 
outweigh the focus losses from making the chamber volume larger.  I have never 
had a client complain that the mouthpiece is not focused enough when they get it 
back.  I think since I make a number of other improvements as part of the rework 
job, the negative effect may get buried.  I do not deny that it is there.  Just 
that it is acceptable in most cases.  If it was not, I would routinely add some 
putty to the chamber to compensate.</pre>

Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

IMO, having space at the end of the window/in front of a high ramp, on a mouthpiece with a thick table, is a mistake, and rounding/angling the ramp, while reducing the

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

I have found that in my work for clients, this has been acceptable in most cases.  The "response" gains from undercutting the base of window "U" outweigh the focus losses from making the chamber volume larger.  I have never had a client complain that the mouthpiece is not focused enough when they get it back.  I think since I make a number of other improvements as part of the rework job, the negative effect may get buried.  I do not deny that it is there.  Just that it is acceptable in most cases.  If it was not, I would routinely add some putty to the chamber to compensate.

As to why, of course, any energy that is reflected is lost to the regime.  It may also inhibit the reed&#39;s ability to feed energy to an air column oscillation - see pp 78 to end:

      Experience is evidence enough.  I see it just about every day.  I&#39;m not really interested in debating whether or not this is real, my observations are enough to convince me and they are consistent with the observations of others who reface mouthpieces. 



What I am interested in is why this happens.

Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

I was totally flabbergasted when I sighted down it and saw that it has the most uneven bore I had ever seen, with scoops and dollops of putty everywhere. He is a master of adjustment, and had been tinkering with it for years, doing large and small local volume adjustments everywhere. That certainly convinced me that Antoine is quite right.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

IMO, having space at the end of the window/in front of a high ramp, on a mouthpiece with a thick table, is a mistake, and rounding/angling the ramp, while reducing the

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

            <pre class='message__body'>There is one mouthpiece design that I have just done the undercutting to: The 
metal Yanagisawa.  The facing curve is usually very good on these (and other 
Yana mouthpieces).  But the square throat area makes for a ~3/32" thick "wall".  
I have undercut 3 of these mouthpieces in the past few years and the resulting 
change was very satisfying.  I think that in this case, the design may have been 
more focussed than needed so it was a win-win in making the mouthpiece more 
free-blowing and a little more spread sounding.

I can only relate my own personal experience/preference here on my own 
mouthpieces.  I While rounding is fine, I have never be satisfied with how a 
mouthpiece played for myself, after completely "leveling" a ramp wall.  Of 
course, I was experiencing the difference immediately, and I wasn&#39;t combining 
the experience with other alterations - a new tip opening, a new facing curve, a 
new baffle, etc..

There is one mouthpiece design that I have just done the undercutting to: The metal Yanagisawa.  The facing curve is usually very good on these (and other Yana mouthpieces).  But the square throat area makes for a ~3/32" thick "wall".  I have undercut 3 of these mouthpieces in the past few years and the resulting change was very satisfying.  I think that in this case, the design may have been more focussed than needed so it was a win-win in making the mouthpiece more free-blowing and a little more spread sounding.

I can only relate my own personal experience/preference here on my own mouthpieces.  I While rounding is fine, I have never be satisfied with how a mouthpiece played for myself, after completely "leveling" a ramp wall.  Of course, I was experiencing the difference immediately, and I wasn&#39;t combining the experience with other alterations - a new tip opening, a new facing curve, a new baffle, etc..

MartinMods: "Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases."
 
I have found that in my work for clients, this has been acceptable in most cases.  The "response" gains from undercutting the base of window "U" outweigh the focus losses from making the chamber volume larger.  I have never had a client complain that the mouthpiece is not focused enough when they get it back.  I think since I make a number of other improvements as part of the rework job, the negative effect may get buried.  I do not deny that it is there.  Just that it is acceptable in most cases.  If it was not, I would routinely add some putty to the chamber to compensate.

Do ask him.  I&#39;d be very interested in his view on this subject, as well as the applicability of Scavone&#39;s two mouthpiece models to the real world, since their cavity resonance frequencies were not matched to that of the missing cone&#39;s, mouthpiece matching, and Rocaboy&#39;s study, just for starters.

      Experience is evidence enough.  I see it just about every day.  I&#39;m not really interested in debating whether or not this is real, my observations are enough to convince me and they are consistent with the observations of others who reface mouthpieces. 



What I am interested in is why this happens.

Trying to eliminate the wall by cutting down an existing wall creates a new, larger chamber that is less centered or unfocused.  This is unacceptable in most cases.  Filling the window in, up to the break, is a good solution, but the volume loss must be made up by removing material elsewhere - the volume then, is more evenly distributed which brings us to the best solution, which is to make the mouthpiece without a lopsided volume distribution in the first place.

If your experience tells you that there is a difference between a deep and shallow ramp--and the volume is really, truly equal--you must look elsewhere for the explanation.

Looking at the shape of the mouthpiece air column, it&#39;s easy to see how every contour and curve could function acoustically - except the lopsided, lump of a window, with an abrupt, thick, ramp wall at the end.  That chamber volume could easily be more effectively distributed around the entire chamber circumference, if needed at that distance from the reed.  This is an example of structural considerations (table wall strength) preempting those acoustical.

As Scavone notes, changes in that area would tend to affect tone color, by influencing the impedances of higher harmonics. Wyman talks a lot about how the ramp angle changes response, and it is not clear why that should be so if we are simply talking about perturbation theory, since in that case only the cross-sectional volume should matter, as the bend in the air column would be insignificant acoustically. I wonder if there is some sort of reflection set up at the end of the window that affects the reed behavior.

We will further assume that the reed channel geometry is determined  by the front reed channel height hr at the tip of the reed."

Clearly, past the break, where the reed never vibrates, the flow has reattached itself to the walls of the mouthpiece, and we can assume that "simple" perturbation theory applies.  My personal experience in manipulating ramp geometry would substantiate this, at least for myself.

We are no longer talking here about simple perturbation theory, but the behavior of the free jet caused by the reed oscillation, and how it separates from the reed channel and interacts with the rest of the air column, as well as many other aero-acoustic parameter. No one seems to have a very good clue for the modeling of what is happening around there.

One of the nicest sounding/playing pieces I ever had (after doing some chamber modifications), was a metal Colletto.  The throat bore entered the chamber at a very low angle, and the table wall was very, very thin at the window, and just thick enough at the shank, to handle the stress of holding the mouthpiece on the cork.  It was balanced, free-blowing, and centered.   A ramp effectively didn&#39;t exist.

IMO, having space at the end of the window/in front of a high ramp, on a mouthpiece with a thick table, is a mistake, and rounding/angling the ramp, while reducing the

I&#39;m not crazy about Ferron&#39;s explanation, seems to be treating the wavefront as if it were perpendicular to the reed, which doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  How much is acoustic, how much is aerodynamic?  Some of it must be from the larger throat, but I don&#39;t think it can be all this.

Do ask him.  I&#39;d be very interested in his view on this subject, as well as the applicability of Scavone&#39;s two mouthpiece models to the real world, since their cavity resonance frequencies were not matched to that of the missing cone&#39;s, mouthpiece matching, and Rocaboy&#39;s study, just for starters.
