            <pre class='message__body'>Our longtime friend and inventor of the legendary Gig Dust and Crud Patch 
line of products Charlie Andrews passed away this morning after a long bout 
with Leukemia. Charlie was still playing gigs (although forced to sit on a 
stool) until a couple of weeks ago, and was a legendary figure on the 
Memphis music scene. He is survived by his wife, Linda, and cards and plants

may be sent to:

511 Lena Street
Sardis, Ms 38666-1931

Charlie was an avid sportsman, a retired music teacher, and a great player. 
He was a constant source of inspiration to me and a source of considerable 
comfort during some of my illnesses. He loved plants, catfish, barbeque, and

people. I&#39;ll miss him greatly, and his loss will be felt by the entire 
saxophone community.

            <pre class='message__body'>I am sorry to hear about Chralie&#39;s passing.  Like many in the saxophone community I found him to be a great resource and the place to purchase fibracells as well his products.

We will keep him in our thoughts.
