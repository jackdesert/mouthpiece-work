            <pre class='message__body'>Can anyone say me perhaps which actual mpc would be a fine choice to approach a master link (like the one from Ben Webster)? My goal is to buy such a mpc and then let reface/rework it. It must be as cheap as possible (can be chinese...)
Thanks !

            <pre class='message__body'>Probably the best choice would be Vintage Goldbeck that you can buy on ebay
if you wait for it and rarely goes over $80. It is spot on same as Master
Link.
Good luck,
