            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve used the fibracell reeds for several years with my beginning 
sax/clarinet students. I&#39;ve learn to use them AFTER they break 
several cane reeds and stop flicking the reed with their tongue. 
They take the focus off reed function for the 1st year and I can 
spend the lesson time teaching rather than fiddling with reeds. My 
beginning students usually break the reed down at the tip as it 
sometimes shred, although peeling is evident on some. A couple of 
months per reed is great and the parents like the idea and willingly 
pay more. The students leave the reed on, loosen the lig and promise 
to clean the mpc once a week. I personally go thru cycles of "use 
them, don&#39;t use them" on my sop/alto/tenor/bari. I like the extra 
edge it gives to the sound and they always work! I forfeit tactile 
response and "feel" as well as a richer core to the sound. On 
recordings, I can&#39;t tell a damn bit of the difference though.
I think the fibracell folks are right in saying the peeling is 
caused by the user. Of course, they wear out but in different ways 
than cane. I will see the backing start to peel on the outside 
edges. For me it starts at the before the reed leaves the mpc. My 
tenor mpc is a SR PRO and the thin rails may contribute to the 
problem. However, the same happens on my RPC bari and Yani sop 
piece. I play them a lot and they wear out. I also leave the reed on 
the mpc but of course loosen the lig to take off the pressure on the 
reed. I like the new formulation but it still ain&#39;t cane. Just some 
thoughts.
