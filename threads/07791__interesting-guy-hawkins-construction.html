            <pre class='message__body'>I just posted two photos of an older Guy Hawkins MP in the Photos Tenor section.  I was repairing it from a tip dink.  Since the table plating was already removed from a previous refacer, it clearly showed that a thin metal plate is inserted in the table starting near the base of the window "U".  This was probably done to keep the metal thin in this area.  It is about 1/16" thick or so.

If you look inside the window from the tip you can also see that at the end of this metal insert the chamber abruptly steps to the shank bore diameter.  I looked at a couple of other Guy Hawkins that are still plated and you can see they are made the same way by looking inside.  I Saw 2 knurled shank tenors and a plain shank alto mouthpiece made this way.  I can not tell how the metal insert is held in place but it is probably soldered or braised.  

Seems like a lot of trouble as compared to other ways to make mouthpieces.  I do not know if these are Babbitt made or not or if Babbitt still makes them this way.

            <pre class='message__body'>IIRC, the mid 60s Wolf Taynes were also made with a similar table insert, perhaps to facilitate some undercutting at the base of the window?

            <pre class='message__body'>One of the obstacles to machining a large chamber moutphiece is getting tooling into the throat. I think what they&#39;ve done with these is first cut the window much too long, then mill out the throat, then solder (or braze) a plate over the hole to make it right again, rather than leave it (ala Rovner or Jody Espina).

            <pre class='message__body'>Saw another interesting piece related to this yesterday.  An old British Selmer.  The body was bored through the whole way and top half of the beak (with tip and floor) was a seperate piece soldered on.
