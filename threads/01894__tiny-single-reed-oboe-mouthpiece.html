            <pre class='message__body'>Anyone see, know of an oboe mouthpiece tiny looks like a mini 
clarinet mouthpiece on a tube.  I have one, found it at a musical 
salvage auction.  I made a reed for it and played it on my oboe.  It 
works sounds a little funky.  But a nice conversation piece.  
Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Runyon used to make one.  I think I&#39;ve seen metal and HR/plastic ones.

            <pre class='message__body'> I use to play oboe and bought one off those  over 30 years ago. I thoulght
it might work for  doubling or when I was out of a good reed.  The thing
never worked right and I gave up on it.  It now lives in the bottom of my
junk drawer.

I got it out to look it over.  It has a nice  chrome ligature and cap as
well as an original reed.  There is writing on the reed: "France" and then
something like "Xaits" but that&#39;s a real guess.  On the mouthpiece it says
"Paris" and then "D. (?)eclonllr" again a guess.  It&#39;s in a nice slide out
box with a  price tag on the end that says"Tang &Dinner Inc" 4753 but no
price. on the other end in blue ink there is "HB" and "no 9".  I have no
idea what that means.

A curoisity piece.  I wonder what it would bring on Ebay?

            <pre class='message__body'>This sounds like the mouthpiece I found.  very nice ligature and cap 
some fancy engraving on it.  I tried it and the sound is very unique.
I have to try making some better reeds for it.  It&#39;s a conversation 
piece for sure.

            <pre class='message__body'>I know of two types-the one you describe which is like a mini-clarinet mpc 
(ebonite) and another made by Linton if memory serves that was simply an 
extended staple made of aluminum shaped somewhat like a mini early Dukoff !  
I have one of those but the  teeny-tiny single screw ligature  broke years 
ago. I may have the remnants in the plastic tube mouthpiece container which  
rests in the back of the "collection" cabinet.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve:  Jack Linton (Linton oboes) made a silver oboe mouthpieces.  I 
first saw these in a store in the mid 1960&#39;s.

Linton was inspired to make the mouthpiece due to the success of Santy 
Runyon&#39;s single reed mouthpiece for bassoon.  The Runyon bassoon 
mouthpiece is still in production, and uses common clarinet reeds.  It 
sounds like a bassoon, you cannot tell the difference.  Perhaps you need 
to experiment with your reed making for the oboe mouthpiece.
