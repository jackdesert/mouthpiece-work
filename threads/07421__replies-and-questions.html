            <pre class='message__body'> it would seem that it is more important for some members to undertake self aggrandizement and make assertions about colleagues than communicate. In view of this i would be grateful if everyone would refrained from contacting me as i have not the slightest intention of replying. those who wish can visit www.antonweinberg.com
