            <pre class='message__body'>After some discussion with two dentists who do reconstructive work (one 
is my brother), I bought some dental acrylic to repair tooth gouges.  I 
just tried it on a plastic junker and it seems to work really well.  
Here are the main points:

- I&#39;m an amateur refacer, and it was quite easy for me to get a smooth 
surface on this (file, sand, fine-cut auto body rubbing compound).  
Those with more expertise with the tools can probably get a nearly 
invisible fix.  It should bond to plastic or hard rubber extremely well.

- because it&#39;s orthodontic resin, it&#39;s completely safe for putting in 
your mouth.  I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s essentially the same as fake nail 
acrylic, but I like the assurance of knowing that this stuff was made to 
be inside the mouth.

- It is a liquid-plus-powder system, applied in alternating layers.  The 
liquid comes in a plastic bottle with a dropper, and the powder comes in 
a nozzle-top bottle (like Charlie A&#39;s gig dust - just a much bigger 
bottle).  Drip on some liquid, blow on some powder, etc.

- nearly infinite shelf life.

- it cures in about 10 minutes

- you&#39;ll need good ventilation - the liquid has a strong chemical fume 
smell.

- the stuff I used is called "Ortho-Jet" (powder and liquid) and is made 
by Lang Dental Mfg. in Wheeling IL (USA).  I bought it through a dental 
supply company called Schein.  I got what is called the Pro kit (or 
something like that), which includes a 118 ml bottle of liquid and a 100 
g bottle of powder.  $32, and it should last forever.

- They sent me the pink liquid instead of clear, but I can&#39;t see any 
color on the patch I made - it all looks black. I think coloring agents 
are available as well.

- nearly infinite shelf life.

I&#39;m sure there are other systems like this, but after talking to 
dentists who use this type of stuff, this looked like it would fit the 
bill really well (easy to use, quick setup, available in small 
quantities, not too expensive).  You don&#39;t have to be a dentist to order 
it.  My dentist was making a large order with Schein anyway, so I saved 
on shipping.

Apparently it&#39;s not that critical.  The instructions say: "Moisten 
surface with liquid.  Then apply powder.  Alternate liquid and powder 
until desired shape and thickness is achieved.  Always begin and end 
with liquid for best results."

            <pre class='message__body'>And a lower price ($28.76).  BTW - with the kit (powder+liquid), get the 
clear rather than the pink...

Do you think it would be practical to make an entire bite plate out 
of this liq/powder stuff?  How long do you think it would it take to 
lay down the needed layers to build up a 3/32" thick plate?  How fast 
does it set up?

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know.  It sets up quickly (10 min), so when a small groove is 
filled in, the acrylic surface left can be pretty uneven.  It sands 
easily, but you wouldn&#39;t want to carve/sand a whole bite plate.  I&#39;m 
sure there&#39;s some other dental acrylic product that can be poured into 
molds or would have better workability. Or perhaps there&#39;s some other 
technique of using this stuff that would make constructing an even bite 
plate more feasible.
