    I can only speak for myself here, as a player and not a mouthpiece guy,
but I have been very impressed with Aizens mouthpieces. I have been on a
quest to find that old Meyer NY/Meyer Brothers sound on alto, and I own one
of their first series Meyer Brothers copies, as well as one of their current
Meyer NY pieces. Both play amazingly well, and the Meyer Brothers piece is
my go-to piece today. I have had mouthpieces made for me by many different
people (Saxscape, Morgan, Mouthpiece Café, Dave Jary), I own a lot of
high-end pieces, and I have had lots of pieces worked on by the likes of
Mojo, Mikole Kaar, Eric Griffenhagen, etc., and I can honestly say that
while they all play really well, only this Aizen piece has truly gotten me
close to the sound that I am looking for and hear in my head. While it might
not be innovative in the sense that there is not a whole lot new, the
execution of design has proven to be the absolute best for me to get to the
sound I am trying to get. Short of spending a ridiculous amount of money on
a vintage Meyer/Meyer Brothers piece (which I just cannot justify), this is
it. At the end of the day, as a player, that is all I really care about.

My records indicate that I have not worked on a Meyer-like alto mouthpiece for you.  I do not know how close I would have gotten to your sound goals if I did.  But I wanted clarify that not all the names you mentioned were in the running.  My records indicate I worked on an alto Guardala Studio for you in 2009.

I think the point you were trying to make was that the Aizens are of high quality and can hang with the best of them.   I have not seen one yet, so I have no opinion of them.

    Yes, I apologize for any confusion that I might have caused. What I meant is that I have had pieces worked on by many of the top guys out there, and they all came back playing great. The quality of this Aizen piece is right up there with them. I didn’t mean to imply that I have had you work on Meyer like pieces to try to get to that sound, my apologies if it came across that way. For the record, you also worked on a tenor Guardala, and alto and tenor Lawtons for me ;-)

Pretty nice quality, nothing innovative that I observed……..that price strikes me as a little strong……..the mouthpieces played well, but were not different from lots of other good quality products that are available for less $$$......... I am a firm believer that for strong money you should offer (1) real innovation; (2) fantastic quality; or both. More of the same old thing leads people to buy Selmer and Yamaha, IMHO. 
 
The products shown were nice, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Aizen Sax
 
  

Ebay is currently offering 10 Aizen saxophones for a not insignificant price of $4,000 a piece, a brand that I am not familiar with.
 http://cgi.ebay. com/ws/eBayISAPI &lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=180461563411>  .dll?ViewItem&item=180461563411 . From going on the net, I found that they apparently have a presence in the mouthpiece market. The ad on Ebay states that it was "a bit hit at the 2010 NAMM  show."  I know Steve Goodson attended this year&#39;s show and I wonder if Steve or for that matter anyone knows anything  about this horn.
