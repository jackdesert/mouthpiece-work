            <pre class='message__body'>Very likely the whole mouthpiece has to be gradually heated up to remove
internal stresses (annealed) before you can do something like this;
otherwise heating the tip will crack it - unless these pieces are annealed
as part of their manufacturing process, which might be the case.

Then it has to be refaced anyway, and, btw, glass dust is a health hazard.

I can&#39;t see this as a cost-effective solution.

To the extent that the area of the chip can be roughened to increase it&#39;s
surface area, that would improve the adhesion of anything used.

I filled a small chip in a Pomarico crystal mouthpiece with epoxy, and
months later, it is still there with no problems at all. I have only played
this mouthpiece a few minutes occsaionally since then, in case that is
relevant, but I wouldn&#39;t think so since playing doesn&#39;t destroy glue on
other mouthpieces thta are played regularly.

            <pre class='message__body'>--- Thank you all for the advice. My feeling was that it was not worth
trying to fix it and overall that is the feedback I got.
    I think the epoxy fix is "working" only because it just hasn&#39;t
been played enough to jar the epoxy loose.
   The  only glass piece I ever owned got chipped and ended up in the
bottom of the repairman&#39;s aquarium as an ornament. He had several of
them down there, with the cork and brass ring removed. He called it
the  Davy Jone&#39;s locker fix.    Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>Just to clarify: I didn&#39;t mean filling with epoxy is a professional 
solution to reapir this. I&#39;ve only tried it as a fix on one of my own 
mouthpieces to see if it works. No problems after a few months, with 
the mouthpiece only played a few minutes every couple of weeks. I 
have no idea how long it would last (if at all) if I played the 
mouthpiece regularly.

In most, but not all of industry.

I do not know if this can be adapted to a mouthpiece repair:

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, I don&#39;t see that a chip on a crystal mouthpiece tip is under any
particular mechanical stress; but it certainly will be wet.

If the chip is very small, it may need to be enlarged and roughened in order
to increase the area of adhesion of an epoxy fix.

It might be effective to grind a small groove connecting with it, using a
very small diamond or carbide dental burr, so that the epoxy fix would be
mechanically locked in place. As is done with dental cavities.

I think that&#39;s what I&#39;d try. Nothing to lose. Only, keep the work area wet
to keep down the glass dust.

If the chip is only to the rail itself, and there is glass above it on the beak, an epoxy fix might work (especially using a dental or marine epoxy
 resistant to moisture). But if there is a chip through the beak as well, I find it doubtful that the epoxy bond will hold for long.

My clarinet teacher told me many years ago that he accidentally dropped a wooden mpc belonging to his father, which was his favorite mouthpiece, and chipped the corner. To his everlasting regret, there was no possible fix, though it was tried many times. Sooner or later the constant hammering by
 the reed would loosen whatever was tried and the fix, like a loose filling, would fall off.

outweigh the pros, in my viewpoint anyway.
    I have a whole bunch of mouthpieces on hand  that I can work on
and probably improve, so I have informed the mouthpieces owner that it
is not worth it and he has already located an aquarium to deepsix it.
  If  anyone out there can really claim that they have made a
sound,permanent and not too time-consuming  repair to a glass
mouthpiece, I would love to hear about it.   Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>I haven&#39;t attempted to repair any mouthpiece just yet, I&#39;m still learning
from all of you here in this group.

 

However, I have a crazy idea - those that are more experienced with this,
please correct me if my idea is bad. there won&#39;t be any hurt feelings. :-)

 

I have a question - just how big is this chip in the mouthpiece?

 

The reason why I ask is, if the chip is large enough. my crazy idea is as
follows.

 

Maybe - just maybe - you could drill one (or more) tiny pin holes into the
mouthpiece; where the break is.. And use some sort of very thin; but very
strong wire. and "pin" the mouthpiece, like you would pin a crack in a
clarinet..

 

The pin(s) could work as an anchor of sorts, which might be enough to give a
suitable epoxy something to work with.. I don&#39;t know - it&#39;s just a crazy
idea..

            <pre class='message__body'>I have, let say "repaired" a lot of cipped crystal mouthpieces simply refacing it completely. After having measured 
 its profile I have reproduced  the same features on the mouthpiece after taking off the cipped part.
I have used it like a blank, on wich I have repeated its original profile.
The diminution of the chamber volume some time increse the sound intensity wich can be an advantage, but if it were not
accepted by the owner it is not a problem to take out some material inside the chamber using proper diamond tools.

The lenght of the window, if it were diminished, will not affect intonation significantly.
In any case you will obtain a result that, if it isnt superior to the original, at least it is more usefull to a musician
then an acquarium decoration.
Best regards.

I haven’t attempted to repair any

However, I have a crazy idea – those

there won’t be any hurt feelings. J

And use some sort of very thin; but very strong wire… and “pin”
