No.  I can&#39;t think of any adhesive that will bond to glass more than 2 
minutes.  You can try, but the frustration will kill you.  Move on to a 
more productive use of your time.

            <pre class='message__body'>Very likely the whole mouthpiece has to be gradually heated up to remove
internal stresses (annealed) before you can do something like this;
otherwise heating the tip will crack it - unless these pieces are annealed
as part of their manufacturing process, which might be the case.

Then it has to be refaced anyway, and, btw, glass dust is a health hazard.

I can&#39;t see this as a cost-effective solution.

To the extent that the area of the chip can be roughened to increase it&#39;s
surface area, that would improve the adhesion of anything used.

months later, it is still there with no problems at all. I have only played
this mouthpiece a few minutes occsaionally since then, in case that is

            <pre class='message__body'>Just to clarify: I didn&#39;t mean filling with epoxy is a professional 
solution to reapir this. I&#39;ve only tried it as a fix on one of my own 
mouthpieces to see if it works. No problems after a few months, with 
the mouthpiece only played a few minutes every couple of weeks. I 
have no idea how long it would last (if at all) if I played the 
mouthpiece regularly.

In most, but not all of industry.

I do not know if this can be adapted to a mouthpiece repair:

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, I don&#39;t see that a chip on a crystal mouthpiece tip is under any
particular mechanical stress; but it certainly will be wet.

If the chip is very small, it may need to be enlarged and roughened in order
to increase the area of adhesion of an epoxy fix.

It might be effective to grind a small groove connecting with it, using a
very small diamond or carbide dental burr, so that the epoxy fix would be
mechanically locked in place. As is done with dental cavities.

I think that&#39;s what I&#39;d try. Nothing to lose. Only, keep the work area wet
to keep down the glass dust.

            <pre class='message__body'>As in dentistry, all depends on the nature of the chip, and whether it is supported against the beating of the reed by the main material of the mpc. If the chip is only to the rail itself, and there is glass above it on the beak, an epoxy fix might work (especially using a dental or marine epoxy
 resistant to moisture). But if there is a chip through the beak as well, I find it doubtful that the epoxy bond will hold for long.

My clarinet teacher told me many years ago that he accidentally dropped a wooden mpc belonging to his father, which was his favorite mouthpiece, and chipped the corner. To his everlasting regret, there was no possible fix, though it was tried many times. Sooner or later the constant hammering by
 the reed would loosen whatever was tried and the fix, like a loose filling, would fall off.

outweigh the pros, in my viewpoint anyway.
    I have a whole bunch of mouthpieces on hand  that I can work on
and probably improve, so I have informed the mouthpieces owner that it
is not worth it and he has already located an aquarium to deepsix it.
  If  anyone out there can really claim that they have made a

            <pre class='message__body'>I haven&#39;t attempted to repair any mouthpiece just yet, I&#39;m still learning
from all of you here in this group.

 

However, I have a crazy idea - those that are more experienced with this,
please correct me if my idea is bad. there won&#39;t be any hurt feelings. :-)

 

I have a question - just how big is this chip in the mouthpiece?

 

The reason why I ask is, if the chip is large enough. my crazy idea is as
follows.

 

Maybe - just maybe - you could drill one (or more) tiny pin holes into the
mouthpiece; where the break is.. And use some sort of very thin; but very
strong wire. and "pin" the mouthpiece, like you would pin a crack in a
clarinet..

 

The pin(s) could work as an anchor of sorts, which might be enough to give a
suitable epoxy something to work with.. I don&#39;t know - it&#39;s just a crazy
idea..

Well so far the arguments against trying to fix the glass mouthpiece
outweigh the pros, in my viewpoint anyway.
I have a whole bunch of mouthpieces on hand that I can work on
and probably improve, so I have informed the mouthpieces owner that it
is not worth it and he has already located an aquarium to deepsix it.
If anyone out there can really claim that they have made a
sound,permanent and not too time-consuming repair to a glass
mouthpiece, I would love to hear about it. Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>I have, let say "repaired" a lot of cipped crystal mouthpieces simply refacing it completely. After having measured 
 its profile I have reproduced  the same features on the mouthpiece after taking off the cipped part.
I have used it like a blank, on wich I have repeated its original profile.
The diminution of the chamber volume some time increse the sound intensity wich can be an advantage, but if it were not
accepted by the owner it is not a problem to take out some material inside the chamber using proper diamond tools.

The lenght of the window, if it were diminished, will not affect intonation significantly.
In any case you will obtain a result that, if it isnt superior to the original, at least it is more usefull to a musician
then an acquarium decoration.
Best regards.

Oggetto: RE: [MouthpieceWork] Re: Chipped crystal mouthpiece


I haven’t attempted to repair any
mouthpiece just yet, I’m still learning from all of you here in this
group.
 
However, I have a crazy idea – those
that are more experienced with this, please correct me if my idea is bad…
there won’t be any hurt feelings. J
 
I have a question – just how big is
this chip in the mouthpiece?
 
The reason why I ask is, if the chip is
large enough… my crazy idea is as follows.
 
Maybe – just maybe – you could
drill one (or more) tiny pin holes into the mouthpiece; where the break is….
And use some sort of very thin; but very strong wire… and “pin”
the mouthpiece, like you would pin a crack in a clarinet….
 
The pin(s) could work as an anchor of
sorts, which might be enough to give a suitable epoxy something to work with….
I don’t know – it’s just a crazy idea….
 
Sincerely,
               Karsten J. Chikuri
