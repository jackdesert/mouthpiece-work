            <pre class='message__body'>I never had the pleasure of visiting with Everett Matson although I did send  a few mouthpieces to him.  Could someone give some insight into his methods?   What kind of tools did he use and techniques.   I understand he used popsicle sticks.  He certainly had some magic in his work.
