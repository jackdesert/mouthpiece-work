  I have an old Link tenor piece. The plating on was so badly damaged, 
  that it was essentially unmeasurable. So I cleaned up the table with 
  600. Starting to look flat now, though there&#39;s still some plating 
  near the butt. I&#39;m definitly down to the brass underneath. There 
  are also some areas delaminating in from the tip, at the baffle that 
  I&#39;d like to clean up

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, it&#39;s my impression (from the Ernst Ferron book) that the brass 
used in saxophones in fact has lead in it.  My recollection is that 
different alloys are used for different components.

The same repairman says you shouldn&#39;t play unlaquered or unplated 
horns if you don&#39;t want to risk picking up heavy metals (and 
subsquent chelation to get rid of it).

I don&#39;t know about mouthpieces.  

The Link I have (and I think this applies to all the non-gold plated 
ones) has some goldish-colored shiny stuff on the outside (seems to 
be plated on, but I guess it could be laquer or something).  When 
that sands off, you get down to "raw brass".

The reason I&#39;m asking is that because of the top layer flaking off, 
the table was definitely not flat; it needed sanding, so I sanded 
it.  

Also there are "bubbles" on the baffle, where the top is going to 
come off.

So what&#39;s on top?  What&#39;s underneath?  Does it contain lead?

Does anyone know?

M.

that even with the added lead, the amount that can be leached through 
oral contact does not present a problem.  I don&#39;t know if the Links

metal pieces, they will likely be gold plated brass.  Thanks, Ken

quite well. I guess that what this means is that you cannot me sure of the
alloy composition of a piece without a proper assay being carried out (or if
possible, by asking the manufacturer). If you cannot be sure of the alloy,
then get it re-plated.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: question about brass mouthpiece toxicity

 

Well, it&#39;s my impression (from the Ernst Ferron book) that the brass 
used in saxophones in fact has lead in it. My recollection is that 
different alloys are used for different components.

The same repairman says you shouldn&#39;t play unlaquered or unplated 
horns if you don&#39;t want to risk picking up heavy metals (and 
subsquent chelation to get rid of it).

I don&#39;t know about mouthpieces. 

The Link I have (and I think this applies to all the non-gold plated 
ones) has some goldish-colored shiny stuff on the outside (seems to 
be plated on, but I guess it could be laquer or something). When 
that sands off, you get down to "raw brass".

The reason I&#39;m asking is that because of the top layer flaking off, 
the table was definitely not flat; it needed sanding, so I sanded 
it. 

Also there are "bubbles" on the baffle, where the top is going to 
come off.

So what&#39;s on top? What&#39;s underneath? Does it contain lead?

Does anyone know?

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not have anything conclusive about lead in the Brasses used or in the
"Silverite" Dukoff uses.  Manufacturers may be required to supply MSDS
sheets on their products in the US.  

Some vintage mouthpiece dealers claim there is lead in certain mouthpieces.
But they have not proved it and they also happen to be selling modern
replicas of those pieces.  I think they are just spreading fear for their
own benefit.

There are brass allergies but it is not a poison.  If you get a tingle in
your lips from playing on bare brass, you will be more comfortable with a
plated or non-brass mouthpiece.  

Some brasses taste worse than others.  After reworking my metal BS Runyon
Quantum I had a lot of exposed brass surfaces.  After a 3-4 hour gig, I had
a brass taste in my mouth I did not like.  I did not notice it on shorter
gigs.  So I brush-plated some Nickel on it and it has been fine ever since.

I have played on bare brass mouthpieces on tenor for long gigs with no
taste problems.

I believe Silverite is a lead-free Pewter.  The new ones tend to have
Nickel plating on the outside while the chamber, table and rails are left
un-plated.  So this appears to be a cosmetic plating, not a health barrier.
 But it does show that Silverite can be plated.  I had heard that Lou
Marini played on a gold-plated Dukoff.  Usually, this reqires layers of
different metals under the gold for a good job.

Recently I heard from someone who called Babbitt that modern Link STMs have
a flash (thin) layer of copper, then silver, then gold.

Jeff Powell, who made the Guardala pieces, confirmed that their brass contained lead, and said that he thinks that almost all brass pieces are made of alloys containing lead.

And yes, lead does definitely leach out of brass; this is why brass plumbing fittings are made with lead-free alloys.

It is not such a problem with bare brass bodies, but it is definitely an issue when there is oral contact with bare brass. Paul says that he has never seen musicians with lead poisoning, but how does he know? The effect is cumulative - why knowingly expose oneself to a known toxin. The neurological damage done by lead is irreversible and it is no fun.

Why take the risk?

 I mean for sure you must have to look at your mpc and give him a plated of gold or silver without nickel, as the jewelry made to protect the skin from allergy.
 With gold you never miss... your wife or your mouthpiece, two loves!
 
 Other dangerous metals are: mercury (not used), alluminium can be accumulated in the brain, zinc (not used) as lead, and nickel very used on old sax manufactury.
 
 What do you think Toby if I plate in gold my Dukoff as Lou Marini? The problem is that my metal mpcs are mostly bare brass, so I have to spend a lot for  jewelry work !!!

 Marini played on a gold-plated Dukoff.  Usually, this reqires layers of
 different metals under the gold for a good job.
 
 Recently I heard from someone who called Babbitt that modern  Link STMs have
 a flash (thin) layer of copper, then silver, then gold.

Lead leaches out of pipes faster when the water is acidic; saliva is
alkaline, hence I think it may not be as active in leaching out the lead, if
at all. Also, how much saliva actually gets sucked back and swallowed, while
playing?

All things considered though, it seems prudent to coat raw brass that&#39;s
going to be in our mouths in some way, whether with inert plating or
lacquer.

Keith mentioned nickel plate. I have no idea what nickel&#39;s ionic mobility is
compared to lead (less, I think); but it&#39;s worth mentioning, again, that
nickel is a strong contact allergen in some people.

Hello Joseph Willis,

Pardonez-moi, mais:

a) Did you read the Previous Posts about some brass having lead added for
improved machining properties?  As it is said: RTFPPP. (The last P is for
"please" as I think we should maintain a level of conviviality here :)

b) I googled for  &lt;"nickel allergy" OR "nickel contact dermatitis">.
78,000 hits.  Here&#39;s the first one:
www.dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/nickel-allergy.html
This features some instructive pictures.

Regards,

Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a customer, that from just holding his trumpet,
he can taste the brass in his mouth.
His horn is bare brass and his mouthpiece is silver
plate.
I had to wrap the area of physical contact to prevent
the brass from entering his system.

Joseph, did you read the whole page regarding Nickel?  I did. You seem to
have omitted some pertinent material:

It says:

  "Information pertaining to particular dangers for man and environment
   R 40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect.
   R 43 May cause sensitization by skin contact."

Further down the page, we see data that (as far as I can tell) appears to
indicate that other countries limit Ni exposure, and regard it as somewhat
of a hazard:

"Components with limit values that require monitoring at the workplace:

Nickel and inorganic compounds, as Ni

at each other... which I like to do too.  Saftey information should 
not be a contest.

This article indicates that about half of all brass in use contains 
lead: 

http://www.copper.org/innovations/1998/07/brass360.html

It also explains that leaded brass can be machined 5X faster than non-
leaded.

What we need are statements from the mouthpiece manufactures as to 
what kind of brass they use.  But they may just take the stand that 
it does not matter since their product is intended to be used with 
plating on it.

Does anyone know if those with Nickel allergies also have problems 
with Chrome plating?  I believe Runyon uses a lot of Chrome plating, 
which may be a better plating than Nickel for the general public.  I 
touched up my mouthpiece using "Copy Chrome" from Caswell, which is a 
Nickel plating made to blend in with Chrome.

I did a few searches and came up with 3.8% max lead, most using 1-2% if
they have lead.  It is pretty easy to get lead-free brass if you can deal
with slower machining speeds (like 10X slower).

The Usual Free Machine Brass is Alloy C360 - 61-1/2% Copper, 3% Lead, 
25.5% Zinc

Naval Brass is Alloy C464 - 60% Copper, no lead, 39-1/4% Zinc and 3/
4% Tin

Naval Brass, Leaded is Alloy C485 - 60% Copper, 1-3/4% Lead, 37-1/2% 
Zinc and 3/4% Tin

The only "High Lead" brass seems to be the Bearing Bronzes - prodycts 
like Alloy C932 (SAE 660) which have 7% Brass.

I can ask to the University of Chemical of Torino, where I have a friend working there, if we can have an analysis of some mpc searching for the components, but sure I will do only if they can make it without destroy my mouthpieces.
 
 Somebody do that before? or we can to know analysis from manufacturer? I think they know exactly what they are using... if it is under controll of Healty Bureaux.

Pretty much all brass has some lead content as you can see below, but 
very little is available to diffuse to the surface where you can 
absorb it...it is pretty well bonded in the bulk.

Fe Max 0.05 
Pb Max 0.15 
Zn 31.3 - 36 

Trace amounts of lead but some (~100 ppm)

but free-machining brass (the most common variety):

 But... watch out to believe what you read on the net !!!
 I would be not so sure all you can read there is the true. When they write is healty I suspect can be not!
 
 Do you remember the story of the medicine Vioxx very famous arround the world. On google they said it was the best result of farmaceutical for pain release and artritis... then it was retired from the market because reconized as source of cancer...

This article is mainly about lead paint, but it is informative. Don&#39;t forget that even leaded glass presents a risk it is not recommended to store potable liquids in leaded glass containers. The risks are well known, why play with fire?

 very little is available to diffuse to the surface where you can 
 absorb it...it is pretty well bonded in the bulk.

Here are a couple of interesting links. The first is a bit tangential, but clearly shows that lead remains unbonded in brass:

http://www.jomesa.de/english/image_analysis/metallography/metallographie_lead_content.htm

And here is an interesting article about lead leaching from plumbing fixtures, and the conditions under which it does:

 The Usual Free Machine Brass is Alloy C360 - 61-1/2% Copper, 3% Lead, 
 25.5% Zinc
 
 Naval Brass is Alloy C464 - 60% Copper, no lead, 39-1/4% Zinc and 3/
 4% Tin
 
 Naval Brass, Leaded is Alloy C485 - 60% Copper, 1-3/4% Lead, 37-1/2% 
 Zinc and 3/4% Tin
 
 The only "High Lead" brass seems to be the Bearing Bronzes - prodycts 
 like Alloy C932 (SAE 660) which have 7% Brass.
