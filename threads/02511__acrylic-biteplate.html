            <pre class='message__body'>I just managed to activate my little webspace with my ISP and post 
pictures of last week&#39;s mouthpiece project.  I made a new bite plate for 
a stainless steel Berg Larsen tenor mouthpiece using 2-part 
quick-setting dental acrylic.  It came out quite well.  I think the 
translucent pink looks great, but there are other colors of acrylic 
available.

Have you tried mixing the powder with the liquid to make a paste/putty out
of it?  If it has a 10 min working time, this might be possible.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been following this discussion in regards to using dental acrylic for repairs and reconstruction of mouthpieces since it started.  As a dentist who has used the stuff for this purpose for over 20 years, I could have jumped in but you guys were carrying the load pretty well.  I have found the material is easy to work with, works well and lasts.  I repaired big chip in a Brilhart Tonalin mouthpiece that came with a Boosey and Hawks "Fogware" alto sax that I purchased used -- the first reed instrument I had (I&#39;ve been a string player, primarily bass, for over 40 years).  The music shop guy said it was a good mouthpiece and worth the trouble.  I still have it and the original repair has hung in there.  I&#39;ve used it with a number of other  materials and found that, of course, it works best with acrylic plastics but can be used with hard rubber as well.  Using acrylic with non acrylic materials requires mechanical retention because there is no true "bond" between the materials.

In regards to mixing up to a paste or putty-like consistency, dental lab technicians, when repairing acrylic appliances, often "freehand" a batch (that is, mix to a desired consistency rather than following the suggested monomer/powder ratio) in a baggie, cut a corner off the bag and squeeze the dough like paste out onto their work -- kind of like a chef filling cream pastries.  The primary problem you run into when improvising with the powder/liquid ratio is getting too much monomer (make the mixture really runny).  It may cure with voids as the unreacted monomer vaporizes within the curing acrylic.  These can be filled, but that adds another step to the process.  Voids are usually only a problem when your are heat curing the acrylic, which is the standard technique in dental labs.  The setting material is placed in a water bath at 120 degrees under 20psi (can be done at home using a pressure cooker) for 10 to 12 minutes.

As far as being tough on the skin, well, as with any solvent it would be prudent to minimize contact of methyl methacrylate monomer with the skin.  However, dental laboratory technicians and dentists have been using it on a daily basis with little or no problems -- at least that I know of.  OSHA is more concerned with inhalation of the vapor that skin contact.

Now, if you REALLY want to try a nice material, try some of the light cured composite resin (resin filled with microscopic quartz particles).  It has great handling properties, indefinite working time and is terrifically hard.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not cheap, comes only is "tooth color" shades and requires a quartz lamp to cure it.  But it is nice.+

Thanks for the info. 

Do you think I should try to pry the new biteplate off of the stainless 
steel and contact-cement it in instead, or just leave it alone if it 
seems solid?

Have you used acrylic to repair chips and other damage around the edges 
of the mouthpiece? Is it sturdy enough when it gets thin (like at the 
tip)?   I have only used it to fill in tooth gouges or to make a biteplate.

            <pre class='message__body'>Paul,

The light cured composite resin is indeed the stuff  your dentist cures 
with a blue laser -- but you don&#39;t need a laser to cure it.  Actually 
room light will cure the resin but it takes a long time.  Curing time is 
directly proportional to intensity of the source.  The light source most 
commonly used is a quartz bulb.  In the dental office, because the light 
is so tightly focused, using protective shield is recommended.
Of course, they make units specifically for curing resin -- they start 
about $200 but any intense full spectrum light will work.  Different 
initiators -- the chemical compounds added to facilitate the cure of the 
resin -- are sensitive to different bands of the spectrum.  Most seem to 
prefer the "high frequency" end hence the "blue laser"

Although the material would be very good for the purpose of restoring 
mouthpieces, I was really just joking about it because the cost would be 
prohibitive.  The material is expensive, the curing light is expensive 
and the finishing and polishing material is expensive.  But if you 
happened to already have the stuff...

Dan,

If your repair seems solid, I&#39;d leave it alone.  Dentist and labs use a 
technique known as "microetching" to provide mechanical retention for 
resins.  This amounts to either a mini sand blaster or acid bath.  Both 
provide an extremely fine "patina-like" finish but it is enough for the 
resin to "grab".  My point is, the stuff can get ahold of very little 
and be fine.  Having typed that, more retention is usually better.  The 
contact cement provides an "adhesion", but it is not a true bond.  
Adhesion and chemical bond are physically different joints.  Adhesion 
generally works best when you have a gloss finished surface like 
polished stainless steel.  None the less, adhesion  generally has less 
strength than chemical bonding.

In regards to chips and tip damage, that is where the resin material 
works best, in my opinion.  The orthodontic acrylic that most of you 
seem to be using is very strong even when thin.  However, this is an 
area where some mechanical retention is a good idea.  I suggest 
preparing some fine grooves or undercuts in the base of the defect for 
the repair material to "lock" into.  The folks at Schein dental can hook 
you up with some dental laboratory burs that will work in a Dremel or 
similar tool.  A 1/2 round or #33 inverted cone shape are ideal for 
this.  Again the light cured resin is better when thin but then, the 
start up cost would be prohibitive for most folks.  On the other hand, 
if you have a good friend who is a dentist, maybe...

Thanks for the info.
Do you think I should try to pry the new biteplate off of the stainless 
steel and contact-cement it in instead, or just leave it alone if it 
seems solid?

Have you used acrylic to repair chips and other damage around the edges

            <pre class='message__body'>Acrylics are OK. Almost all epoxies, including dental ones, seem to contain Bisphenol A, from what I have read. There is controversy over whether they are safe. Industry says that the minute exposures in dental applications do not have any adverse effects and quote studies and research that seems to support that view. Critics say that the studies do not take all factors into account. I&#39;ll try to dig up some links if you are interested.
