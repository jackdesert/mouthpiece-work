            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Meyer Bros. New York tenor mouthpiece. Is there anyone that 
can help me find out about what the original specs should be. I am 
interested in knowing the tip opening and facing curve. It&#39;s an 
amazingly powerful piece. Not as dark as alot I&#39;ve played with alot of 
punch. Any help would be great.

Thank you.!
