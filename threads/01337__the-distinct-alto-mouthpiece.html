            <pre class='message__body'>An interesting idea you have...
My suggestion - get a cheap Meyer or Rico MP somewhere and send it to
Mojo. Tell him you will be using Tenor reeds and the make and strength
of those reeds. Then tell him the EXACT sound you are striving for. I
bet he can cook it up - quite a challenge I think. 
I think if you start with a tenor reed, that is a good start. Large
chamber, with less baffle, but if you start making the MP much more
open you may run into intonation problems...
You can also make some changes inside you airstream - lower your
tongue and open throat like going for a "legit" alto sound. It tends
to darken things...
Good luck!

            <pre class='message__body'>I think the key to geting a more tenor sound on alto is going to wide tips
and softer reeds.  Baffle or not is a secondary consideration.  An open
Jumbo Java (A55 or larger) would be worth checking out.  These are .095+
tips.  Even a .090 starts getting the sound.   Now... the next problem will
be intonation control.

Using a tenor reed is not neccessary, but you may want to try it.

            <pre class='message__body'>A tenor mouthpiece with a tenor reed on an alto will give a throaty sound to an alto, similar to a tenor sax. When I was in high school, I used this combination in marching band during football games. The projection was pretty good. (I got the idea after seeing Edgar Winter in concert).
 
The intonation was a different matter, though. It drove the band director crazy. I could get reasonably in tune by shoving the mpc as far as it would go onto the neck. 
 
I&#39;m wondering if putting a long, high baffle in the  mouthpiece might help the tuning.
 
Hmmm...

            <pre class='message__body'>Try a Ralph Morgan, large chamber, or an RPC (Ron Coelho).
Ron will work with you to give you what you are looking for.

You can buy Morgans at www.junkdude.com.
Ron&#39;s web site is: www.saxmpc.com
