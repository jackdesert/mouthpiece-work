I think these would be easy to get in large quantities.  However, reed tip
shapes do vary.  But it would be a simple matter for a user to do the final
shaping of the tip with a file.  Some reeds, like Vandoren bari reeds, are
wider than "the norm".

            <pre class='message__body'>My kit was inherited from Dave Edwards, formerly the lead chair in 
the Lawrence Welk orchestra. Included is a 1/16" thick aluminum 
tenor "reed" for tip, lay and table shaping.  It is a great tool. It 
would be better to have something flexible to bend with the facing 
curve. I expect that these could be machined or stamped easily enough 
but that would be time consuming. Something like 1/24" or 1/32" 
accurately sized stainless steel would be flexible and somewhat 
permanant and most welcomed in all 4 standard saxophone reed sizes.

This is the thickness of a Runyon Spoiler reed.  I have a roll of it in SS.
 Maybe I&#39;ll try making one.

If you get like 100+, there are Laser cutting fab options.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Runyon "Reed Burner" is a flat aluminum template with shapes for alto, tenor, baritone saxes and clarinet.  Sorry, no soprano.  
   
  http://www.runyonproducts.com/reed.burner.html
  
It is used to trim reeds with a flame in the same way players used to use a coin and cigarette lighter.
   
  You would have to saw it into four pieces, but this would be easy to do with a bandsaw or fiber cutoff wheel on a dremel tool.

I can get SATB sets of ~1 mm thick 304 SS reed shapes for $20/set.  I 
would need to get 30 sets made for this price.  If there is interest 
from 20 people, I&#39;ll consider doing this.  It would take about 6 weeks.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d take one set too.

But I have a question or two. 

For my purposes, shaping the tip of the reed is crucial.   Also the 
width of the reed.

Is the general plan to have the end user file the tip to match the 
mouthpiece?  Same thing with the width?

Can I get 4 tenors?  2 tenors, 2 altos?

Praise the Lord, I play neither bari nor soprano.

The tip would be easy to shape yourself.  The width is a bigger problem. 
Being stainless steel, it would be a hassle to everyone if I had all the
widths made oversized.  You can consider shaping down a bari size?

The way I came up with a price was by laying out 4 approximate reed sizes
and getting a quote for cutting out sets of all 4 from a shop that does
laser cutting.  I would need to do this more precisely before placing an
order.  

Adding a couple more reeds, like a clarinet and bass clarinet, or 2 more
tenors, would add $1.50 to each set.  But each set would have those extra reeds.
