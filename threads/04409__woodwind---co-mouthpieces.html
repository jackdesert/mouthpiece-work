Greetings Group!

Thanks to everyone for you lively discussion on my post for flattening
the table.  I got the straight edge that Brad Behn recommended and it
works great (cheap too!).  And thanks to Paul Coats for emailing me the
refacing resources - invaluable!

Today I&#39;m posting to see if anyone out there in the group knows anything
about vintage Woodwind & Co mouthpieces.  I play a WW&Co Sparkle-Aire on
tenor.  It has been refaced to a link 8 (.110) by Adam Niewood
(www.niewood.com &lt;http://www.niewood.com> ) and it plays great.  It has
a very large chamber and scooped out side walls.  It gets a dark, gruff
sound with a tiny bit of edge when pushed - kind of like Chris Potter
when he plays HR mpcs.  Anyway, I&#39;ve never found anyone (and I mean
anyone) who knows anything about these pieces.  I know they made
mouthpieces in the 30&#39;s-40&#39;s in NY (the WW stell ebonite and melliphone
special series) and at some point were in Paris and ended up (like
everyone else) in Elkhart or maybe Wisconsin.  Then the company was
bought out by Leblanc (who was then recently bought by Selmer) and the
WW&co mpcs are not what they once were.  I haven&#39;t found any info on
where and when the Sparkle-Aires were made, however.  I have one for
alto too tht I haven&#39;t had refaced yet, but it&#39;ll have to wait for now
because it&#39;s got to go from about a .061 to a .076 (meyer 6).  I&#39;ve been
trying to get ahold of Adam to do this one too but I think he&#39;s on the
road right now.



Anyway - does anyone have any additional information or any comments
about WW&Co in general?



thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Don&#39;t know much about the company - but I&#39;ve got a
Woodwind Co bari piece marked B3 (I think) that is
huge and has scooped out sidewalls and an excavated
chamber.  Dark dark sound - really nice..  Plays
better on a large bore horn though otherwise you need
to push it on almost as far as it will go.

I also have what I think is a newer Sparkle Aire bari
piece that plays pretty well - but not as nice as the
WW Co.
