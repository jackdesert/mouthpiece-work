I recommend Bradford Behn.  He refaced a LeLandias for me and it plays

Lee Livengood is also great, but I don&#39;t know how much refacing work he&#39;s 
doing right now.

Both my own and my partner&#39;s Kaspars were reface by Brad or Lee.  One did 
mine and the other did his.  But I can&#39;t remember which.
Brad refaced a crystal Lelandais and a wood Buffet mouthpiece of mine a year 
or so ago..

I picked up a Lelandais on auction a few weeks back. I would like to
have it refaced. Who would you recommend I send it too?

Thanks
