            <pre class='message__body'>RC,
 
I recommend Bradford Behn.  He refaced a LeLandias for me and it plays  
beautifully.  Really nice job.  He charges $85.00 but that includes  shipping.  
Write to him at:

            <pre class='message__body'>Brad Behn is the man.
Lee Livengood is also great, but I don&#39;t know how much refacing work he&#39;s 
doing right now.

Both my own and my partner&#39;s Kaspars were reface by Brad or Lee.  One did 
mine and the other did his.  But I can&#39;t remember which.
Brad refaced a crystal Lelandais and a wood Buffet mouthpiece of mine a year 
or so ago..

I picked up a Lelandais on auction a few weeks back. I would like to
have it refaced. Who would you recommend I send it too?

Thanks
