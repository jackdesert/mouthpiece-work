An excellent video with good audio commentary.
The only point I was unclear about, was the sanding of the inner rail edges. 
I have always left them sharp, in the belief that rounding them, may in some way, do something adverse to the response.
Rounding of the inner tip rail edge being another instance, though this may be of much more significance. 
Some clarification is needed I think.
Eddie.

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not think this is an important area to be concerned with.  I generally 
"break" all sharp edges which is a machinists term for lightly chamfering or 
rounding them so you do not cut yourself.  Usually not a problem except on metal

I have seen a few heavily rounded side rails, which I think were experiments 
gone wrong.  


You can make a few mouthpieces with sharp and rounded rails and get a few 
players to try them blind.

Thank you Keith for your comments. I had not considered the danger of sharp metal edges. A rounding is also more pleasant to the eye.

You are doing a great service for those of us who work on their own mouthpieces, but are not professional mouthpiece refacers.  I find it very satisfying that my instincts (and the Eric Brand manual!) have led me to use the same techniques that you employ in this video, letting me know I am on the right track. 

Thanks again,

            <pre class='message__body'>Just as there is no single best mouthpiece for everyone, there is no single best 
kit or vendor for refacing gages and tools.  The Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site has 
files and links for suppliers.

For tip openings, I use a machinist&#39;s depth gage with a 6" long base.  The 6" 
base is not easy to find new or used.  4" is not long enough.  There base that 
is like the 6" base but with one end cut off called a half base.  But these are 
hard to find in 3-3.5" lengths.  


I have also use a Fowler dial tip gage and a similar gage LAW made for me with a 
pointed tip probe.  I have also used digital inside calipers along with the back 
of a glass gage held against the table to measure tip openings.  It is a bit 
tricky but can be done.

As I have previously said, I prefer Babbitt and LAW glass gages.  I have not 
seen the Wanne gages up close but I would expect them to be good too.  


Mitchell Store has the most complete set of feelers out there now.  His tip gage 
might be OK.  I purchased a base similar to the one he uses and I did not care 
for the shape of its table contact surface.  It has two parallel rails on it.  
If he machines this flat before selling it, it would be good.  


Digital micrometers (or at least calipers) are good for checking the quality of 
your feeler gages.  Measure them in several spots along the edge you will be 
using to find out their actual size and if they are tapered at all.  I measure 
mine to the nearest .0001" several time and average the result.  I then use 
this number in my spreadsheet.  It is a bit "anal" but it does not hurt anything 
and in some cases may help.  I have one gage that high and the next one was low 
by ~.0005" which was a significant .001" gap change IMO.

            <pre class='message__body'>  The Music Medic tip gauge works pretty well for a "budget" minded 
shop.  Very simple to use, and when I got mine, I did a quick accuracy 
check with "known" tip openings on pieces that had just been re-faced by 
Paul Coates.  It was right on the money!

Just as there is no single best mouthpiece for everyone, there is no single best 
kit or vendor for refacing gages and tools.  The Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site has 
files and links for suppliers.
 
For tip openings, I use a machinist&#39;s depth gage with a 6" long base.  The 6" 
base is not easy to find new or used.  4" is not long enough.  There base that 
is like the 6" base but with one end cut off called a half base.  But these are 
hard to find in 3-3.5" lengths.  

 
I have also use a Fowler dial tip gage and a similar gage LAW made for me with a 
pointed tip probe.  I have also used digital inside calipers along with the back 
of a glass gage held against the table to measure tip openings.  It is a bit 
tricky but can be done.
 
As I have previously said, I prefer Babbitt and LAW glass gages.  I have not 
seen the Wanne gages up close but I would expect them to be good too.  

 
Mitchell Store has the most complete set of feelers out there now.  His tip gage 
might be OK.  I purchased a base similar to the one he uses and I did not care 
for the shape of its table contact surface.  It has two parallel rails on it.  
If he machines this flat before selling it, it would be good.  

 
Digital micrometers (or at least calipers) are good for checking the quality of 
your feeler gages.  Measure them in several spots along the edge you will be 
using to find out their actual size and if they are tapered at all.  I measure 
mine to the nearest .0001" several time and average the result.  I then use 
this number in my spreadsheet.  It is a bit "anal" but it does not hurt anything 
and in some cases may help.  I have one gage that high and the next one was low 
by ~.0005" which was a significant .001" gap change IMO.

Hi Keith,
i&#39;d like to buy a complete mouthpiece measuring kit (feeler, tip opening and 
glass gauges).
Do you have any suggestions?
Thanks a lot

Just as there is no single best mouthpiece for everyone, there is no single best 
kit or vendor for refacing gages and tools.  The Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site has 
files and links for suppliers.

For tip openings, I use a machinist&#39;s depth gage with a 6" long base.  The 6" 
base is not easy to find new or used.  4" is not long enough.  There base that 
is like the 6" base but with one end cut off called a half base.  But these are 
hard to find in 3-3.5" lengths.  


I have also use a Fowler dial tip gage and a similar gage LAW made for me with a 
pointed tip probe.  I have also used digital inside calipers along with the back 
of a glass gage held against the table to measure tip openings.  It is a bit 
tricky but can be done.

As I have previously said, I prefer Babbitt and LAW glass gages.  I have not 
seen the Wanne gages up close but I would expect them to be good too.  


Mitchell Store has the most complete set of feelers out there now.  His tip gage 
might be OK.  I purchased a base similar to the one he uses and I did not care 
for the shape of its table contact surface.  It has two parallel rails on it.  
If he machines this flat before selling it, it would be good.  


Digital micrometers (or at least calipers) are good for checking the quality of 
your feeler gages.  Measure them in several spots along the edge you will be 
using to find out their actual size and if they are tapered at all.  I measure 
mine to the nearest .0001" several time and average the result.  I then use 
this number in my spreadsheet.  It is a bit "anal" but it does not hurt anything 
and in some cases may help.  I have one gage that high and the next one was low 
by ~.0005" which was a significant .001" gap change IMO.

Hi Keith,
i&#39;d like to buy a complete mouthpiece measuring kit (feeler, tip opening and

Do you have any suggestions?
