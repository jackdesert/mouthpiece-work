Hi all
Does anyone else have problems downloading from the files section...?

In particular the methods section has two files on facing curves.
The icons are similar to the ones used in "word", but with a
green cross on them.

Each time I try to download, the program says that it&#39;s transferring 
files, and then locks up.....

Anyone else have the same problem....or suggestions...?

This is the only site where this occurs....

            <pre class='message__body'>Those are Excel files.  That is a spreadsheet file. 

I was able to download and open the files easily.  Sounds like it is a 
browser problem for you.

If you don&#39;t have Microsoft Office, which contains Word (word 
processor),Excell (spreadsheet), etc, let me suggest a program will will 
open and work with these Office programs, and more, Easy Office.  Easy 
Word, and Easy Spreadsheet are just a small part of this two disk set.  
Easy office is full office suite.  You are licensed for installation on 
3 computers for only $44.00 USD.

            <pre class='message__body'>Most of the Excel files should be saved in an older Excel format (like "95"
or "97") so they will work with other programs that can read Excel files. 
I may have missed doing this on some newer files there.

If you can read some Excel files and not the others, let me know and I will
check them out.

            <pre class='message__body'>Excell often gets screwed up, I have had this problem on ALL of my 
computers, and no amount of uninstall, reinstall will fix the problem.  
Word will continue to work.  I finally gave up and removed ALL MS Office 
from one of my computers, and installed Easy Office.  I removed all but 
Word on my main home computer and installed Easy Office there, too, but 
still use MS Word for doc files.

There are also known problems with Excell and Netscape.

Can you open and work Excell files on your machine?

      Ross, I tried to send the files to you directly as an email attachment.  It bounced.

      Do you have another address I can try?

          Those are Excel files.  That is a spreadsheet file.  

          I was able to download and open the files easily.  Sounds like it is a browser problem for you.

          If you don&#39;t have Microsoft Office, which contains Word (word processor),Excell (spreadsheet), etc, let me suggest a program will will open and work with these Office programs, and more, Easy Office.  Easy Word, and Easy Spreadsheet are just a small part of this two disk set.  Easy office is full office suite.  You are licensed for installation on 3 computers for only $44.00 USD.
