Hi all
Does anyone else have problems downloading from the files section...?

In particular the methods section has two files on facing curves.
The icons are similar to the ones used in "word", but with a
green cross on them.

Each time I try to download, the program says that it&#39;s transferring 
files, and then locks up.....

Anyone else have the same problem....or suggestions...?

This is the only site where this occurs....

I was able to download and open the files easily.  Sounds like it is a 
browser problem for you.

If you don&#39;t have Microsoft Office, which contains Word (word 
processor),Excell (spreadsheet), etc, let me suggest a program will will 
open and work with these Office programs, and more, Easy Office.  Easy 
Word, and Easy Spreadsheet are just a small part of this two disk set.  
Easy office is full office suite.  You are licensed for installation on 
3 computers for only $44.00 USD.

I may have missed doing this on some newer files there.

If you can read some Excel files and not the others, let me know and I will
check them out.

  Those are Excel files.  That is a spreadsheet file.  

  I was able to download and open the files easily.  Sounds like it is a browser problem for you.

  If you don&#39;t have Microsoft Office, which contains Word (word processor),Excell (spreadsheet), etc, let me suggest a program will will open and work with these Office programs, and more, Easy Office.

Word on my main home computer and installed Easy Office there, too, but 
still use MS Word for doc files.

There are also known problems with Excell and Netscape.

Can you open and work Excell files on your machine?

  Ross, I tried to send the files to you directly as an email attachment.  It bounced.

  Do you have another address I can try?

    There are other files there, that have the Word icon, but without the green cross,  (xls).....it locks up on those too....?
    It too says "transferring files", but then stops responding.

    I&#39;ve been trying to trick one of the family computer geeks over for a visit, but no luck yet....:)

      Those are Excel files.  That is a spreadsheet file.  

      I was able to download and open the files easily.  Sounds like it is a browser problem for you.

      If you don&#39;t have Microsoft Office, which contains Word (word processor),Excell (spreadsheet), etc, let me suggest a program will will open and work with these Office programs, and more, Easy Office.  Easy Word, and Easy Spreadsheet are just a small part of this two disk set.  Easy office is full office suite.  You are licensed for installation on 3 computers for only $44.00 USD.

        In particular the methods section has two files on facing curves.

      Ross, I tried to send the files to you directly as an email attachment.  It bounced.

      Do you have another address I can try?

        Thanks Paul, but I have Word and Excell programs already on this machine....

        It opens the Word documents properly, but locks up on Excell....
        There are other files there, that have the Word icon, but without the green cross,  (xls).....it locks up on those too....?
        It too says "transferring files", but then stops responding.

        I&#39;ve been trying to trick one of the family computer geeks over for a visit, but no luck yet....:)

          Those are Excel files.  That is a spreadsheet file.  

          I was able to download and open the files easily.  Sounds like it is a browser problem for you.

          If you don&#39;t have Microsoft Office, which contains Word (word processor),Excell (spreadsheet), etc, let me suggest a program will will open and work with these Office programs, and more, Easy Office.  Easy Word, and Easy Spreadsheet are just a small part of this two disk set.  Easy office is full office suite.  You are licensed for installation on 3 computers for only $44.00 USD.

            Hi all
            Does anyone else have problems downloading from the files section...?

            In particular the methods section has two files on facing curves.
            The icons are similar to the ones used in "word", but with a
            green cross on them.

            Each time I try to download, the program says that it&#39;s transferring 
            files, and then locks up.....

            Anyone else have the same problem....or suggestions...?

            This is the only site where this occurs....
