            <pre class='message__body'>Good day again everyone.
 

 

 I just want to clarify something when it comes to measuring facing curves. I hope you can help me again
 

 

 I read the guide posted here on how to/steps on measuring facing curves. 
 

 

 I'm just a little confused as to measuring crooked facing curves. 
 

 I followed the steps especially measuring the facing curves and I found out that the table of the mouthpieces that I measured is not flat (most of them are concave)
 

 Do I need to still measure facing curves for the sake of reference even if the table is concave or do I need to flatten the table first to get an accurate measurement? 
 

 

 Thank you
