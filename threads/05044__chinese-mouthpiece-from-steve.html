            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Steve,

the factory you mentioned has the perfect copy of famous branch
mouthpieces is based in Taiwan, and managed by two french guys make
nice saxophone too (best chinese I never seen and played ones) ???
I was living before 2000 for 10 years in Orient and I know Taiwan
productions as better than chinese, or sure I never try nothing good
coming from China perhaps if from the ex-British Hong Kong.
Steve please can you share address of this factory with me? or even
better a phone number (or email) I&#39;m going there on July... I have
still a resort there in Philippines and I&#39;m going for business in
Taipei too. I would like to visit them if they are in Taiwan.

Thanks. Gian
