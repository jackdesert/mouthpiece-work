            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Steve,

the factory you mentioned has the perfect copy of famous branch
mouthpieces is based in Taiwan, and managed by two french guys make
nice saxophone too (best chinese I never seen and played ones) ???
I was living before 2000 for 10 years in Orient and I know Taiwan
productions as better than chinese, or sure I never try nothing good
coming from China perhaps if from the ex-British Hong Kong.
Steve please can you share address of this factory with me? or even
better a phone number (or email) I&#39;m going there on July... I have
still a resort there in Philippines and I&#39;m going for business in
Taipei too. I would like to visit them if they are in Taiwan.

Thanks. Gian

Hi Steve,

the factory you mentioned has the perfect copy of famous branch
mouthpieces is based in Taiwan, and managed by two french guys make
nice saxophone too (best chinese I never seen and played ones) ???
I was living before 2000 for 10 years in Orient and I know Taiwan
productions as better than chinese, or sure I never try nothing good
coming from China perhaps if from the ex-British Hong Kong.
