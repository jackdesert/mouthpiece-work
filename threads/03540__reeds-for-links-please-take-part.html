            <pre class='message__body'>Gentlemen:

I am conducting a slightly informative survey.  I use three different 
Florida Link Tenors pieces, a 7 rubber, (actually measures) a .105, 
with about a 50 for the bottom meaurement with a mOrgan guage, and 2 
metals, an 8 that is actually about 105, and 8* at a 108.  When playing 
a long gig, like a society band or a soft group I find it tough to 
control the low register, and my chops are not really tired because I 
am fairly in shape.  I have been experimenting with Vandoren 2 1/2&#39;s 
without a lot of success, La Voz medium hard, and Rico and Rico 
Royal.   3 1/2.  

If any of you all play this kind of tip opening, what kind of reed 
works for you?

Thanks in advance,

BK

Vandoren Traditional (blue box) are cut for long facings with very 
narrow tip openings.  They work fine with Caravans, LT&#39;s, Raschers, but 
not at all well with most jazz/rock/contemporary mouthpieces (the kind 
you can actually earn money playing).

If you want to play a Vandoren product, try the Java (green box) or V16.

            <pre class='message__body'>On my Tenney blueprinted Tone Edge 7 (looks and feels like .100"), I
use Rico Jazz Select unfiled 3M, and I sand them a bit.  They get a
great sound, and I can play comfortably for quite a while, with
excellent control throughout the range.  Since your mouthpieces are
slightly more open than mine, I imagine a RJS 3S ought to work quite
nicely.

> Hi:
I like the V16s.  I was trying to blow a 3 1/2.  May
go down to the a 3.  I play a lot of classical, so I
think I am focusing the air/embrochure in a more
traditional way, which seems to mean I can use a
smaller tip opening/ reed comination.  It seems when I
am out of shape, I can play a really big tip, with
still a hard reed,  I guess anything that emits a
sound.

Also, I have found the Bari Medium synthetic seems to
work with my slant sig, but not the metals.

Thanks a bunch,

BK
