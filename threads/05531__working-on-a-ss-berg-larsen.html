I&#39;m trying to make some adjustments to a SS Berg Larsen. The main
problem is the facing length is too big, even bigger than the window
length. What can I do to solve it? I was thinking about grinding the
table over a flat surface until the facing length get shorter but I&#39;d
take a lot of time due the material.

Your help will be greatly appreciate.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi

I&#39;m looking for a mouthpiece that is configured and that plays as closely as
possible to the old Selmer alto Soloist C* (I have one circa 1956), but
would like the same thing with a wider facing, maybe C** or D.

I realize that Selmer has ostensibly re-issued the Soloist C*; but only in
the C* facing.

Yes, I could reface it. But wouldn&#39;t mind having a backup in any case. Or an
inexpensive student piece with similar chamber and baffle to use as a blank
as a starting point.

What alto mouthpiece is most like this Selmer piece?

Thanks

Barry

Some people like the Vandoren, though it is a round
chamber, and the Rousseau pieces have a closer chamber
style to the old Selmers.
