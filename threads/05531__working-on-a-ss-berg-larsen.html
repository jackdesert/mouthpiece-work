            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I&#39;m trying to make some adjustments to a SS Berg Larsen. The main
problem is the facing length is too big, even bigger than the window
length. What can I do to solve it? I was thinking about grinding the
table over a flat surface until the facing length get shorter but I&#39;d
take a lot of time due the material.

Your help will be greatly appreciate.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------See message 4923 below. I just bought one of these and started using it to
flatten the tables of metal mouthpieces. I like it a lot. The coarse side is
just a little coarser than the mylar-backed abrasive that Keith recommended
(45 microns for the diamond plate vs. 40 for the mylar sheets).

Cuts stainless steel like nobody's business and leaves it dead flat.

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t work on Berg Larsens.  My local supply stores don&#39;t have enough silicon carbide paper, nor do I have enough time left in my life to remove any meaningful amount of material.
   
  That is some hard stuff!

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi

I&#39;m looking for a mouthpiece that is configured and that plays as closely as
possible to the old Selmer alto Soloist C* (I have one circa 1956), but
would like the same thing with a wider facing, maybe C** or D.

I realize that Selmer has ostensibly re-issued the Soloist C*; but only in
the C* facing.

Yes, I could reface it. But wouldn&#39;t mind having a backup in any case. Or an
inexpensive student piece with similar chamber and baffle to use as a blank
as a starting point.

What alto mouthpiece is most like this Selmer piece?

Thanks

Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m pretty sure the C** facing is available also.  And possibly others.

Some people like the Vandoren, though it is a round
chamber, and the Rousseau pieces have a closer chamber
style to the old Selmers.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would look for a scroll shank from the 70&#39;s.  Some people refer to
the as the long shank soloist.  They&#39;re still reasonable to find. 
Another option would be to try the Rousseau pieces.  Maybe the R5. 
Bamber at one time had out a piece that seemed to be copied from a
Soloist but I haven&#39;t seen those in some time.

All the best,
