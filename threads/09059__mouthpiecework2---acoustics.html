            <pre class='message__body'>I have created a spin-off group at:

Please take a look.  If there are any suggestions let me know.

I will still allow some acoustic discussion to be mentioned here.  But I will try to steer a majority of it to this sister group.  To keep the information flowing as before, just join both groups and post in the appropriate one.  You can also customize how you get the posts sent to you from each forum.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think this is a good solution.  Thanks Kieth.  I&#39;ll wait for John&#39;s summation before I post further.
