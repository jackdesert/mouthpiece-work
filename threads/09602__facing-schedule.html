            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I recently joined the mouthpiece refacing group. I&#39;m a working sax player in 
Sweden and I&#39;ve just for fun started to alter 

some pieces a bit to see the effects.

I wonder where I can find schedules for tenor facings, mainly curves that work 
with Otto Links.

Thanks in advance.

carl
