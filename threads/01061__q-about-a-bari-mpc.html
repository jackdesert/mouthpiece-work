I have a mpc here that I am wondering about. It&#39;s a metal bari piece, very
thin, with a black plastic duckbill instead of a bite plate. Seems to be a
Brilhart, anyway around the shank it says "Designed by Arnold Brilhart",
serial # 5169, then a 5 (must be the tip opening). Quite a high baffle that
drops off abruptly ala Dukoff. Looks to be a well made piece; unfortunately
I don&#39;t have a bari so I don&#39;t know how it plays :-(

I&#39;ve been watchng for information about something similar but haven&#39;t run
across anything--just Brilhart "Tonalin" pieces, and was wondering if anyone
in the group could enlighten me about it.

Thanks in advance,

Toby

  The mouthpiece you describe is a 1960&#39;s Brilhart "Levelaire".  They are quite good if not the * facings.  The ones marked 4*, 5*, 6*, etc are very short facings, and harsh and resistant in the low register.  The long facing models play pretty well.  The 5 bari facing you describe should be .095" tip opening.

Paul,
  I have a tenor LevelAir 5* and I knew that the "*" indicated a 
shorter facing. Is the harshness and resistance that you describe 
supposed to be characteristic of the tenor pieces too?
