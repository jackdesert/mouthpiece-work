            <pre class='message__body'>The tip opening is .071� or 1.80 mm.  The facing length is 24 mm, I
think.  But for most tenor players, this tip opening is way too small,
even by classical standards.

I would suggest for most classical tenor players, with a Selmer
mouthpiece, a tip opening of .078�-.082� or 2.0 mm � 2.1 mm, with a
facing length of 25 mm.   This gives much better playing results.

The C* tenor facing is not proportional to the C* alto facing.  It is
more like the tenor B facing.  The tenor D or E facing is more like the
alto C* in playing characteristics.

When you rework the tip, make the baffle more straight from the tip rail
on back.  The Selmers usually have the baffle too curved, and the sound
too edgy for classical playing.

            <pre class='message__body'>The 161 (on the Eric Brand gauge) is 1.61 mm tip opening, or .063�.
That was the size of the OLD Soloist C* alto.  Now, the S80 C* measures
about .066� or 1.70mm.

The 44 indicates a 22 mm facing length.

            <pre class='message__body'>I missed that the original question was for a tenor C* facing.  In 
this case, the 50&#39;s curve from SJ is: 44, 35, 24, 16, 8, 167.  As 
Paul says, this is too close (.066") for most experianced players.

            <pre class='message__body'>Why are those mouthpieces even made? I can&#39;t imagine anyone trying to play one of those things for more than a few minutes. A  C* came with my MkVI thirty-some years ago and I discarded it immediately.
 
I tried a Selmer E on soprano and found it to play in tune well enough but  it was really hard to blow.
