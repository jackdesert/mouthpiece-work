think.  But for most tenor players, this tip opening is way too small,
even by classical standards.

I would suggest for most classical tenor players, with a Selmer
mouthpiece, a tip opening of .078�-.082� or 2.0 mm � 2.1 mm, with a
facing length of 25 mm.   This gives much better playing results.

The C* tenor facing is not proportional to the C* alto facing.  It is
more like the tenor B facing.  The tenor D or E facing is more like the
alto C* in playing characteristics.

When you rework the tip, make the baffle more straight from the tip rail
on back.  The Selmers usually have the baffle too curved, and the sound
too edgy for classical playing.

  The tip opening is .071" or 1.80 mm.  The facing length is 24 mm, I think.  But for most tenor players, this tip opening is way too small, even by classical standards. 
  I would suggest for most classical tenor players, with a Selmer mouthpiece, a tip opening of .078"-.082" or 2.0 mm - 2.1 mm, with a facing length of 25 mm.   This gives much better playing results. 

  The C* tenor facing is not proportional to the C* alto facing.  It is more like the tenor B facing.  The tenor D or E facing is more like the alto C* in playing characteristics. 

  When you rework the tip, make the baffle more straight from the tip rail on back.  The Selmers usually have the baffle too curved, and the sound too edgy for classical playing.
