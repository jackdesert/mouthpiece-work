It depends on what you want to do and your tolerance for risk.  Do you 
want to risk ruining this piece in order to gain experiance in closing 
it down?  If you want to close it down a lot, like from .115" where it 
is now to .090" (a "6"), it would probably be better to sell/trade it 
for something more in the ballpark.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------If this is your first experience with refacing, I would strongly recommend
starting out on something less valuable. I hacked up a few Yamaha 4Cs that my
students had chipped before I started to get the hang of refacing. If you're
anything like me, the risk of ruining your first refaced mouthpiece is very
high. I'd say sell it or have someone experienced reface it.
