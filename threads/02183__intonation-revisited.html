            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith and all.

I hope you don&#39;t mind revisiting the intonation issue. I&#39;ve been busy
repairing  school 
horns and have not had a chance to check my e-mail  for the past
month.

My question is this. I&#39;ve been opening up old crappy  mouthpieces ,
mostly with small 
choke style chambers and i&#39;m finding the general intonation on these
mouthpieces to be 
wonky when i&#39;m finished. What could make these  pieces play more out
of tune than my 
old slant n.y. mouthpiece that has the same tip opening. Is it the
small chamber, rails too 
skinny . etc.I&#39;ve noticed that Lakey mouthpieces have this same
problem, they tend to be 
wild and untamable. 

Thanks in advance,

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s pretty commonly accepted that, all other things equal, a smaller tip 
opening tends to emphasize the fundamental pitch and reduces the overtones.  
It could be that when you open up these small-chambered mouthpieces, you&#39;re 
aggravating a problem that was there all along, but was less noticeable 
thanks to the effect of the smaller tip opening.  Maybe the small chambers 
aren&#39;t the best match for the horns they&#39;re being played on.

Or it could be that whoever is playing these mouthpieces after they&#39;re 
opened up isn&#39;t accustomed to a larger tip opening, and just needs some time 
to get used to it.

When you open these up, are you also making the facing
curve longer?

You do not need to rely on reading Email.  All the message posts are

Yes I&#39;m legthening the facings Bob. For the last year and a half I&#39;ve been measuring vintage 
links and and any other mouthpieces that I find to play well . For fun I&#39;ve been trying to 
duplicate their work on similar  chambered mouthpieces.

Keith, thanks for pointing to the info in the archives , I thought I had checked for the 
answer to my queston there already, but I probably misssed it.
