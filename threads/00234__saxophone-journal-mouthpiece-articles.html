            <pre class='message__body'>Please excuse the length of this posting but my old academic 
instincts have crawled out again and I&#39;ve pulled together a list of 
mouthpiece articles which have appeared in the Saxophone Journal, 
according to their current website listings.

After discovering the large amount of information available, whether 
relevant to what we&#39;re discussing here or not, I wrote Ken Dorn to 
see if he had any plans of issuing a separate compilation of 
previously published articles (a monograph or small booklet) about 
mouthpieces.  It doesn&#39;t appear to be in the works.  According to 
him, at the moment, these articles can only be obtained by purchasing 
whatever back issues remain available.

Lists of articles for Issues 1-23 and 25, plus maybe 27 (if there was 
such as issue) do not appear on the Dorn Publications website.  Or, 
at the very least, I was unable to easily find them.

            <pre class='message__body'>You inspired me to go up to "the junk room" and sift through my box 
of SJ back issues.  I found I have from Vol 14, #2 to the present.

I&#39;m pretty sure Fred and Larry Wyman are the same person.  I Emailed 
him to find out why the 2 names.

I did not do carefull search, but I did find 2 Ralph Morgan columns 
not on your list: v15#6 and v18#6.  I added them below.  I also put 
some comments after some of the titles.

If anyone has the early ones I do not have let me know.  I might like 
to take a peek at them.
