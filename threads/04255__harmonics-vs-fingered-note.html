It has to do with the intonational irregularities inevitably introduced when the top of the cone is cut off in order to have a place to put the mouthpiece. The volume of the mpc should be equivalent to the volume of the truncated section of cone, or else you get tuning irregularities between the short tube notes and the long tube notes. But this shouldn&#39;t affect only one note, such as the F.

            <pre class='message__body'>It should be possible, but that will change the playing characteristics of the mpc, and might require reworking the baffle to balance the change in the chamber. I also wouldn&#39;t know whether you would have to enlarge the chamber or make it smaller--too much enlargement might be impossible, depending on the material of the mpc and the wall thickness.
