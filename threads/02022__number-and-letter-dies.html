            <pre class='message__body'>First, I received the set of five small feelers from Mr. Rosner, and
they are just as nice as the 7 large ones.  In fact, I ordered TWO
sets of the small, and one more of the large, so I now have two
complete 12 pc sets.  Excellent!

Also, I received from my friend Rocky Giglio at J. J. Babbit one of
their 0 edge glass guages.  Both are great backups to my Madison
Enterprises tools (John Winslow)!

Now, to the third handy item.  My wife found this item in one of the
gift and knick-knack catalogs she gets, Harriet Carter.  This is a set
of number and letter stamp dies, with a brass holder. This is all in a
nice looking little wood box with brass hinges and latch.  However,
the dies had little traces of rust here and there, not bad, as if
stored in a humid environment.  A little steel wool and a light
coating of oil should take care of this.  The number end appears to be
parkerized (a black fuzzy coating) and the end which goes in the
holder is raw machined steel.  The rust is only on these shiny
unparkerized areas.  Parkerizing is quite porous and will hold oil well.

www.harrietcarter.com   and phone in the USA is 1-800-377-7878.

The item number is C3910 Stamping Kit.  I think my wife told me the
kit was about $20.00 USD.  The back of the package says Jobar
International Item # JB3784.  

You insert the needed die, tighten with a set screw to hold it in
place, and rap it with a hammer.  Make sure you put something in the
bore to keep it from bending the mouthpiece.

My idea was to mostly use these on rubber and plastic mouthpieces that
I reface to larger sizes.  My plan is to heat the dies and melt in the
 size number.  Will let you know how this works after some
experimentation.

Of course, on a metal mouthpiece you would want
