This is a clinic that I gave at MusicMedic about saxophone mouthpieces in
February 2011. It was shot with a video camera on a tripod. Please do not
whine and complain about the quality, since it is costing you nothing.

One Question about minute 8 to 9: You give the right "MPC only" tones 
there for the different saxophones, but what would be the right tone for
