            <pre class='message__body'>This site is wonderful.
My problem is that I have a 400 meg total (download and upload) for the 
month. Usually anyone who sends messages over 400k that are not pre-
arranged, I block.
Whilst I do not expect everyone to bend to my whims, I can&#39;t see why it 
is necessary on a site like this to be sending huge messages with what 
seems to be mega pixells.
Surely ,if a more detailed photo than what is offered is required, it 
can be requested.
I appologize if I upset anyone with this message, but I am sure that I 
am not the only one in the boat here and if we all play the game 
responsibly, we will all prosper.

Seasons Greetings and Cheers to all.
