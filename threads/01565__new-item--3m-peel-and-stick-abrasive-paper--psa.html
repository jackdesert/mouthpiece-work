            <pre class='message__body'>All,

One of my other newly acquired interests is hand wood carving.
While perusing one of the many sites featuring carving tools -
and sharpening stones - I came across this site featuring
3M Micro Abrasive film (PSA)- which is basically Peel-n-stick
"sand" paper - tho the abrasive used is actually silicon carbide.

While I haven&#39;t yet tried it, this appears to solve the problem of
how to attach the abrasive paper to the glass surface when refacing
mouthpieces!!

From the web site (www.toolsforworkingwood.com):
"PSA (Pressure Sensitive Adhesive) abrasive lapping film is one of 
the one of the newest and most exciting methods of sharpening tools." 


and:
"The abrasives are carefully graded and electrostatically oriented 
for greater cutting efficiently. Even grading is very important for 
even cutting. You get fewer scratches, and more particles of abrasive 
at the same grit mean that more of the sheet cuts at the same time - 
faster and more evenly. Unlike more common Wet-or-Dry papers, these 
papers are designed for cutting metal and have the grit anchored in a 
layer of resin. The resin holds the grit to the paper in a very 
strong bond"


Here&#39;s the link:

If anyone has tried this product yet, please let us know what you
think of it!

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice find!  I just ordered some to try out.  I have tried PSA paper 
from:

http://www.sandpaper.ca/stick-on.shtml

This was mentioned in an earlier post my quick search did not find it.

But it is Al Oxide paper and it only goes to 600 grit.  It seems 
coarser than 600 grit Silicone Carbide.  They are OK for working on 
metal pieces and heavy table cutting when needed.  But the PSA often 
leaves a lot on the glass when peeled off.  Solvents clean it off, 
but its an annoying, smelly extra step.

I&#39;m hoping these papers will peel off easier.  Their problem may be 
that they are in grades that are too fine.

The other path I&#39;m persuing is having several EZ Lap plates, each 
with a different grade of paper loaded.  These are discussed in the 
archives and there are some photos on the MPWork site.

a post that someone was not getting a response from the manufacturer?

do you actually own an EZ Lap machine?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have one.  They used to be a little slow shipping because they were
mostly made to order or they only stock a few.  I just ordered 2 more and
was told they were "in stock", but I do not know how many they have ready
to go.  They are $50 + 15 s/h.

            <pre class='message__body'>Isn&#39;t this how facets on diamonds and other jewels are polished?

A high polish is really not necessary on the table/facing.  But you want 
a little shine there, just for cosmetic reasons.

I flip a piece of 600 or 800 paper upside down, that is, paper backing 
side up.  A few strokes on the table like that, and one stroke on the 
facing itself will give a nice polish to hard rubber, plastic, or metal 
pieces.  There seems to be just enough very fine silicon carbide dust in 
the paper to give a nice polish.

I got some 40u and 15u in today.  The 40 is like a 400 grit and the 
15 is like a 800 or so.  The Silicon Carbide is on a Mylar film with 
an adheasive backing.  The Mylar is a really nice backing since it 
does not want to curl or ripple.  Even without the PSA I think it 
would be better than regular sandpaper.  

You need to be carefull when putting the pressing PSA backed paper 
down on a flat surface so you do not trap air bubbles underneath it.  
I cut each sheet in half and put one of each grit side-by-side on a 
3/8" thick 9x11 glass plate.

This is really good stuff.  It holds up well and vacuums off easy.  
Highly recommended.  I have only used it on a brass piece so far, but 
I think it will be great on all materials.
