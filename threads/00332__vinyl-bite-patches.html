I have a chipped tooth and go thru these patches pretty quickly

I thought I found the "holy grail" when I was told to try making my

clear vinyl material used to paste on motorcycle windshields 
especially when riders want to stick numbers or other things on. Well 
it works alright and is about as strong as the other patches but the 
peel off backing and glue does not work as well as the VanDoren 
patches. The self made ones seem to slip off after warming up for a 
couple of uses and it can get you crazy when it happens on a gig.

You may be satisfied with only the clear ones.  But the clear and black

me, you can place a black patch on the mouthpiece, and directly on top

tougher clear material prevents bite through.

            <pre class='message__body'>The clear Runyon/Selmer patches will stay on very well.  The adhesive
will keep it on for well over a year.  I have had some on for two or
three years with no problem.  If you peel it off, it will not leave a
gummy mess, but come off fairly cleanly.

            <pre class='message__body'>The other area to explore is reducing the sharpness of the chipped 
tooth.  A dentist can lightly sand it so the edge is rounded some 
while still retaining its jagged charm.  They could even do more 
extensive restoration work, but heck, I&#39;ve got a cool flex shaft rig 
and a neat selection of epoxies.  Send the tooth to me and I&#39;ll fix 
it no charge.  What color do you want it?

            <pre class='message__body'>The only thing that I can think of that will stick to virtually 
anything is "sikaflex"... But you don&#39;t want to use that stuff... 
It&#39;s goop to put on, nearly impossible to get off again, and probably 
highly toxic... Sorry I&#39;m not of any help on this one...

            <pre class='message__body'>Brian,
I just thought of something... Would you beileve...

Electrical insulation tape...

Perhaps I&#39;m sounding like an echo now, but a couple of layers of that 
stuff will last a while (probably about 5 or 6 hours of playing for 
me, and I have a very slightly chipped tooth - but not as badly 
chipped as your tooth seems to be like), and you&#39;re not likely to get 
anything any cheaper. The drawback of this stuff is that it can start 
to slip/stretch a bit after a while, but if you replace it every 
practice session/gig, then it shouldn&#39;t be too bad. On the other 
hand, if you have to replace it every drink break during a gig, 
you&#39;re still not out of pocket, because you can get a pack of a few 
rolls of the stuff (a couple of hundred metres of it) for next to 
nothing, so it&#39;s still likely to be a lot cheaper than the Vandoren 
bits pads.
:-)

By the way... I also use the same tape to build up the thickness of 
my cork, because I can&#39;t be bothered taking my sax to the repair man 
to get it fixed properly...
