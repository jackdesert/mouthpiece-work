            <pre class='message__body'>Hi-

I want to list a SILVER Otto Link Baritone mouthpiece, but am not sure which "era" it&#39;s from, and what the asking price could be.  I don&#39;t want to let something go for $25o if it could get $800 like I see out there today.

Is there anyone who could estimate from the looks of it what year it might be from.  Also, it has been worked on (opened to 8, with a baffle), although the baffle couldd be removed (it&#39;s acrylic)  Incidentally, it plays great!

If someone emails back to me at lthom172@..., I think I can attach pictures.  

Thanks for the help, Lori
