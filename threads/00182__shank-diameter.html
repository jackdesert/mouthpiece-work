            <pre class='message__body'>We went over this some time ago, about how silly it is that the shape and size of the rear of the mouthpiece chamber is determined by a piece of cork, which solves a purely mechanical problem, instead of acoustical considerations having priority in the design.  

It all depends on how you want the volume distributed.  I believe that older Links had a smaller throat diameter so the mouthpiece could be wider at the tip and the side walls more rounded, resulting in a more spread, variable sound.

I read somewhere that the real reason for the Conn Micro Tuner was because the designers felt that keeping the throat at neck opening diameter, up to the actual rounded chamber, had distinct acoustical advantages.

Those of us who own multiple mouthpieces all know that there is a significant variation between brands in the diameter of the shank, resulting in poor fit for some on the neck and the lack of interchangeability without applying teflon tape or paper as a spacer.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would have thought that someone who "designs" saxophone mouthpieces
for a living would have created  several prototypes of different shank
diameters to determine by "building and trying" whether it makes an
acoustic difference or not.  That said, I suspect that it does
not---simply adding the the overall mouthpiece volume which determines
the pitch and therefore the tuning position on the cork.

Many of the customers I work with on a daily basis have bought
Cannonball saxes that come with two necks.  They were the first company
to do so, and like so many of their other original ideas it has been
copied by other vendors.   Quite a few of these players play in both
classical and jazz styles with different set-ups.

Since they usually prefer the sound of one neck over the other for each
style, it is a simple matter to fit the cork of each neck to the
mouthpiece used.  For these players playing Cannonballs, different
mouthpiece shank sizes are no problem at all.

We sold almost a thousand mouthpieces last (2009) year, and I don&#39;t  
recall getting more than three complaints on this topic. Yes, we try  
variations on every product we bring to market to see what works best.

I seem to recall that we went through about six different shank  
configurations, and frankly, neither I or anyone on our play testing  
posse could tell the least bit of difference in the way they played.  
As Lance said, it is purely a mechanical connection insofar as I can  
determine. I was seeking further information, if it exists. Sometimes  
a cigar is just a cigar. We DID find that increasing the mass at the  
shank end tends to increase performance.

I&#39;m pretty sure that all those at the top of their game, in any field, make a point of regularly "beating the bushes" for new ideas.  It&#39;s a tried-and-true formula.  Only the idiot thinks he can&#39;t learn anything from others.

I have to disagree completely.  

There is no such thing as an "unimportant" part of the air column.  Everything matters.  

As already mentioned regarding older Otto Links, making the shank diameter smaller enabled making the mouthpiece tip wider and rounding out the side walls, for more chamber volume closer to the reed.  While these may not be everyone&#39;s ideal mouthpiece, they certainly are prized by many, and have a distinctive sound and response which would not be possible were the shank the same size as every other mouthpiece.

Bear, of CyberSax wrote, "The real purpose of
the micro tuner is misunderstood. Conn was really after getting the 
mouthpiece
chamber into the ideal position vs. the end of the neck . There are 
sonic
benefits..."

I&#39;m inclined to agree.  

It might be more accurate to say that you personally don&#39;t perceive any good acoustical reason to have different shank diameters.  Regardless, there are those who obviously do.

While these may not be everyone&#39;s ideal mouthpiece, they certainly are prized by many, and have a
 distinctive sound and response which would not be possible were the shank the same size as every other mouthpiece.

I&#39;m inclined to agree.  

It might be more accurate to say that you personally don&#39;t perceive any good acoustical reason to have different shank diameters.  Regardless, there are those who obviously do.

The only people who will be happy will be those who can&#39;t tell the difference between a good vintage Link and a stock STM, and are therefore more concerned about their cork than their sound.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Conn micro-tuner actually lengthened the neck and therefore the saxophone much like a brass instrument tuning slide.  In so doing it slightly altered the degree of truncation, and more importantly the volume of the "missing cone".  At one time I thought that the microtuner was a perfect way to match the volume of the missing cone with the mouthpiece and then "fine tune" the Frs with the tuner until I realized that each time the length of the neck changes, so does the missing cone volume.

On the older Otto Links, wouldn&#39;t just moving the mouthpiece a bit farther onto the neck compensate for the added chamber volume closer to the reed?  Common sense tells me that would be the case.

            <pre class='message__body'>I believe it is a non-sequitur "it does not follow" flawed argument to state that the vintage otto link is a superior mouthpiece, the vintage otto link has a narrower shank, therefore the narrow shank makes it a superior mouthpiece.  There are far too many variables inside a mouthpiece for this to be stated with any real certainty.  Of course one can "believe" anything they like, so long as they don&#39;t state it as though it were a proven fact.

            <pre class='message__body'>We believe that more mass at the shank end increases response....hence  
we make them a bit longer than some other brands.....this also helps  
reduce wiggling, of course. We have no evidence other than anecdotal  
reports and the observations of our play testing posse to support the  
belief in increased mass....I know that many brass manufacturers have  
employed this principle for some time. On a couple of our models, we  
increased the mass on the shank somewhat significantly, and believe  
this made a significant difference in the performance of those  
particular designs. If there are any studies which support or refute  
this contention, I do not have them in my library.

We also contend that increasing the overall mass of the mouthpiece  
(not just the shank) improves response, and have done considerable  
experimenting with different materials (primarily various brass  
alloys) and wall thickness. I strongly disagree with the contention  
that material doesn&#39;t matter. Again, our evidence is anecdotal and  
based on extensive play testing. Our vendor who supplies our brass (a  
Japanese company) provided us with billets of different compositions,  
and we found that reducing the zinc content in the alloy was  
beneficial in that it provided a larger spectrum of overtones and gave  
a richer, more complex sound. There seemed to be a point of  
diminishing return on this reduction, and we selected an alloy that we  
thought gave the sound we wanted.

The same principle appears to apply to non-metallic mouthpieces as  
well. We have found that for some applications a rubber based  
composite is more responsive.

It would certainly make sense to blind test mpcs of different weight and composition to see if what is perceived when certain facts are known (about weight and composition) is the same as that which is perceived when they are hidden. This would be relataively easy to do--at least with metal mpcs.
 Let me remind you that in Coltman&#39;s experiments with flutes, most all the players (professionals) thought they could detect clear and consistent differences between the flutes, and then were generally dumbfounded to find out that they could not tell them apart when visual and tactile clues were
 removed.

On a purely practical level it makes no sense to carry out such a test--it only does so if one is interested in what does what and why.

I&#39;m not going to do a bunch of empirical blind tests because I don&#39;t  
have the time. I believe what I hear, and so do our customers. I&#39;m  
somewhat familiar with Coltman&#39;s study, having read it at some point  
in the past.

If you&#39;ve got one around the house, play a Bari Hawk with and without  
the removable shank weight and you will hear a remarkable difference.

            <pre class='message__body'>"Make the shank slightly larger in diameter, push in the mpc a fraction more. Everybody is happy and the mpc fits on the cork."

If the mouthpiece volume becomes too large due to shank diameter, pushing in to reduce the volume will shorten the length, and the registers will be out of tune.  A smaller shank reduces the volume to the correct amount, and enables the wider, larger chamber up front, without shortening the mouthpiece, and maintains the correct frs.

I believe it is a non-sequitur "it does not follow" flawed argument to 
state that the vintage otto link is a superior mouthpiece, the vintage 
otto link has a narrower shank, therefore the narrow shank makes it a 
superior mouthpiece.  There are far too many variables inside a 
mouthpiece for this to be stated with any real certainty.  Of course one
 can "believe" anything they like, so long as they don&#39;t state it as 
though it were a proven fact.



This non-sequitur statement is entirely your own fabrication and makes a very telling statement of it&#39;s own when compared to what I actually stated, posted below:

"While these may not be 
everyone&#39;s ideal mouthpiece, they certainly are prized by many, and have
 a distinctive sound and response which would not be possible were the 
shank the same size as every other mouthpiece."

Many people owning saxophones, do not play well enough to notice the difference between a good vintage Link and any other mouthpiece.  This says nothing about which mouthpiece is superior - only that there is a difference, and it is primarily those who can&#39;t tell the audible difference, who are so concerned about their neck cork.

I have found that the difference between a loose and well-fitting mouthpiece shank to be .010" on the diameter.  If the change occurs only on the shank part that covers the cork, there will be no geometry change inside the part of the mouthpiece that participates in the acoustics.  Evan if it does go into the chamber, its only .010".  The difference from reed-to-reed will be larger.  
 
Some say a tighter fit on the cork plays better.  I just think if it is loose enough that it leaks or wiggles, that can be a problem.

I&#39;ll have a full report on this in a day or so.  Preliminary results:

Pushing in reduces length AND volume considerably, and raises pitch considerably.

Reducing shank diameter reduces volume slightly and lowers pitch considerably

A slight reduction in shank diameter and in shank length results in a considerable reduction in volume and varying change in pitch.  

It would appear that volume and frs can be controlled and balanced only by a combination of length and diameter adjustment.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

When I talked to Joe Wolfe, the acoustic scientist, about this he said that while the scientific community knows that there is a strong belief among players and makers about the effect of material and weight, none of them (including some very accomplished players) can find any physical explanation
 for why it should be so, nor are able to demonstrate it in blind tests. I tend to believe Coltman&#39;s explanation, in talking about his experiment:

"...the musician cannot, under normal playing circumstances, dissociate his personal preferences and prejudices from the question at hand. In the case of the three &#39;flutes&#39; I constructed, nearly every player who picked them up and tried them had a preference for one or the other. Often he would
 describe his impressions--the wooden flute has a &#39;fuller&#39; tone, the silver one &#39;projects&#39; much better, etc. He was then usually baffle to find that he could not identify any of the instruments under the &#39;blindfold&#39; conditions I described. The plain facts are that his judgment is influenced by
 preconceived notions and mental associations of tone quality with other properties of the material. This is a normal human reaction, intensified in the case of those trained to incorporate feeling into their art, and to whom the instrument becomes, in effect, an extension of their own body and
 personality. I do not belittle this attitude; it is, I believe, a desirable condition for the achievement of the fullest artistic expression. It is just not suited for answering narrow, objective questions like the one I posed..."

The ONLY way to know what is really going on is to limit the variables in play and tightly control conditions, so that the foregoing tendencies are eliminated. It doesn&#39;t make a whiff of difference if the player is a rank amateur of the greatest virtuoso, the same human fallibilities pertain, and
 perhaps even more so in the more accomplished player. 

I&#39;m not saying that you should spend time and money proving or disproving the point. If you are happy and the players are happy then at the end of the day it really doesn&#39;t matter. I do, however, feel honor-bound to present the scientific-consensual opinion whenever anyone makes statements about
 materials that haven&#39;t been adequately tested. Just for the record...

I&#39;m interested in the "why". I know that neck materials make a significant difference (we sell a series of horns
 with two different necks, made on the exact same tooling to the exact specification. The only differene is the material) which I can clearly hear, along with EVERYONE else who has tried them. I also note that my company is far from being alone in offering saxophones made from different alloys.
 This has been going on for many years.


I&#39;m not going to do a bunch of empirical blind tests because I don&#39;t have the time. I believe what I hear, and so do our customers. I&#39;m somewhat familiar with Coltman&#39;s study, having read it at some point in the past.


If you&#39;ve got one around the house, play a Bari Hawk with and without the removable shank weight and you will hear a remarkable difference.

As far as the science goes, insofar as what is known, there is absolutely no reason why any of this should be true, and no one can come up with any reason why either mass or material should make a significant difference. 

It would certainly make sense to blind test mpcs of different weight and composition to see if what is perceived when certain facts are known (about weight and composition) is the same as that which is perceived when they are hidden. This would be relataively easy to do--at least with metal mpcs.
 Let me remind you that in Coltman&#39;s experiments with flutes, most all the players (professionals) thought they could detect clear and consistent differences between the flutes, and then were generally dumbfounded to find out that they could not tell them apart when visual and tactile clues were
 removed.

On a purely practical level it makes no sense to carry out such a test--it only does so if one is interested in what does what and why.

belief in increased mass....I know that many brass manufacturers have 
employed this principle for some time. On a couple of our models, we 
increased the mass on the shank somewhat significantly, and believe 
this made a significant difference in the performance of those 
particular designs. If there are any studies which support or refute 
this contention, I do not have them in my library.

We also contend that increasing the overall mass of the mouthpiece 
(not just the shank) improves response, and have done considerable 
experimenting with different materials (primarily various brass 
alloys) and wall thickness. I strongly disagree with the contention 
that material doesn&#39;t matter. Again, our evidence is anecdotal and 
based on extensive play testing. Our vendor who supplies our brass (a 
Japanese company) provided us with billets of different compositions, 
and we found that reducing the zinc content in the alloy was 
beneficial in that it provided a larger spectrum of overtones and gave 
a richer, more complex sound. There seemed to be a point of 
diminishing return on this reduction, and we selected an alloy that we 
thought gave the sound we wanted.

The same principle appears to apply to non-metallic mouthpieces as 
well. We have found that for some applications a rubber based 
composite is more responsive.

I&#39;ll have a full report on this in a day or so.  Preliminary results:

Pushing in reduces length AND volume considerably, and raises pitch considerably.

Reducing shank diameter reduces volume slightly and lowers pitch considerably

A slight reduction in shank diameter and in shank length results in a considerable reduction in volume and varying change in pitch.  

It would appear that volume and frs can be controlled and balanced only by a combination of length and diameter adjustment.

 what degree does pushing a larger-volume mpc slightly further on the cork change the tuning?

My own experiences and experiments show that within a certain reasonable range the differences are so minor as to be almost imperceptible, and easily masked by small changes in reed placement, embouchure and breath variations, etc.

My own personal opinion, here on record as in our lengthy debate about resos, is that you are making entirely too much of extremely small changes.

When you change the mpc position due to temperature variations of 10 degrees or so, or because the horn gets warmed up, do you suddenly notice huge changes in intonation, response and timbre?

If the mouthpiece volume becomes too large due to shank diameter, pushing in to reduce the volume will shorten the length, and the registers will be out of tune.  A smaller shank reduces the volume to the correct amount, and enables the wider, larger chamber up front, without shortening the
 mouthpiece, and maintains the correct frs.

I believe it is a non-sequitur "it does not follow" flawed argument to  state that the vintage otto link is a superior mouthpiece, the vintage  otto link has a narrower shank, therefore the narrow shank makes it a  superior mouthpiece.  There are far too many variables inside a  mouthpiece for
 this to be stated with any real certainty.  Of course one  can "believe" anything they like, so long as they don&#39;t state it as  though it were a proven fact.
  
This non-sequitur statement is entirely your own fabrication and makes a very telling statement of it&#39;s own when compared to what I actually stated, posted below:

"While these may not be  everyone&#39;s ideal mouthpiece, they certainly are prized by many, and have  a distinctive sound and response which would not be possible were the  shank the same size as every other mouthpiece."

Many people owning saxophones, do not play well enough to notice the difference between a good vintage Link and any other mouthpiece.  This says nothing about which mouthpiece is superior - only that there is a difference, and it is primarily those who can&#39;t tell the audible difference, who are so
 concerned about their neck cork.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

I used my tenor mouthpiece as my example.  It goes on the cork well over 1" - almost 40mm, and I did not give an exact number.  I said "almost 3 ml", which could mean 2.69 ml, in anyone&#39;s book.  I think you would do better, trying to figure how many angels can fit on the head of a pin, than what you are doing now.  Ha, ha.

You are missing the entire point though.  Remember, not everyone is interested in making generic saxophones or mouthpieces, that work well for everyone, in every situation.  The saxophone or mouthpiece that is intended to be used by high school students on the winter football field, in a spring indoor concert, and for the summer parade, will have entirely different design criteria than that which a fine artist would use in a climate controlled concert hall or recording studio.

I&#39;m interested in designing one specific mouthpiece for one specific horn, for one specific player, who had refined his reed adjusting skills to the point where the reeds that are used are very consistent.  Acoustical criteria have absolute priority over the purely mechanical.   For my purposes, it serves nothing to be concerned about whether the shank of my mouthpiece will fit on a high school marching band saxophone&#39;s neck cork or not. 

We have entirely different objectives for our acoustic pursuits here.  I&#39;m interested in what makes a Stradivarius a Stradivarius, as opposed to a Yamaha AV7.  You appear to be interested primarily in what makes a Yamah AV7 a Yamaha AV7.  There is nothing wrong with either.

      And whoa! wait a minute. Are you saying, Lance, that a diameter difference of .01" across an effective length of throat of (generally) way less than 1" equals .3 ml, something equivalent to  around1.5% of the entire volume of the mpc?? Can I see your math please?

                                      I have found that the difference between a loose and well-fitting mouthpiece shank to be 
 .010" on the diameter.  If the change occurs only on the shank part that covers the cork, there will be no geometry change inside the part of the mouthpiece that participates in the acoustics.  Evan if it does go into the chamber, its only .010".  The difference from reed-to-reed 
 will be larger.     Some say a tighter fit on the cork plays better.  I just think if it is loose enough that it leaks or wiggles, that can be a problem.

The only people who will be happy will be those who can&#39;t tell the difference between a good vintage Link and a stock STM, and are therefore more concerned about their cork than their sound.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lance,

I totally respect your skills and objectives; I do think, however, that at times you overestimate the effects of small parameters in the overall picture. I understand that you wish to get everything as perfect as possible, and that is a noble goal, but I am concerned that others who are more
 generically interested will get the wrong idea, and go off obsessively on a small point while ignoring other much more important aspects of design.
