            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys

I just did my first modification on the facing curve on a tenor Yamaha 5C rubber (or plastic) mouthpiece. It was playing not good so, I took the chance and worked on it. These are the final measurements I did:

0.0015     46
0.010      33.5
0.024      22.5
0.034      18.8
0.050      10.3

Tip opening: 0.080

Can anybody help me giving me your comments please? 

The piece plays much better now, I´m very happy I did I good job, but I wonder if this is the right curve for this tip opening. 

Thank you very much.
Sincerely
Gerardo

            <pre class='message__body'>I think this would be more responsive.  It is a radial curve for .080", 46L

Hi guys

I just did my first modification on the facing curve on a tenor Yamaha 5C rubber 
(or plastic) mouthpiece. It was playing not good so, I took the chance and 
worked on it. These are the final measurements I did:

0.0015 46
0.010 33.5
0.024 22.5
0.034 18.8
0.050 10.3

Tip opening: 0.080

Can anybody help me giving me your comments please? 

The piece plays much better now, I´m very happy I did I good job, but I wonder 
if this is the right curve for this tip opening. 


Thank you very much.
Sincerely
Gerardo

            <pre class='message__body'>Are radial curves always the best option? if not, how do you know when to use other kind? Is that just a matter of experience? like saying "I know Otto Links work perfect with this measurements... even though they don´t produce a radial or eliptical curve".......????

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>Just like there is no best mouthpiece, there is no best curve.  A radial curve 
is a good place to start as you learn facing work.  It may even be a good place 
to stop.

A well made radial curve will beat out a so-so implemented elliptical curve or 
any other curve shape.  The family of elliptical curves are just a way to add 
some "good" resistance.  You can also add resistance with a harder reed, shorter 
facing and/or a more open tip.  There are trade-offs with each approach.
