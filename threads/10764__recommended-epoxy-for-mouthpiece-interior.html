here in Australia will probably not be relevant to where you are, but I&#39;ve
used several brands and find them all to be pretty well the same. Most give

conventional hand tools.

I&#39;m looking for a good material for applying to the mouthpiece interior. Is
there something other than J&B Weld for this use. I want something that you
can work after it sets.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been through that with a HR piece of mine in the last days,

For health issues that may arise with the epoxy putty available here in Italy I choose dental prothesis material, it&#39;s a 2 component resin that has a very quick working time, around 2 minutes before it starts to harden, and it can be filed and sanded afterwards.

The resin didn&#39;t really stick to the ebonite though and it detached, but it had taken the exact shape of the surface it has to adhere, the interior of the mpc roof, then I fixed it with a little coat of 2 components epoxy glue, 12 hours curing time. The color is light yellow, if that&#39;s important to you.

I&#39;ve been lucky to find a dental protesis technician who prepared a small amount of material for me at his lab and I had to put it in the mpc while there, he also passed me a couple of spatulas, eventually asking me nothing, such a great guy, otherwise, at least here in Italy the dental resin can be found at dental material salers in half a kilogram package, or bought online in 100 grams package.

I hope this can help, good luck,

            <pre class='message__body'>JB Weld can be filed and sanded after it sets.  High speed rotary tool too.  It also sets slow so you can reshape it after about an hour or so before it gets too hard.  Jon Van Wie used to do this.
 
I prefer to use epoxy putties for adding baffles so I don&#39;t have to wait to shape them.  Black Apoxie Fix-It is good for HR mouthpieces and comes in small quantities.  I find quick-set plumbers&#39; epoxies hold better in metal mouthpieces.  You need to shape them in 1-2 minutes to avoid a lot of filing.

apoxie sculpt is what I use.  non-toxic, works like clay before it sets, files and sands well when set, even polishes ok.  Long work time, cure time is at least 24 hours.
