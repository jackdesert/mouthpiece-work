            <pre class='message__body'>When measuring mouthpieces, does the actual THICKNESS (+/-) of the
feelers listed in the spreadsheet matter, or is the number of
DIFFERENT thickness feelers between the table and the tip more
important.  On most of my mouthpieces, when I make the measurements
and then try to input the measurements into Keith&#39;s spreadsheet, there
are, usually, several cells that are left empty because my pieces have
small tip openings and short lays.

Thank you,

David

            <pre class='message__body'>The actual thickness is important.  You should measure you set of feelers
with calipers or a micrometer and input what you are using.  You can delete
or insert a row if needed.
