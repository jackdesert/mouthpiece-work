Let there be light.

It turns out that my new feeler gauges are quite accuratly ground, but
one of the heavy ones in the .050 stack, had bumps on one side of one 
end....
Left over from the stamping process?

At any rate they were big enough to see with a lens...

If the stack was used bump side up, it measured accuratly.
Bump side down, added significantly to it&#39;s height....:(

These weren&#39;t cheapy gauges....

Feeling slightly better, Ross

You should also check your calipers and micrometers with a guage block
occassionally.  

So Ross, do you need help with your latest curve?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith

The measurements in message 2954 are accurate, and have made your suggested curve unachievable....
If you could suggest another curve using the numbers from 2954 that would be great, but It may require relapping the table to get rid of the dip.

I mentioned the deformed tips because they are very hard to see, and aren&#39;t situated so that you&#39;re likely to find them with a mic test....
If anyone&#39;s getting inconsistent readings, it might be worth looking looking for tiny deformations.....
Mine appeared to put in during the shearing process, were only on one side, only on the ends, and only on a few of the thickest feelers.

It might save someone else spoiling their efforts.

Ross

  Cheapy or not, it is a good practice to check your guages with a micrometer
  or caliper and use your measured dimensions in the spreadsheets when
  generating facing curves.

  You should also check your calipers and micrometers with a guage block
  occassionally.  

  So Ross, do you need help with your latest curve?
