            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d be pleased and honored to meet any members of this group attending the 
IAJE convention in New York next week.

I will be appearing on behalf of L. A. Sax. We will be showing our new Steve

Goodson Model alto, our new saxello, and the new Saxgourmet Model Six (which

replaces the Chicago Jazz Series), as well as the new models (alto, tenor, 
and soprano) in the standard L. A. Sax line.

We will also be doing free  written saxophone appraisals and minor 
instrument repairs and adjustments (on any brand, not just L. A. Sax) at our

booth.

I will have an assortment of Saxgourmet brand products available at the 
show, including DVD&#39;s, Saxgourmet reeds, Saxgourmet thumb rests, Neck 
Enhancers, Mojo&#39;s Never Stick Pad Powder, Steve&#39;s Voodoo Pad Juice, and 
Bourbon Street Key Oil. I may possibly have the new Saxgourmet tenor 
mouthpiece if the plater gets them done in time. 

I look forward to the opportunity to meet you at the show!

 

"The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
