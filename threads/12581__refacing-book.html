            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys
 

 I stumbled upon this book by Theo Wanne about refacing

 

 It has instructions on how to flatten a table, measure a facing curve and just like sorts of stuff we do here.
 

 However I was stuck on a certain page of the book where there is a stated curve numbers for Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Baritone mouthpieces but instead of indicating the numbers with 10 feelers, he only put 5. 
 

 I also noticed that measurement on Tip Rail thickness is also not present in the book

 

 Is he measuring the tip rail thickness when refacing? If yes, what is the tip rail measurement that he uses? 

  
 Who else has Theo Wanne's Refacing book here?

 

 What can you say about it?
 

 Thank you
