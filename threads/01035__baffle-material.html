            <pre class='message__body'>In a previous question I asked, Keith described how to figure out how 
much baffle one might want to place into a mouthpiece using temporary 
material like putty or playdough, I used non toxic modeling clay with 
plastic instruments- a kit for kids to make molds I found in a craft 
store section. How does the more permanent epoxy material affect the 
sound? Does the type of epoxy affect this? Is epoxy permanent or can 
it be taken out or modified? Which type of epoxy is best? Plumbers? 
Isn&#39;t it toxic?

Epoxies are generally poisonous when they are in their separate parts and inert when thoroughly mixed and cured.  You will have to ask the manufacturer of the particular brand you are using,

            <pre class='message__body'>Many epoxies contain xeroestrogens (notably alpha bisphenol)--estrogen mimicing chems that have been implicated in things like testicular cancers and falling sperm counts, and which do their dirty work in exteremely small dosages--parts per billion. However these usually affect developing endocrine systems (children and fetuses) and toxicity per se is low. Stephen Howard put the question of safety to the makers of JB Weld and while they were vague they did say specifically that it would be better if it didn&#39;t come into contact with the mouth, even after it is completely set.

But I can&#39;t imagine that there would be a problem using epoxy for a baffle, as there is never direct oral contact with that part of the mpc. I would definitely think twice or three times though before using it to fill in tooth grooves or reconstruct tips, etc.

I have been wondering about that, especially since a noted mouthpiece technician who touted the use of this material recently died of a very bad and aggressive cancer.
 
Some years ago, I had Ernie Northway make a custom mouthpiece for me. It arrived with  a rollover baffle made of a material which was the same color as the mouthpiece. I wonder what that material was.

I wonder if it is possible for toxins to leach out of
the baffle, combine with the moisture (condensation
and saliva) which could get absorbed into the reed.

I must say that I often think of what happened to JVW

            <pre class='message__body'>The estrogen mimics apparently wreak havoc only on developing endocrine
systems, setting the stage for endocrine imbalances that lead to later
problems. AFAIK they are not carcinogenic as such. I really doubt that there
would be any problem using epoxies as baffle material. You could also coat
them with a sealant if you were really worried, although I don&#39;t know what
would be recommendable. Superglue, although it is very nasty before it sets,
is totally inert afterwards.

I was thinking that it would be worthwhile investigating dental supply
houses for various plastics and/or epoxies. If they are used in the mouth
for the long term I would guess that they must be safe. The white stuff that
is used for temporary fillings (set by ultraviolet light) would be perfect.
Plus there are lots of dental sealants that could be applied over epoxies
that are questionable.

When I use epoxies for filling teeth marks in the beak, I use Devcon 5

clear patch.

HI,
I have a selmer classique metal c* soprano m/p which I am modifying 
slightly.
I have opened the tip slightly and find that it is now to my liking, 
however I would like to put some material into the m/p to make the 
baffle less steep(to give the m/p more brightness). At present the 
baffle has a shelf about 1/4" from the tip which then falls steeply. 
At present the m/p is not bright enough for me. I have put a small 
amount of putty into the m/p to reduce the steepness somewhat and 
this has nicely made the piece brighter and more to my liking.
can you suggest a safe material that I can use to permanently form 
this raising of the baffle area as it drops into the bore. The amount 
of putty I used was no more than the size of a pea which I pressed 
down and shaped to suit.
As I said earlier the m/p plays really well it just lacks a little 
brightness.
your comments will be greatly appreciated.
Kind regards. Peter

I use a Plumber&#39;s epoxy putty by Oatey.  I get it at Home Depot in the US.

Back around message #2478, there was some discussion about dental 
acrylics as a fill material or bite plate material. This is the stuff 
they make dental appliances and retainers from. I did some minimal 
research and found that they used this stuff early on at beauty 
salons to attach fake nails.  Apparently, there were some health 
issues with it so they modified the acrylic to be safer for using in 
nail salons. So, the nail salons now use a modified acylic formula. 
Chemistry is not my forte, so I suppose you could do some research on 
the net and get some more details.

Anyway, I found that you can go to your local Walgreens and get a 
nail kit for about $6.00.  It includes a small bottle of liquid 
monomer and a small bottle of powdered polymer and a small brush. You 
dip the brush in the liquid, dap the wet brush in the powder then 
apply to the mouthpiece. I have built-up a slight roll-over baffle on 
a 1920&#39;s vintage Buescher hard rubber, large chamber, Bb tenor 
mouthpiece with this stuff.  It works pretty well. It does not take 
much powder to get it fairly thick. Prior to building up the baffle, 
I could not play any of the high palm keys. After the build up, the 
palms key can now speak. I picked up the clear acrylic kit.

Power Tone baffles are a quick and relatively easy way to add to the 
baffle.  They stay in place for a long time so long as the baffle is 
flat where they are applied.

There&#39;s a knack to placing them as the effect is greater the closer 
you put it to the tip, but you don&#39;t want the reed banging into it as 
you play.

A relatively cheap (and not-messy) way to experiment without having 
to break out the epoxy.

Granted, with epoxy, you can blend things over a distance and into 
the walls, etc.  But if you&#39;re simply looking to brighten things up a 
touch, I highly recommend these.
