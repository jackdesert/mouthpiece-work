Hi:

Can anyone give me a good facing schedule for a Selmer Long shank 
Soloist E rubber alto, (morgan gauge)?  I have a D coming in that I 
would like to open up a little?

Thanks,

BK

BK, 

Could you post a schedule of your D soloist before you start to work 
on it. I have a C soloist that was supposed to have been opened up to 
an E but the tip opening seems more like a D to me. 

Thanks.

Sure, I can but Selmers are real inconsistent so it
might be a bad facing.  When I get the piece, I will
though.

For Tip 80-85, .040" should probably be 16.  Then all 3 look like the 
same curve slid back 2 numbers between them (1 mm).
