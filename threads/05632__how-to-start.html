            <pre class='message__body'>For me, the best way to start is to go back and read ALL of the old
messages.  There are also a lot of good references in the Files area
of the MouthpieceWork site.  Check out all of those; check out all of
the pictures in the Photos area well as the Links section.  You will
find a WHOLE LOT of information there.

Hope this helps some.

            <pre class='message__body'>This site has been successful at collecting the information you need.  It
is not intended to teach this craft, though it will surely help.  You need
to put in some work to learn how to extract the information gathered on the
