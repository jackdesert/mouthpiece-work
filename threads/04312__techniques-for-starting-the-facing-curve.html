            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m finding it very difficult to start my facing curve correctly. I
tend to take too much material off at the very start of the curve,
where the flat part of the table begins its radial climb to the tip.

I imagine it is extremely important that the curve begin gradually,
and yet it seems safer (and for me so far, more successful) to take
off less material and let the curve start a but more abruptly. I mean
this is the sense of not doing much (or any) removal between the start
of the curve and where the .0015 measurement is taken.

Any technique recommendations, or am I worrying about a relatively
minor issue?

I find it is best to leave the lengths short by 1-3 glass gage numbers
until you get the rest of the facing curve done.  Usually by the time I&#39;m
done, the facing length crept up close to target anyhow.

Hi:

That is a good idea.  Maybe that&#39;s why Eric Brand kind
of had a similar idea about the curve in general.

By the way, any takers on my Berg Bari sax question
which was:  Do all metal Bergs have bullet chambers or
do some ones over 2 or 3 have a step baffle like the
tenor pieces?

Thanks,

Bob

 It is very easy to mess up the .0015" facing length.  Then you get into the
pattern of cutting down the table to get it back and messing it up again. 
I find it is best to leave the lengths short by 1-3 glass gage numbers
until you get the rest of the facing curve done.  Usually by the time I&#39;m
done, the facing length crept up close to target anyhow.
