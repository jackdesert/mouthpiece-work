            <pre class='message__body'>I own a vintage Brilhart 8* metal mouthpiece w/ a black plastic bite
plate on top. I believe it has been replaced or fooled with because it
was already pretty rough when I got it. Now it&#39;s in terrible shape as
there are two huge bite marks in it. It&#39;s a combination of me using it
and whomever had it before me. I have tried just slapping a mouthpiece
cusion on it and ignoring it, but the cushion won&#39;t stay put through
one practice session since the platic underneath is so eneven it won&#39;t
make proper contact. How easy would it be to remove the bite plate and
replace it? I&#39;m not very handy at all with things like this so I was
also wondering if anyone knew of anyone offering services to work on
damaged mouthpieces. Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>I just fixed one like you describe for another fellow. 

Replacement bite plates are just about nonexistant.  Supposedly Theo at 
Mouthpieceheaven.com has a few.

What I did for a customer, I filled the teeth grooves with a black epoxy 
(made for use on plumbing, and is safe for drinking water use), filed 
even, sanded smooth, polished, and finally, covered with a thin, clear 
patch.

Just curious, what is the black epoxy that you&#39;ve found. I&#39;ve used
marine epoxy in the past that I added acrylic colorant to...all also
advertised as food-safe, but have to mix a large volume to get the mix
right...

            <pre class='message__body'>You can find, in the plumbing supplies, the roll type epoxy putty, in 
black.  It is the same as the other putty epoxies, but black.

            <pre class='message__body'>The black stuff I use is the same but for color.  It has a different 
brand name, but is all black, inside and out. 

"QuickSteel" by CarGo.  #16002     May also be found in automotive 
department.

That fellow may have been me!  The mouthpiece looks great, feels much
