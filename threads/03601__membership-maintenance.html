            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m thinking about doing some purging of our membership if their Emails 
are bouncing.  Its my understanding that these are inactive addresses.  
I&#39;ll probably just do the ones that are several years old.

I think Yahoo tries a bunch of times to send to these addresses, then 
it deactivates them.  Then it sends several reactivation notices.  Then 
it gives up but does not remove the names from the membership listing I 
see.  It does generate a "Bouncing" report for me to look at.

Anyone have any insight to offer before I start messing with this?

If people can&#39;t keep their membership details up to date they can&#39;t be very 
interested. Clear our all the old paperwork!

Our service provider bounces Yahoo mail from time to time....
It&#39;s always for some unexplained reason.....
We have to reactivate with Yahoo several times a year.....

Yahoo as a rule does not consistantly retest bounced addresses.  It is also
VERY sensitive to any bounce.

On the lists I manage two or three retrys are manually sent before any
action is taken.  You do this from the Members/Bouncing/History (each one
has this) link.

A lot of people find dealing with the yahoo account interface troublesome,
so if I know the person and they are bouncing I will drop them a note (I had
been keeping a model message for this to cut & paste, but can I find it
now...?!)  from a non-Yahoo address, as sometimes their ISP simple is
blocking Yahoo (Yahoo is arrogant about meeting the technical requirements
that keep them from being blacklisted by services like SORBS, which is the
reference many ISP&#39;s use to bounce likely spam).

Drop me a note off list if I can be of further help!
