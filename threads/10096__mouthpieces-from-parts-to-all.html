Let&#39;s talk about important details of the Mouthpieces.

In the following graphs detail the places where they settle degrees of resistance and fluidity of the sound wave. What is your opinion that I probably know more about it?

First of all let me say that i am not an expert in the field of mouthpieces and my views are that of an observer

I am always fearful of destroying, or making a m/p play worse!!! - but then that is often how we learn.

The m/p is of course a very special shape, and all of the physical elements combine to make your instrument speak.

Would someone please exlain to me the design considerations of the very end of the m/p the tip edge.

If when sanding the curve too much material is removed the tip becomes a knife edge.  Is it then necessary to sand/file the edge to  put an edge of 1mm or so onto the tip end.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Silverio,
3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
All the best,

****

**I am not a physicist, but my take on what is going on inside the air column,
is that a when air enters and the reed closes off, a suction wave heads down
the tube until it reaches an open hole (not the register or octave key which
is too small) and disperses, sending a pressure wave back up the tube, which
opens the reed for another cycle. During the 'open reed' portion, the mouth
chamber also affects the overtones in the cycle. The length of the tube gives
the pitch because of the time it takes for the cycle to happen.**

**Maybe some more knowledgeable members can confirm/correct my understanding

Hi Silverio,
3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
All the best,

Dan

            <pre class='message__body'>While there is a jet of air entering the mouthpiece while the reed is open, that brief jet of moving air dissipates after about the first 1/2 inch, so, we can really forget about it after that.  What is important to realize is, the air moves relatively very little.  It is the resultant energy moving from air molecule to air molecule that makes the sound.  

In the saxophone (conical air columns) this high pressure energy pulse travels the length of the tube and reflects at the open end (or open tone hole) with an inversion - it becomes a low pressure pulse.  Other than the inversion, there is very little change to the shape of the pulse.  It travels back up the air column to the mouthpiece chamber, where the low pressure allows the reed to close (completely or close to it).  Due to the nature of conical air columns and the volume of the mouthpiece, there is a little delay before the pulse reflects at the reed, and it does so with another inversion.   It becomes a high pressure pulse again, and the reed opens, commencing a new cycle of the wave, reinforced by the new air jet&#39;s energy entering the mouthpiece.  

For the saxophone to work at all, the shape of the reflected pulse at the reed must closely resemble the shape of the energy pulse generated by the air jet entering the mouthpiece chamber.  It must arrive (from double tube transit) and reflect without significant distortion.  The closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer blowing the tone.  Add distortion, and the sound becomes weaker for the same amount of input energy.  We experience resistance.  Excessive distortion, and the reed will just stay closed.

So what mouthpiece characteristics cause distortion?  Wrong mouthpiece volume.  Wrong mouthpiece frequency.    Baffle shapes that generate pulses that are not sympathetic with the air column&#39;s resonance structure i.e., the air column can not conduct the pulse without distortion.  Any sharp edge or significant bore irregularity (e.g., a sharp window/ramp edge) will cause turbulence, which will create a distortion in the pulse.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m interested in Lance&#39;s assertion that the "shape" of the pulse is important. What is this shape? I&#39;ve never heard anything like this before. My understanding is the original "puff", as Benade calls it, becomes a wavefront which travels down the tube and back, as Lance says, to be reinforced by the next "puff" when it reaches the mpc tip. Since the reed is controlled by the air pressure in the tube, the timing can&#39;t help but be correct if the standing wave is created. The reed cycle is determined by the wave cycle (for the most part). 

What exactly, Lance, do you mean by "distortion"? What does it mean that the closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer-blowing the tone? It has always been my understanding that this is largely determined by the impedances of the tube, so how can the returning pulse, having traveled the length of the tube (whatever the impedance graph looks like) have a "shape" like the impulse coming from the reed tip? This explanation makes no sense to me. I had always thought we get stronger, freer-blowing tone when the impedances maxima of the tube are in close to harmonic ratios.

Benade states that baffle adjustments affect the tone by changing the way the reed moves when it is nearly closed--it has to do with Bernoulli forces which act on the reed as the space between reed and facing gets narrower. This kind of behavior has nothing to do with the returning pulse, rather it is aerodynamically determined by the pressure differential on the two sides of the reed and how it develops as the reed closes.

Research has shown that the oral cavity does act as an upstream resonator, but its main effects in controlling reed behavior are in special cases, such as pitch bending, bugling, and in the altissimo range. There appears to be very little effect in aligning resonances between the oral cavity and a significant frequency being played, at least according to research carried out at UNSW.

  Hello MartinMods, clear your explanation. Something is consistent with my drawings, apparently yes, if I understood there would be a backflow of air into, but not the sound? How important would then be the oral or buccal cavity of the player? as part of such molecular changes as I understand your writing.
  Thank you for participating

        While there is a jet of air entering the mouthpiece while the reed is open, that brief jet of moving air dissipates after about the first 1/2 inch, so, we can really forget about it after that.  What is important to realize is, the air moves relatively very little.  It is the resultant energy moving from air molecule to air molecule that makes the sound.  

        In the saxophone (conical air columns) this high pressure energy pulse travels the length of the tube and reflects at the open end (or open tone hole) with an inversion - it becomes a low pressure pulse.  Other than the inversion, there is very little change to the shape of the pulse.  It travels back up the air column to the mouthpiece chamber, where the low pressure allows the reed to close (completely or close to it).  Due to the nature of conical air columns and the volume of the mouthpiece, there is a little delay before the pulse reflects at the reed, and it does so with another inversion.   It becomes a high pressure pulse again, and the reed opens, commencing a new cycle of the wave, reinforced by the new air jet&#39;s energy entering the mouthpiece.  

        For the saxophone to work at all, the shape of the reflected pulse at the reed must closely resemble the shape of the energy pulse generated by the air jet entering the mouthpiece chamber.  It must arrive (from double tube transit) and reflect without significant distortion.  The closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer blowing the tone.  Add distortion, and the sound becomes weaker for the same amount of input energy.  We experience resistance.  Excessive distortion, and the reed will just stay closed.

        So what mouthpiece characteristics cause distortion?  Wrong mouthpiece volume.  Wrong mouthpiece frequency.    Baffle shapes that generate pulses that are not sympathetic with the air column&#39;s resonance structure i.e., the air column can not conduct the pulse without distortion.  Any sharp edge or significant bore irregularity (e.g., a sharp window/ramp edge) will cause turbulence, which will create a distortion in the pulse.

          Hi Dan, thanks for your observation. I just graphics or pictures to motivate those who have more precise information to clarify some information that goes through the web. Logically sound waves can not and should be represented by straight lines, but we must also address how fast these waves old, there is an implicit relationship between air flow and velocity of the incident on the movement of the rod, which transforms fluejo in the sound wave.

          Hi Silverio,
          3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
          All the best,

I have a question I will try to develop a "trial and error" coming soon. What if from the tip of the deflector or baffle with some micrometer channel along said tip begins to close (closer to the rod) from 1 cm from the tip, with an initial length from that cm from the tip to the end of the curve. Got it?

EXACTLY CORRECT!!!

The fact that the air goes into the bore of the instrument has nothing to do with the sound produced.  That is just a convenient place for the air to escape.  Look at the flute... very little air enters the bore, and most of the air escapes into the space in front of the player&#39;s face.  

Take horn speakers, for example... the horn is driven by a diaphragm, no air flow at all.

An aside, I have often heard supposed experts say that the flare on the end of the sax or various brass instruments is merely decorative.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The flare on the end of a horn, whether a trumpet or a PA system, functions as an acoustical transformer, coupling the soundwaves in the throat of the horn to the air around it.  No, the flare is not merely decorative, and it has nothing to do with air flow, either.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

Of course, any acoustician will tell you that trying to describe what is going on there in anything other than mathematics is senseless really, but for the layman, an incomplete picture of the actual reality is often more helpful than a completely inaccurate conception, derived from casual observation and common sense.  

To be useful, any reference to the transverse wave must include the dimension of time - (or position along the air column) and amplitude.  In the time domain that x/y graph gives us a definite shape.  Essentially, the Southbound transverse wave must be identical to the Northbound wave, only inverted.  It doesn&#39;t matter where you examine the resultant standing wave, at the reed, at some point in the neck, etc., any distortion in the Northbound wave, that isn&#39;t in the Southbound wave, will result in a weaker standing wave.

I posted this conical air column study in the MouthpieceWork2 files section some time ago.  It explains the concept: http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/QIdiTvPZDvF8f9G0dgvfi6U5rgukyogoLS5g-OE8KfSP6YoI3W9BWxtH753Q_r1V6uGojlhZaUoLPhMRs8g8VkhGWaMEGCTmpDBL/1985Ayers.pdf

      ﻿


I&#39;m interested in Lance&#39;s assertion that the 
"shape" of the pulse is important. What is this shape? I&#39;ve never heard anything 
like this before. My understanding is the original "puff", as Benade calls it, 
becomes a wavefront which travels down the tube and back, as Lance says, to be 
reinforced by the next "puff" when it reaches the mpc tip. Since the reed is 
controlled by the air pressure in the tube, the timing can&#39;t help but be correct 
if the standing wave is created. The reed cycle is determined by the wave cycle 
(for the most part). 
 
What exactly, Lance, do you mean by "distortion"? 
What does it mean that the closer the combining pulses are to identical, the 
stronger, freer-blowing the tone? It has always been my understanding that this 
is largely determined by the impedances of the tube, so how can the returning 
pulse, having traveled the length of the tube (whatever the impedance graph 
looks like) have a "shape" like the impulse coming from the reed tip? This 
explanation makes no sense to me. I had always thought we get stronger, 
freer-blowing tone when the impedances maxima of the tube are in close to 
harmonic ratios.
 
Benade states that baffle adjustments affect the 
tone by changing the way the reed moves when it is nearly closed--it has to do 
with Bernoulli forces which act on the reed as the space between reed and facing 
gets narrower. This kind of behavior has nothing to do with the returning pulse, 
rather it is aerodynamically determined by the pressure differential on the two 
sides of the reed and how it develops as the reed closes.
 
Research has shown that the oral cavity does act as 
an upstream resonator, but its main effects in controlling reed behavior are in 
special cases, such as pitch bending, bugling, and in the altissimo range. There 
appears to be very little effect in aligning resonances between the oral cavity 
and a significant frequency being played, at least according to research carried 
out at UNSW.

  Hello MartinMods, clear your explanation. Something is consistent with my 
  drawings, apparently yes, if I understood there would be a backflow of air 
  into, but not the sound? How important would then be the oral or buccal cavity 
  of the player? as part of such molecular changes as I understand your 
  writing.
Thank you for participating

      While there is a jet of air entering the mouthpiece while 
        the reed is open, that brief jet of moving air dissipates after about 
        the first 1/2 inch, so, we can really forget about it after that.  
        What is important to realize is, the air moves relatively very 
        little.  It is the resultant energy moving from air molecule to air 
        molecule that makes the sound.  

In the saxophone (conical 
        air columns) this high pressure energy pulse travels the length of the 
        tube and reflects at the open end (or open tone hole) with an inversion 
        - it becomes a low pressure pulse.  Other than the inversion, there 
        is very little change to the shape of the pulse.  It travels back 
        up the air column to the mouthpiece chamber, where the low pressure 
        allows the reed to close (completely or close to it).  Due to the 
        nature of conical air columns and the volume of the mouthpiece, there is 
        a little delay before the pulse reflects at the reed, and it does so 
        with another inversion.   It becomes a high pressure pulse 
        again, and the reed opens, commencing a new cycle of the wave, 
        reinforced by the new air jet&#39;s energy entering the mouthpiece.  
        

For the saxophone to work at all, the shape of the reflected 
        pulse at the reed must closely resemble the shape of the energy pulse 
        generated by the air jet entering the mouthpiece chamber.  It must 
        arrive (from double tube transit) and reflect without significant 
        distortion.  The closer the combining pulses are to identical, the 
        stronger, freer blowing the tone.  Add distortion, and the sound 
        becomes weaker for the same amount of input energy.  We experience 
        resistance.  Excessive distortion, and the reed will just stay 
        closed.

So what mouthpiece characteristics cause 
        distortion?  Wrong mouthpiece volume.  Wrong mouthpiece 
        frequency.    Baffle shapes that generate pulses that are not 
        sympathetic with the air column&#39;s resonance structure i.e., the air 
        column can not conduct the pulse without distortion.  Any sharp 
        edge or significant bore irregularity (e.g., a sharp window/ramp edge) 
        will cause turbulence, which will create a distortion in the 
        pulse.

          Hi Dan, thanks for your observation. I just graphics or pictures to 
          motivate those who have more precise information to clarify some 
          information that goes through the web. Logically sound waves can not 
          and should be represented by straight lines, but we must also address 
          how fast these waves old, there is an implicit relationship between 
          air flow and velocity of the incident on the movement of the rod, 
          which transforms fluejo in the sound wave. The higher the wave 
          velocity (ie in the acute) occurs most righteous of the wave. Or am I 
          wrong?
regards
Silverio

          Hi Silverio,
3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight 
          lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back 
          and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip 
          area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip 
          and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
All the 
          best,

Dan

            <pre class='message__body'>Agree. The bell is an impedance-matching device, there to improve the sound radiation from the last note, and to a lesser extent that of the next few higher notes. Notes above that have the sound radiated effectively from the open tone holes below them. The last note in particular has no open tone holes below it, and an abrupt cutoff would reflect high frequencies back into the horn, making the note very dull-sounding. The bell flare allows the high-frequencies to be radiated out instead of reflected back into the horn. I do believe, though, that it has some small effect on one or two of the next-lowest notes, but not much.

Other than the lowest note, the shape of the bell on a properly designed saxophone won&#39;t have a noticeable affect on how the low register speaks, responds, or feels to play.  



An aside, I have often heard supposed experts say that the flare on the end of the sax or various brass instruments is merely decorative.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The flare on the end of a horn, whether a trumpet or a PA system, functions as an acoustical transformer, coupling the soundwaves in the throat of the horn to the air around it.  No, the flare is not merely decorative, and it has nothing to do with air flow, either.

This can be proven on a clarinet by playing the low notes and removing and
replacing the bell.

      Very interesting development of your concepts Lance.
I have a question I will try to develop a "trial and error" coming soon. What if from the tip of the deflector or baffle with some micrometer channel along said tip begins to close (closer to the rod) from 1 cm from the tip, with an initial length from that cm from the tip to the end of the curve. Got it?

      ﻿


I&#39;m interested in Lance&#39;s assertion that the 
"shape" of the pulse is important. What is this shape? I&#39;ve never heard anything 
like this before. My understanding is the original "puff", as Benade calls it, 
becomes a wavefront which travels down the tube and back, as Lance says, to be 
reinforced by the next "puff" when it reaches the mpc tip. Since the reed is 
controlled by the air pressure in the tube, the timing can&#39;t help but be correct 
if the standing wave is created. The reed cycle is determined by the wave cycle 
(for the most part). 
 
What exactly, Lance, do you mean by "distortion"? 
What does it mean that the closer the combining pulses are to identical, the 
stronger, freer-blowing the tone? It has always been my understanding that this 
is largely determined by the impedances of the tube, so how can the returning 
pulse, having traveled the length of the tube (whatever the impedance graph 
looks like) have a "shape" like the impulse coming from the reed tip? This 
explanation makes no sense to me. I had always thought we get stronger, 
freer-blowing tone when the impedances maxima of the tube are in close to 
harmonic ratios.
 
Benade states that baffle adjustments affect the 
tone by changing the way the reed moves when it is nearly closed--it has to do 
with Bernoulli forces which act on the reed as the space between reed and facing 
gets narrower. This kind of behavior has nothing to do with the returning pulse, 
rather it is aerodynamically determined by the pressure differential on the two 
sides of the reed and how it develops as the reed closes.
 
Research has shown that the oral cavity does act as 
an upstream resonator, but its main effects in controlling reed behavior are in 
special cases, such as pitch bending, bugling, and in the altissimo range. There 
appears to be very little effect in aligning resonances between the oral cavity 
and a significant frequency being played, at least according to research carried 
out at UNSW.

  Hello MartinMods, clear your explanation. Something is consistent with my 
  drawings, apparently yes, if I understood there would be a backflow of air 
  into, but not the sound? How important would then be the oral or buccal cavity 
  of the player? as part of such molecular changes as I understand your 
  writing.
Thank you for participating

      While there is a jet of air entering the mouthpiece while 
        the reed is open, that brief jet of moving air dissipates after about 
        the first 1/2 inch, so, we can really forget about it after that.  
        What is important to realize is, the air moves relatively very 
        little.  It is the resultant energy moving from air molecule to air 
        molecule that makes the sound.  

In the saxophone (conical 
        air columns) this high pressure energy pulse travels the length of the 
        tube and reflects at the open end (or open tone hole) with an inversion 
        - it becomes a low pressure pulse.  Other than the inversion, there 
        is very little change to the shape of the pulse.  It travels back 
        up the air column to the mouthpiece chamber, where the low pressure 
        allows the reed to close (completely or close to it).  Due to the 
        nature of conical air columns and the volume of the mouthpiece, there is 
        a little delay before the pulse reflects at the reed, and it does so 
        with another inversion.   It becomes a high pressure pulse 
        again, and the reed opens, commencing a new cycle of the wave, 
        reinforced by the new air jet&#39;s energy entering the mouthpiece.  
        

For the saxophone to work at all, the shape of the reflected 
        pulse at the reed must closely resemble the shape of the energy pulse 
        generated by the air jet entering the mouthpiece chamber.  It must 
        arrive (from double tube transit) and reflect without significant 
        distortion.  The closer the combining pulses are to identical, the 
        stronger, freer blowing the tone.  Add distortion, and the sound 
        becomes weaker for the same amount of input energy.  We experience 
        resistance.  Excessive distortion, and the reed will just stay 
        closed.

So what mouthpiece characteristics cause 
        distortion?  Wrong mouthpiece volume.  Wrong mouthpiece 
        frequency.    Baffle shapes that generate pulses that are not 
        sympathetic with the air column&#39;s resonance structure i.e., the air 
        column can not conduct the pulse without distortion.  Any sharp 
        edge or significant bore irregularity (e.g., a sharp window/ramp edge) 
        will cause turbulence, which will create a distortion in the 
        pulse.

          Hi Dan, thanks for your observation. I just graphics or pictures to 
          motivate those who have more precise information to clarify some 
          information that goes through the web. Logically sound waves can not 
          and should be represented by straight lines, but we must also address 
          how fast these waves old, there is an implicit relationship between 
          air flow and velocity of the incident on the movement of the rod, 
          which transforms fluejo in the sound wave. The higher the wave 
          velocity (ie in the acute) occurs most righteous of the wave. Or am I 
          wrong?

          Hi Silverio,
3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight 
          lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back 
          and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip 
          area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip 
          and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
All the 
          best,

My understanding is the original "puff", as Benade calls it, becomes a wavefront which travels down the tube and back, as Lance says, to be reinforced by the next "puff" when it reaches the mpc tip. Since the reed is controlled by the air pressure in the tube, the timing can&#39;t help but be correct if the standing wave is created.

It has always been my understanding that this is largely determined by the impedances of the tube, so how can the returning pulse, having traveled the length of the tube (whatever the impedance graph looks like) have a "shape" like the impulse coming from the reed tip? This explanation makes no sense to me. I had always thought we get stronger, freer-blowing tone when the impedances maxima of the tube are in close to harmonic ratios.

I predict that the sound will be bright, edgy (gritty)  and a little choked off from the baffle being a little too high.  But the player is part of the system the results will depend on how they blow, as well as the facing and tip opening.

I can&#39;t imagine such a design being advantageous in any way. What&#39;s the thought behind the ugly bump?

Easy enough to test, though, with some chewing gum and a low-baffle piece...

            <pre class='message__body'>I doubt you will gain anything by actually having the area under the baffle decrease so drastically across the positive curve of the bump. I vote for a rather dull, choked, thin sound (very low baffle under the tip = dull, decrease in area further back = choked and thin). A reverse curve on the baffle will, I think, interfere with the coupling of the pressure impulse at the reed coupling with the air column, especially at higher dynamics.

I have a couple of tenor pieces that I could build up like that, but I won&#39;t have time until the weekend.

      This design is simple enough to test using some putty inside a mouthpiece.  
 
I predict that the sound will be bright, edgy (gritty)  and a little choked off from the baffle being a little too high.  But the player is part of the system the results will depend on how they blow, as well as the facing and tip opening.

I can&#39;t imagine such a design being advantageous in any way. What&#39;s the thought behind the ugly bump?

Easy enough to test, though, with some chewing gum and a low-baffle piece...

 Logically sound waves can not and should be represented by straight lines, but we must also address how fast these waves old, there is an implicit relationship between air flow and velocity of the incident on the movement of the rod, which transforms fluejo in the sound wave. The higher the wave velocity (ie in the acute) occurs most righteous of the wave. Or am I wrong?

Very interesting development of your concepts Lance.
I have a question I will try to develop a "trial and error" coming soon. What if from the tip of the deflector or baffle with some micrometer channel along said tip begins to close (closer to the rod) from 1 cm from the tip, with an initial length from that cm from the tip to the end of the curve. Got it?

﻿ 
I&#39;m interested in Lance&#39;s assertion that the "shape" of the pulse is important. What is this shape? I&#39;ve never heard anything like this before. My understanding is the original "puff", as Benade calls it, becomes a wavefront which travels down the tube and back, as Lance says, to be reinforced by the next "puff" when it reaches the mpc tip. Since the reed is controlled by the air pressure in the tube, the timing can&#39;t help but be correct if the standing wave is created. The reed cycle is determined by the wave cycle (for the most part). 
 
What exactly, Lance, do you mean by "distortion"? What does it mean that the closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer-blowing the tone? It has always been my understanding that this is largely determined by the impedances of the tube, so how can the returning pulse, having traveled the length of the tube (whatever the impedance graph looks like) have a "shape" like the impulse coming from the reed tip? This explanation makes no sense to me. I had always thought we get stronger, freer-blowing tone when the impedances maxima of the tube are in close to harmonic ratios.
 
Benade states that baffle adjustments affect the tone by changing the way the reed moves when it is nearly closed--it has to do with Bernoulli forces which act on the reed as the space between reed and facing gets narrower. This kind of behavior has nothing to do with the returning pulse, rather it is aerodynamically determined by the pressure differential on the two sides of the reed and how it develops as the reed closes.
 
Research has shown that the oral cavity does act as an upstream resonator, but its main effects in controlling reed behavior are in special cases, such as pitch bending, bugling, and in the altissimo range. There appears to be very little effect in aligning resonances between the oral cavity and a significant frequency being played, at least according to research carried out at UNSW.

While there is a jet of air entering the mouthpiece while the reed is open, that brief jet of moving air dissipates after about the first 1/2 inch, so, we can really forget about it after that.  What is important to realize is, the air moves relatively very little.  It is the resultant energy moving from air molecule to air molecule that makes the sound.  

In the saxophone (conical air columns) this high pressure energy pulse travels the length of the tube and reflects at the open end (or open tone hole) with an inversion - it becomes a low pressure pulse.  Other than the inversion, there is very little change to the shape of the pulse.  It travels back up the air column to the mouthpiece chamber, where the low pressure allows the reed to close (completely or close to it).  Due to the nature of conical air columns and the volume of the mouthpiece, there is a little delay before the pulse reflects at the reed, and it does so with another inversion.   It becomes a high pressure pulse again, and the reed opens, commencing a new cycle of the wave, reinforced by the new air jet&#39;s energy entering the mouthpiece.  

For the saxophone to work at all, the shape of the reflected pulse at the reed must closely resemble the shape of the energy pulse generated by the air jet entering the mouthpiece chamber.  It must arrive (from double tube transit) and reflect without significant distortion.  The closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer blowing the tone.  Add distortion, and the sound becomes weaker for the same amount of input energy.  We experience resistance.  Excessive distortion, and the reed will just stay closed.

So what mouthpiece characteristics cause distortion?  Wrong mouthpiece volume.  Wrong mouthpiece frequency.    Baffle shapes that generate pulses that are not sympathetic with the air column&#39;s resonance structure i.e., the air column can not conduct the pulse without distortion.  Any sharp edge or significant bore irregularity (e.g., a sharp window/ramp edge) will cause turbulence, which will create a distortion in the pulse.

Hi Silverio,
3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
All the best,

Hi Silverio,
I am lookong for a manufacturer to make my mew mouthpiece line.Do you have anyone there?

My understanding is the original "puff", as Benade calls it, becomes a wavefront which travels down the tube and back, as Lance says, to be reinforced by the next "puff" when it reaches the mpc tip. Since the reed is controlled by the air pressure in the tube, the timing can&#39;t help but be correct if the standing wave is created. The reed cycle is determined by the wave cycle (for the most part).

It has always been my understanding that this is largely determined by the impedances of the tube, so how can the returning pulse, having traveled the length of the tube (whatever the impedance graph looks like) have a "shape" like the impulse coming from the reed tip? This explanation makes no sense to me. I had always thought we get stronger, freer-blowing tone when the impedances maxima of the tube are in close to harmonic ratios.

            <pre class='message__body'>Silverio,

The reed tip and first 3/8" of the baffle already form a type of venturi, after which, the air jet dissipates.  At the location of your secondary venturi, we probably need only concern ourselves with the transverse pressure wave rather than a volume of moving air, and as such, this obstruction to the wave in both directions will probably function as a pretty good muffler baffle :-)

Very interesting development of your concepts Lance.
I have a question I will try to develop a "trial and error" coming soon. What if from the tip of the deflector or baffle with some micrometer channel along said tip begins to close (closer to the rod) from 1 cm from the tip, with an initial length from that cm from the tip to the end of the curve. Got it?

I&#39;m interested in Lance&#39;s assertion that the "shape" of the pulse is important. What is this shape? I&#39;ve never heard anything like this before. My understanding is the original "puff", as Benade calls it, becomes a wavefront which travels down the tube and back, as Lance says, to be reinforced by the next "puff" when it reaches the mpc tip. Since the reed is controlled by the air pressure in the tube, the timing can&#39;t help but be correct if the standing wave is created. The reed cycle is determined by the wave cycle (for the most part). 
 
What exactly, Lance, do you mean by "distortion"? What does it mean that the closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer-blowing the tone? It has always been my understanding that this is largely determined by the impedances of the tube, so how can the returning pulse, having traveled the length of the tube (whatever the impedance graph looks like) have a "shape" like the impulse coming from the reed tip? This explanation makes no sense to me. I had always thought we get stronger, freer-blowing tone when the impedances maxima of the tube are in close to harmonic ratios.
 
Benade states that baffle adjustments affect the tone by changing the way the reed moves when it is nearly closed--it has to do with Bernoulli forces which act on the reed as the space between reed and facing gets narrower. This kind of behavior has nothing to do with the returning pulse, rather it is aerodynamically determined by the pressure differential on the two sides of the reed and how it develops as the reed closes.
 
Research has shown that the oral cavity does act as an upstream resonator, but its main effects in controlling reed behavior are in special cases, such as pitch bending, bugling, and in the altissimo range. There appears to be very little effect in aligning resonances between the oral cavity and a significant frequency being played, at least according to research carried out at UNSW.

Hello MartinMods, clear your explanation. Something is consistent with my drawings, apparently yes, if I understood there would be a backflow of air into, but not the sound? How important would then be the oral or buccal cavity of the player? as part of such molecular changes as I understand your writing.
Thank you for participating

While there is a jet of air entering the mouthpiece while the reed is open, that brief jet of moving air dissipates after about the first 1/2 inch, so, we can really forget about it after that.  What is important to realize is, the air moves relatively very little.  It is the resultant energy moving from air molecule to air molecule that makes the sound.  

In the saxophone (conical air columns) this high pressure energy pulse travels the length of the tube and reflects at the open end (or open tone hole) with an inversion - it becomes a low pressure pulse.  Other than the inversion, there is very little change to the shape of the pulse.  It travels back up the air column to the mouthpiece chamber, where the low pressure allows the reed to close (completely or close to it).  Due to the nature of conical air columns and the volume of the mouthpiece, there is a little delay before the pulse reflects at the
 reed, and it does so with another inversion.   It becomes a high pressure pulse again, and the reed opens, commencing a new cycle of the wave, reinforced by the new air jet&#39;s energy entering the mouthpiece.  

For the saxophone to work at all, the shape of the reflected pulse at the reed must closely resemble the shape of the energy pulse generated by the air jet entering the mouthpiece chamber.  It must arrive (from double tube transit) and reflect without significant distortion.  The closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer blowing the tone.  Add distortion, and the sound becomes weaker for the same amount of input energy.  We experience resistance.  Excessive distortion, and the reed will just stay closed.

So what mouthpiece characteristics cause distortion?  Wrong mouthpiece volume.  Wrong mouthpiece frequency.    Baffle shapes that generate pulses that
 are not sympathetic with the air column&#39;s resonance structure i.e., the air column can not conduct the pulse without distortion.  Any sharp edge or significant bore irregularity (e.g., a sharp window/ramp edge) will cause turbulence, which will create a distortion in the pulse.

Hi Dan, thanks for your observation. I just graphics or pictures to motivate those who have more precise information to clarify some information that goes through the web. Logically sound waves can not and should be represented by straight lines, but we must also address how fast these waves old, there is an implicit relationship between air flow and velocity of the incident on the movement of the rod, which transforms fluejo in the sound wave. The higher the wave velocity (ie in the acute) occurs most righteous of the wave. Or am I wrong?

Hi Silverio,
3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
All the best,

Dan

Very interesting development of your concepts Lance. I have a question I will try to develop a "trial and error" coming soon. What if from the tip of the deflector or baffle with some micrometer channel along said tip begins to close (closer to the rod) from 1 cm from the tip, with an initial length from that cm from the tip to the end of the curve. Got it? regards Silverio

Silverio,

The reed tip and first 3/8" of the baffle already form a type of venturi, after which, the air jet dissipates.  At the location of your secondary venturi, we probably need only concern ourselves with the transverse pressure wave rather than a volume of moving air, and as such, this obstruction to the wave in both directions will probably function as a pretty good muffler baffle :-)

>>>>In the saxophone (conical air columns) this high pressure energy pulse travels the length of the tube and reflects at the open end (or open tone hole) with an inversion - it becomes a low pressure pulse.  Other than the inversion, there is very little change to the shape of the pulse.  It travels back up the air column to the mouthpiece chamber, where the low pressure allows the reed to close (completely or close to it).  Due to the nature of conical air columns and the volume of the mouthpiece, there is a little delay before the pulse reflects at the reed, and it does so with another inversion.   It becomes a high pressure pulse again, and the reed opens, commencing a new cycle of the wave, reinforced by the new air jet&#39;s energy entering the mouthpiece.

>>>>For the saxophone to work at all, the shape of the reflected pulse at the reed must closely resemble the shape of the energy pulse generated by the air jet entering the mouthpiece chamber.  It must arrive (from double tube transit) and reflect without significant distortion.  The closer the combining pulses are to identical, the stronger, freer blowing the tone.  Add distortion, and the sound becomes weaker for the same amount of input energy.  We experience resistance.  Excessive distortion, and the reed will just stay closed.

>>>>So what mouthpiece characteristics cause distortion?  Wrong mouthpiece volume.  Wrong mouthpiece frequency.    Baffle shapes that generate pulses that are not sympathetic with the air column&#39;s resonance structure i.e., the air column can not conduct the pulse without distortion.  Any sharp edge or significant bore irregularity (e.g., a sharp window/ramp edge) will cause turbulence, which will create a distortion in the pulse.

Logically sound waves can not and should be represented by straight lines, but we must also address how fast these waves old, there is an implicit relationship between air flow and velocity of the incident on the movement of the rod, which transforms fluejo in the sound wave. The higher the wave velocity (ie in the acute) occurs most righteous of the wave. Or am I wrong? regards Silverio

>>>>>Hi Silverio, 3D sound waves cannot be represented using straight lines. Well... at least they should not. There is nothing jumping back and forth inside a mouthpiece. You have an airflow just near the tip area, that&#39;s all. Pay as much attention you can to optimize the tip and baffle area. Good rails will do the rest.
