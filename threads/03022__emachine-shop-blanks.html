            <pre class='message__body'>These are excellent.

Cost about $20 each.

Facing was machined, appx .090" tip opening.

I did the facing first, opening to .0104" with 23 mm facing length.

Then I worked the baffle taking off from the tip rail on back to the 
rear of the raised baffle.  There was, by design, an excess of baffle 
material to work with.

I have the first of the three I bought playing pretty well.

Since you have just joined us 2/22/05, there is a lot of stuff in the 
message archives you probably have not heard of yet.

Like Paul said, the cost at the time was $20 + s/h.    A similar 
quantity would cost more now.  The rough facing and all the other 
surfaces were cut on a 3-axis mill.  There are pictures of the blank 
on the MPWork Site&#39;s home page and in the Photos section unde CAD.
