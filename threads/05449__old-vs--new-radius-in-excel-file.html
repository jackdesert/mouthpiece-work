            <pre class='message__body'>Ive been noticing that many of the "older" mouthpieces I have been
measuring and play testing seem to have been originally faced with a
radius between 5.3 and 5.9 when I put the numbers into the excel
spreadsheet.  However, I have gotten my hands on about 2 dozen new
alto Meyers and Tenor Links, and while measuring them these past few
weeks I have noticed that their facing curves produce a radius of
around 4.5 on average.  In addition, they all have very short lengths
given their tip openings: ex. length 31, tip opening .067 on one
Meyer.  Now I know that the quality of facing coming from Babbitt isnt
always the greatest, but I have fixed two of these Meyer&#39;s now and
both play so much better that I have had students buy them off me
already.  So, my question is, does anyone know the reason behind these
flatter curves and shorter facings?    Has anyone worked for Babbitt
and know what the thinking is behind these measurements that create
stuffier and less playable mouthpieces?  It is possible that my sample
of a dozen Meyer 5M altos and a dozen Link 6* Tenors is too small? 
Any thoughts?

Unforunately your question extends into quality control issues with 
many companies that mass produce fast and cheaply made products. The 
primary focus of concern with too many businesses is PROFIT not quality 
or bang for your buck. Resin and plastic mouthpieces????????????

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, thanks for the reply.  It actually helps add some clarity to my scrambled thinking, so let me ask the question in a different way.  I took a new stock Meyer 5M and put the "vintage" 5M facing on it.  Now, knowing that the new Meyer&#39;s do not have the same chamber and baffle shapes as the old, I still refaced it and was able to gain an actual jazz alto sound out of it.  So, I guess my question is: what are some of the factors that companies like Babbitt take into consideration when designing these facings?  They obviously do not play or sound nearly as good as tried and true facings of the past.  Even the Limited Edition New York Meyer that was put out a few years ago was supposed to have the same facing as the classic 5M, but upon measuring one this morning, it wasnt close!  As Steve pointed out, the initial manufacturing could not have a huge cost increase to alter the basic facing.  The finishing work done could increase costs significantly, but it seems that if my
 number crunching is correct, these mouthpieces do not start with a viable facing, therefore leaving the finish work no chance of making the mouthpiece play great.  Is that a fair assumption or am I missing something?

            <pre class='message__body'>The technology is there today to machine cut facings with an incredible
degree of accuracy. The technology doesn&#39;t come cheap. Quality control and
hand "touch ups" don&#39;t come cheap, either. A few USA companies (that I will
not name) are still using some pretty old equipment and molds, and as a
result of plain old ordinary wear, tolerances are less than they should be.
There&#39;s plenty of products out there today that show conclusively that it
can be done correctly. It just takes a commitment to quality control on the
part of the maker.

On our three lines of mouthpieces, we use three different levels of
tolerances, all dictated by manufacturing cost. You can&#39;t afford to do a
great deal of fine tuning on a $100 mouthpiece. That&#39;s reality. It&#39;s really
a case of you get what you pay for.

            <pre class='message__body'>The calculated radius in the excel spreadsheet is a function of the 
tip opening AND the facing length. As you noted, some of the facing 
lengths are shorter. If I am not mistaken the facing length is 
directly proportional to the radius of the circle, since you need a 
larger circle to get a longer facing length.  Given the same tip 
opening, on two mouthpieces, the longer faced mouthpiece will have a 
larger radius in the excel spreadsheet.

So, if you have vintage mouthpiece at a given length and a given tip 
opening, you will have a certain radius.  If after some testing or 
some trend, the manufacturer determines newer versions of the 
mouthpiece sounds or responds better at a different facing length you 
will have a different radius.

Varying the facing length and the tip opening allows for some 
experimenting. Changing each does change the character of the sound 
produced and the response of the mouthpiece. If you follow the school 
that a radical curve works for you, then as long as the points you 
take and measure are on a radical curve then things are good.  It is 
not to say that the new radius you are measuring is wrong, it is just 
different from the vintage one you have, and will not respond like 
the vintage one.

I&#39;ve sorta modified the excel spreadsheet in the files area so that I 
feed it a tip opening and a facing length.  I use the solve equation 
function in excel to generate a theoretical perfect radical curve for 
the given length and opening.  This works pretty well for 
experimenting with opening a mouthpiece or varying the length.
