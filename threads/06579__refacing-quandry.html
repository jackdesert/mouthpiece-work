            <pre class='message__body'>I have an old vintage piece that is too small of an opening.  I know I 
can open it from the back.  The problem is that its original 
construction left a fairly thin tip so there really isnt much room for 
error.  Any ideas on how to go about opeing the piece (reangling) the 
table when I dont have much to work with in front...and of course 
having a good facing curve when its done??

thanks

I think we have to accept sometimes, that some mouthpieces would only  
go so far. On the other hand, as you know, you can have great soounding 
pieces , that are not as open. Play them with a 3 1/2- 4 size reed, and 
they can really scream.......provinding the curve is apropriatefor the 
oppening and well executed.

.....that&#39;s just a humble opinion.
Cheers !

>I feel that if I don&#39;t like the way a piece plays I tear into it.If 
that means I have to shorten the tip to make it thicker then thats 
what I do.I do a lot of play testing along the way and when I get it 
to play the way want I stop.If everything doesn&#39;t measure perfect I 
don&#39;t care as long as it plays 
great.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sigmund, trying to open the tip by cutting down the shank end of the 
table results in a longer facing.  Or a very odd shaped facing.

Spend some time with graph paper, ruler, compass, and see what happens 
when you do this.

In fact, anyone that wants to do any refacing, this is a good idea.
