I think we have to accept sometimes, that some mouthpieces would only  
go so far. On the other hand, as you know, you can have great soounding 
pieces , that are not as open. Play them with a 3 1/2- 4 size reed, and 
they can really scream.......provinding the curve is apropriatefor the 
oppening and well executed.

.....that&#39;s just a humble opinion.
Cheers !

            <pre class='message__body'>Sigmund, trying to open the tip by cutting down the shank end of the 
table results in a longer facing.  Or a very odd shaped facing.

Spend some time with graph paper, ruler, compass, and see what happens 
when you do this.

In fact, anyone that wants to do any refacing, this is a good idea.
