This was one of those.  
And it wasn't a simple concavity (like all the Links I've seen), but was an
odd "terrain" of high spots and low spots, which is why I needed to flatten it
so much. One of the rails, at the point near the back of the window, had a
section that wasn't contacting the sandpaper until I had taken lots of
material off the rest of the table. Also, one of the corners at the butt end
had a severe drop-off (since the table isn't as long as a reed, I had to
address that issue as well).

machining a flat table would be one of the least difficult things they could

But this is a mouthpiece that cost $250 the last time I looked (a few years
ago) and was claimed to be hand finished by Peter Ponzol.

New stock, or older piece?

The amount of chamber volume lost should not be significant.  You would
just pull out a little to compensate.  Like 1/32"-1/16".  But maybe you
took a lot off the table.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I think if I had figured out the "terrain" of the table early on and adjusted
my 'lean' on the mouthpiece while flattening, I could have gotten to a flat

until it was good. The metal seemed unusually hard, also, BTW.

response for my tastes.  

I agree with Paul that you will improve the intonation and response of 
the mouthpiece by filing down the edge of the step baffle into about a 
22 degree angle so it looks like the Guardala piece. Then it will be a 
shorter step baffle with a ramp that leads to the chamber floor.

Hello Greg, 

I am curious whether you have modified a Ponzol M1 in the fashion you 
describe, and have gotten the results you predict here.

My own experiments with chambers and baffles suggests to me that an 
extended step baffle as seen in the M1 makes a piece brighter and somewhat 
more responsive - but at the cost of losing some of the fullness of the lower 
register. The added material certainly doesn&#39;t "weigh the piece down", unless 
you refer to its actual weight, which has little to do with its sound.

What the step baffle does, IMHO, is increase air velocity by narrowing the 
passage, which improves the output of the piece by heightening the bernoulli 
effect along the underside of the reed. The step may create air turbulence that 
further increases air velocity along the reed near the base of the vamp. I think 
that filing down the step baffle will decrease the air velocity under the reed 
towards the base of the vamp - and the mouthpiece may feel less responsive, 
not more - although, as previously noted, the low register may be a bit fuller.

This is my observation based on creating many different baffle inserts of 
varying lengths, heights, and shapes for a number of different mouthpieces. 

Taking off reed material at the base of the vamp improves the lower register 
response. My thought is that whether one increases air velocity under the 
base of the vamp or takes off material here,  either way, the lower register is 
somewhat facilitated.

On my own Ponzol M1, I made a custom baffle insert that adds about 1/8 inch 
to the step. I find this improves the responsiveness of the piece to my tastes - 
it&#39;s brighter and projects better; and is a little less demanding of air in the 
bottom register.  To take the baffle down as you suggest likely would have an 
opposite effect.

That said, the Ponzol in question may have had a significant amount of the 
facing removed. This has brought the baffle closer to the reed, and made the 
mouthpiece a bit brighter already. For a darker sound, taking material from the 
baffle as you suggest might be desirable.

Barry
