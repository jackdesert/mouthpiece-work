Maybe I&#39;m thinking too far ahead but it seems, at least to me, that it would 
be very interesting to see what type of pieces we all end up with starting 
with virtually the same exact blanks. I&#39;m just wondering if their is a way 
for a bunch of us to get together and compare work after the dust settles.
