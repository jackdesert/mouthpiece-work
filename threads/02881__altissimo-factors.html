Has anyone had problems getting altissimo response with a "rollover"
baffle design?

            <pre class='message__body'>I can not speak for everyone, but I have had altissimo response problems
with roll-over baffles.  I think the tone is thin with high roll-overs.

It a facing curve flattens out to much at the tip, altissimo response will
be poor in my experiance.  There is no place for the very tip of the reed
to vibrate for those high frequencies.

Could you describe your definition of rollover?

            <pre class='message__body'>My experience is the same. I find a sharp angle just behind the tip rail is best for altissimo, even if the baffle is generally high.

Anyway that&#39;s me.
