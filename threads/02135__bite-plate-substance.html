I&#39;ve built up an old metal Brilhart Levelair using epoxy putty and it 
actually feels great with a thin tooth cushion stuck on it - but it 
is a bit hard (and maybe abrasive?) for having your teeth directly on 
it.  I&#39;m pretty happy with it like that and it makes me wonder why 
metal mouthpieces even need a bite plate when you could just use one

            <pre class='message__body'>In a nutshell: most epoxies contain plasticizers that are also hormone disrupters, such as Bisphenol A. There is a lot of controversy surrounding the whole question, with industry claiming they are safe (after all many food tins are lined with epoxy) and watchdog and consumer groups claiming they are not. The science can be read both ways: nothing conclusive but some definite warning signals. 

Baffles are one thing, since you usually do not come into oral contact with them unless you suck a lot of spit, but bite plates are quite another, as chems can leach out of the epoxy and into your mouth.

Stephen Howard contacted the makers of JB Weld, who used to say that their product was inert after it set, to ask about oral contact. They say that it is not recommended, although there are no specific warnings.

FYI dentist&#39;s epoxies and tooth sealants also contain Bisphenol and are under scrutiny...

FWIW,

Mike, there&#39;s a lot of stuff you can use but I use Serfcote. Same 
stuff
Dukoff and Wolf Tayne uses. Phil 
&lt;&lt;&lt;

I did a search and could not find "Serfcote" anywhere... but I did 
find "Surfcoat" a floor covering that might be the stuff.  There is a 
link to a site that has it in the Links - Tools and Materials section.

I have not tried it since it does not seem to be available in small 
quantities, only 5 gallon buckets.

I&#39;ve been happy enough with the 2-part black Acrylic I purchased from 
McMaster-Carr.
