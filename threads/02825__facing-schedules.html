Well, most tools are ordered and being sought out.  Is there a sourse 
with contemporary tenor facing schedules...ie meyers, otto links, RPC 
etc.  The ones in the brand are a place to start but what about 
measures on larger tips?

Well, most tools are ordered and being sought out.  Is there a sourse 
with contemporary tenor facing schedules...ie meyers, otto links, RPC 
etc.  The ones in the brand are a place to start but what about 
measures on larger tips?

See message post 2659 for some general guidelines posted by Adam 
Niewood.  The main problem with these guidelines are that they stop 
at the .050" feeler.  Like for a .110" tip, the curve is not defined 
between .050" to .110".  This is more than half the curve.

You also can clone the facings of your favorite mouthpieces.  
Unfortunately, you clone the defects in the curve too.  But if the 
original plays good, you wont be too far off.

If you know your way around spreadsheets, I have posted several in 
the Files area that will help you make your own facing schedules.  I 
use spreadsheet generated curves for all my work.  I find they yeild 
better results than using numbers from measurements or other sources.

The E. Brand facings should be used with caution.  They were probably 
developed from measuring a limited sample of each mouthpiece (like 
one).  I have plotted a few of them against my measurements of 
pristine condition vintage Woodwind brand mouthpieces.  They can 
differ a lot.  So there is a lot of manufacturing variation or some 
other reason for the difference.  Plus, my measurements, and Brand&#39;s, 
showed flat spots and bumps in the facing curves that I think are 
more "defects" than "features" worth cloning.

Plotting facing curves gives you a blown up visual picture of what 
the curve looks like.  The computer age gives us a huge advantage 
over the old methods of just using tables of numbers.
