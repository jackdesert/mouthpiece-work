            <pre class='message__body'>VERY GOOD, Paul, I agree, practice and explain it to students and, yes,  even 
experienced players. Playing several [fragile} glass, as well as HR  mps,  
the safety implications are foremost. Yes, I too remove reed and  lig, and 
holding the mp lower portion, assemble, greasing corks as  needed. Glad to see 
these comments.  Don
