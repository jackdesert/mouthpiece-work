            <pre class='message__body'>Hi All,  I saw that Ferree&#39;s has a mouthpiece "refacing kit" available
for around $200.  Has anyone purchased this kit?  Is it worth the
money, or would it be more economical to start obtaining
tools/materials from various sources?  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Marco

It is more economical to build your own starter kit, but it is more tedious
and you need to dig for beginner&#39;s instructions.  But that is what the
Yahoo MPWork site is all about.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

 

I am Gustavo from Austria.

Now is when things start to really get interesting.

 

Could any of you define what a started kit is, how to build one and also
some beginners instructions?

If this was already part of the forum discussion topics (as I guess it was)
please give me a hint where to look for the email stream.

 

Thanks,

Gustavo

            <pre class='message__body'>There are some hints right on the home page of the MouthpieceWork Yahoo
site.  There are some good lists in the Files - Methods area so you do not
have to sift through all the old posts to find them.
