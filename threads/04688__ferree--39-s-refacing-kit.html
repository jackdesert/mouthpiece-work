It is more economical to build your own starter kit, but it is more tedious
and you need to dig for beginner&#39;s instructions.  But that is what the
Yahoo MPWork site is all about.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

 

I am Gustavo from Austria.

Now is when things start to really get interesting.

 

Could any of you define what a started kit is, how to build one and also
some beginners instructions?

If this was already part of the forum discussion topics (as I guess it was)
please give me a hint where to look for the email stream.

 

Thanks,

Gustavo

Someone on SOTW posted that Ralph Morgan sent 40 kits to Ferree&#39;s for them
to sell.
