            <pre class='message__body'>I acquired an older Vandoren bari mpce, 3 for and older Buescher 400 
bari, and I own a Vandoren tenor S9,tip opening .109"-Keith B. just re-
did this piece and did a great job. 
 My question is in doing a refacing and opening the tip of this bari 
pce to the same as the tenor,
what criteria do you use for deciding whether to either back cut from  
the table or just 
going at the curve as is to get more opening? I realize if there isn&#39;t 
enough tip that you might also be &#39;shortening&#39; the peice and reducing 
the chamber volume somewhat, and this would probably be undesirable, 
thus backcutting, but this pce does have a lot of meat at the tip. 
Also relative to comparing bari to tenor pces, would it be ok to 
basically transpose the arc and length of the facing curve from the 
tenor VanD to the Bari VanD? In other words is it feasible to assume 
they 
would play/feel the same relative to reed control etc. The VanD bari 
pce 
doesn&#39;t have any discernable rollover which is something I would like 
to put into it. The tip is in rough shape but the rest of the chamber 
seems relatively similar to the tenor. Any responses would be welcomed.

            <pre class='message__body'>The only advocate I know of angling a table to open a tip is Doc Tenney. 
It is a lot of work and is generally limited to opening a piece by one
size, like .005" to .010".  It is easier to cut the tip and I find I get
better results by reshaping the baffle and making it a little higher with
the new tip opening.  

Many players like to play a bari tip opening that is up to .020" larger
than their tenor mouthpiece.  But some like them about the same tip
opening.  I&#39;m one of them.  So I think the facing curve I put on your
Vandoren tenor would be an excellent curve for your bari MP too.

BTW, I just sent it back to you recently and it is now a .111" tip after
reworking the tip rail as you wished.

            <pre class='message__body'>Whoops Fred, I had you confused with another client.  I do not have a
record of you having a .109" piece from me.  The S9 tenor should be .120",
yes?  It the .109" a Berg or something I missed recording info on?

            <pre class='message__body'>OOPS,your right Keith, the tenor VanD pce you did for me is .120", don&#39;t know where .109" came from? 
I guess I mentioned cutting from the table because the Bari pce is around .075" in it&#39;s present state. That would be a difference .045", a fair bit of mat&#39;l to remove.
Thanks for your input.
fred
