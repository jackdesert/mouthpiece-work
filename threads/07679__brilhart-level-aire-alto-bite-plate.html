Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Brilhart Level Aire Alto Bite Plate

  
Does anybody know where I can get a replacement bite plate (the big clunky kind) for a 70&#39;s era Level Aire alto sax mouthpiece?  I know they don&#39;t make them anymore and I have a hard rubber clarinet barrel that I think can be hacked up into the right size to fit and then I&#39;d finish it.  It sure would be easier if somebody knows of a better replacement though!  Any thoughts?
Thanks in advance,
Craig

Get a cheap alto sax mouthpiece and cut off everything that doesn&#39;t look like the biteplate you need.  Seriously, I&#39;ve done this more than a few times.

If you need one, I&#39;ve got some good alto blanks for a few bucks a piece.
