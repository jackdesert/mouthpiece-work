Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Brilhart Level Aire Alto Bite Plate

  
Does anybody know where I can get a replacement bite plate (the big clunky kind) for a 70&#39;s era Level Aire alto sax mouthpiece?  I know they don&#39;t make them anymore and I have a hard rubber clarinet barrel that I think can be hacked up into the right size to fit and then I&#39;d finish it.  It sure would be easier if somebody knows of a better replacement though!  Any thoughts?
Thanks in advance,
Craig

Get a cheap alto sax mouthpiece and cut off everything that doesn&#39;t look like the biteplate you need.  Seriously, I&#39;ve done this more than a few times.

If you need one, I&#39;ve got some good alto blanks for a few bucks a piece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Do it in white - cut up some PVC pipe.  If you don&#39;t feel like buying 8&#39; of
pipe (lifetime supply), you could use the special piece for joining lengths.

Hi Craig
You can get them at JJ babbitt,, just call them and they will send them to you. If they only have Tenor you can easily shape them for alto .. I Know , I have several level airs, and have repalced all the biteplates
Good Luck
