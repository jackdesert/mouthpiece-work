            <pre class='message__body'>I wrote on the SOTW forum:
"Phil Barone has some posts, but has not told us all he knows."

Sorry Phil, you and others may have read more into this than I had 
intended.  I think you will agree it is a factual statement.  

I did not want SOTW readers to come rushing over here expecting this 
forum to be a Phil Barone handbook.  I am grateful for your 
participation.
