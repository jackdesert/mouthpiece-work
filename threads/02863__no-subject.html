            <pre class='message__body'>I use a coarse 1/2" dia sanding drum on a rotary tool.  This allows you to
enlarge straight and tapered bores.

I have not developed specific targets for each sax bore.  I handle each one
individually.  If a client does not complain, I do not touch it.  You never
know what kind of neck cork they have.

Tenor bores typically run from .655" to .688".  the average is probably in
the .665"-.675" range.
