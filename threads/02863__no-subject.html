            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, I made a command decision and sold it on Ebay (It went in 20 minutes) before it went the way of the other clean pieces I attempted to improve. The Brilhart was to good for me to touch. Before I do any more w/ mouthpieces I&#39;ll have to get some tools and more knowledge and of course inexpensive junk to learn on. One more question. What&#39;s the best way to bore out a tenor (Berg Larson) hard rubber mouthpiece and what should be the "standard" diameter. My Guardala is about .660 of an inch. Thanks, Doug...

Dug,
Take it to COZ woodwinds, he&#39;ll take a large hammer and chisel to 
it, it will fit like a glove.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a coarse 1/2" dia sanding drum on a rotary tool.  This allows you to
enlarge straight and tapered bores.

I have not developed specific targets for each sax bore.  I handle each one
individually.  If a client does not complain, I do not touch it.  You never
know what kind of neck cork they have.

Tenor bores typically run from .655" to .688".  the average is probably in
the .665"-.675" range.

            <pre class='message__body'>Is this a "*" facing?  (4*, 5*, etc).  The * facings are very short and 
difficult in the low register.  Lengthen the facing and they are quite nice.
