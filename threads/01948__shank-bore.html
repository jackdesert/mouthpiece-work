            <pre class='message__body'>Several questions:
- Awhile ago there was a post somewhere asking folks to post the 
shank bore diameters that they have found in &#39;stock&#39; pieces...e.g. I 
have found that tenor pieces vary from 16.7mm up to about 17.1mm and 
bari pieces seem to vary from about 17.4 up to about 18.1 mm. A given 
cork setup can accommodate a range of about .2 mm without shimming 
(teflon tape) or excessive compression, although &lt;0.1 is better. Any 
comments about what is a &#39;most common&#39; or &#39;standard&#39; diameter

- Any thoughts on tools for creating a clean, round bore for 1) 
enlarging an existing one or 2) reboring a shank that has been faired 
with some acrylic or epoxy? I have looked at the Abtex flexible hones 
with some relish when my fingers were raw from sanding an ID by hand.

similar tools?)

            <pre class='message__body'>I have only used sanding drums with my rotary tool on a flex shaft.

You might look in to machinist&#39;s reamers.  I have not tried one yet.

I have a lot of measurements of bores but I need to summarize them.  Some
of them are from tapered bores and some are not.  But I did not try to
record the taper.

            <pre class='message__body'>Amazing...can you actually control the removal on a HR piece to, say, 
open a piece by 0.1-0.2 mm? I don&#39;t have a handpiece, so I&#39;m handling 
the whole tool....I didn&#39;t imagine that I could keep it straight, so 
I still burn fingers. These Abtex hones lookes interesting...can you 
fit a standard Jacobs chuck to your handpiece to use these 
delicately. I was thinking that I might chuck them in a drill press, 
run it at, say 250-300 RPM and handle the mouthpiece, while using a 
foot control to turn the reamer on and off.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use an old Weller roatary tool with a flex shaft and a variable speed
foot pedal.  I have several sizes of sanding drums.  I use the largest that
will fit in the shank.  I just keep sweeping it around the bore.  I track
progress with calipers.  It does not remove HR material as fast as you
would think.  It takes a few minutes to remove .003".  I have to keep
cleaning away the dust to make progress.  If calipers show that the bore is
not round, I find it pretty easy to direct the tool to widen up the tight spots.
