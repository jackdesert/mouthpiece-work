I forget to say the original idea was from one of the best italian

He fabricated a similar device some time ago and gave me the idea.
Thanks again Claudio,

            <pre class='message__body'>The path is "Photos" -> "Sanding".
Choose the "show all" option if you don&#39;t see the "sanding" folder.
