            <pre class='message__body'>hello to all,
I have a Tenor metal Meyer 8M (It is made in three parts (shank, center and part with facing) soldered together!!!!)
Someone has opened up its tip at .105 (like a Meyer jazz metal 8) with 22 mm facing length.
questions:
which is the differences in baffle/chamber between Meyer Metal and Meyer Metal jazz?
someone has the facing length for Metal 9 (.104) and Metal Jazz 8 (.105)?
thanks in advance e ciao a tutti
Filippo</pre>
