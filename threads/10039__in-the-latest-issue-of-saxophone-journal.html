You&#39;ll find the first of my two part article about my good friend,  
master engraver Jason DuMars. It&#39;s fascinating stuff, and there was so  
much information we had to spread it over two issues.....I write an  
article about some aspect of saxophone design for EVERY issue, and  
have for years......

I would be very remiss if I didn&#39;t mention that beginning with this  
issue, my long time associate (and former student) Curt Altarac takes  
over writing the repair column, and if his first article is any  
indication, you can expect to learn a lot!

The September issue should be on news stands this week. There are also  
great articles by Andrew Clark, David Pope, David Dempsey, Greg  
Banaszak, Skip Spratt and others. If you&#39;re not regularly reading the
