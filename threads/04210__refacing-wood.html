            <pre class='message__body'>I have a wooden tenor mouthpiece to reface - very crooked table and some 
side/tip rail damage.  I was planning on starting with the fine 
mylar-backed adhesive sandpaper (15 microns or .15 or 1.5, whatever it 
is), and if it needs anything coarser, going to 1000-grit sandpaper, and 
just going very slowly until I get a feel for the material.

Any tips/advice on refacing wood?  Any care, like oiling, that would be 
beneficial?  Thanks again, guys.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve never refaced a wooden mpc, but I&#39;ve done a lot of fine work on wood, and I&#39;d say you&#39;ll find it similar to standard ebonite--hard rubber--in terms of hardness and workability, perhaps even a touch harder. I&#39;d say that you could start with 800 for the table if it really needs a lot of work, but 1200 is certainly safer for the rails. 2000 would be best for your general finishing work, but it clogs up fast so you probably don&#39;t want to start with that. Here in Japan I&#39;ve found 10000 (even 30000!) which is nice for a final pass to really get the sanded surfaces shining.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have found wood mouthpieces to be fairly hard.  Similar to hard rubber. 
They vary, but so does hard rubber.  You will not get very far using just
fine sandpapers.  But you can start that way and switch to a coarser paper
if you are not making enough progress.

            <pre class='message__body'>Great.  Obviously I was just concerned that it might be significantly 
softer than HR.

Any treatment like oiling that they need?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have never oiled one.  I suppose you should treat them as you do wood
clarinets.

            <pre class='message__body'>I can&#39;t imagine that oiling them would hurt, but it probably won&#39;t help much either. There was a study done not long ago that showed that bore oil doesn&#39;t penetrate hard woods like grenadilla and cocuswood to any significant extent, but it might provide some very superficial protection.

Have you got a pointer to the study?
