I&#39;d say that you could start with 800 for the table if it really needs a lot of work, but 1200 is certainly safer for the rails. 2000 would be best for your general finishing work, but it clogs up fast so you probably don&#39;t want to start with that. Here in Japan I&#39;ve found 10000 (even 30000!) which is nice for a final pass to really get the sanded surfaces shining.

They vary, but so does hard rubber.  You will not get very far using just
fine sandpapers.  But you can start that way and switch to a coarser paper
if you are not making enough progress.
