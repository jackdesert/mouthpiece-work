            <pre class='message__body'>Hey, guys...

Whatever you do, please don&#39;t use any offensive language (etc) here. 
I tried to see the jokes page on the SOTW forum, and it got blocked 
by the "net nanny" on my work&#39;s computer system (my only internet 
access). It said that the site was blocked because of "offensive 
language". As a result, I can no longer acceess the SOTW forum (not 
any part of it - all gone)... All because someone decided to use an 
off-colour word that the net-nanny recognised...

:-(    :-(    :-(     :-(     :-(

Whatever you do, please don&#39;t put any "offensive" words in any of 
your posts here, or I won&#39;t be able to access this or any of the 
other Yahoo groups that I&#39;m on (two of which I&#39;m a moderator of - I 
can&#39;t afford to lose access to these groups). It would be a total 
disaster for me if that were to happen! TIA.

Danny

I do not think you can effectively be a moderator through a site blocker
that you have no control over.  How are you going to clean up a site you
are moderating if you are blocked from seeing it?  You can consider a modem
and a dial-up account to go around the site blocker.  Or you can get access
at home?

My work site blocker was blocking anything with triple X&#39;s.  Some sax sites
I was trying to see had listed sax serial numbers as 234,...triple X.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,
Thanks for the reply. I just thought I would let the guys know what 
is happening with some of us (saxophone stuff helps to keep me sAnE). 
I agree with your comments.

Currently I&#39;m not happy with my job because of "people issues" - a 
corporate version of "Adolph H!+ler" (the net nanny could possibly 
block the "H" word for all I know) trying to make me look 
incompetent. Of course, this is while I&#39;m left with no choice but to 
do things that his subordinates should be doing, on top of my own 
work (he perceives me to be a threat to his career objectives). So 
I&#39;ve started applying for other jobs, so *hopefully* I&#39;ll end up 
somewhere that doesn&#39;t have such a nasty net nanny (not to mention 
the people) some time very soon...
:-)

Besides, I&#39;m applying for jobs that would equate to a promotion (and 
it&#39;s about time I had one of those...), so I should end up with a bit 
more money to support my "Gear Acquisition Syndrome"...
;-)

Thanks again.

Danny
