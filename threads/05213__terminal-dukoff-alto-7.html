            <pre class='message__body'>I have this mpc and the tip is almost gone, it&#39;s been worked on to the 
point of there being about 3/16" of material left at the center of the 
tip and even less at the corners b4 the bite patch. It&#39;s thin enough in 
this area to bend without much effort. 
Anyone added workable material to a silverite mpc with any success or 
is this mpc done? 
If there is mat&#39;l that would work what is it and will it adhere to the 
silverite?
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

            <pre class='message__body'>It is probably shot.  I&#39;d pick up a used one off eBay for $100.

If you do not want to give up, you can try some plumber&#39;s epoxy putty.  I
use Oatey brand I get from Home Depot. I use this for baffles in metal MPs.

Thanks Keith. Kinda figured as much. I might still give it a shot 
using 
the epoxy you&#39;ve mentioned.
What&#39;s the best way to get the bite plate out considering the flimsy 
nature of the tip?

I sent this on your site but will do it here also:
Do you still have any glass gauges left? If so how much and please 
let me know how to get one.

I would leave it in.  Sounds like it is the only thing holding the tip
together.  If there is a gouge in it, fill it.
