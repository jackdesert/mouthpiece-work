            <pre class='message__body'>hello Steve and alls: (please sorry my poor english language)

I believe that when someone expose examples of somethig on a group 
dedicated to Mouthpiece work, signifies presume that is with the 
intention of collaboration with alls associated to same.

But when the intention of anyone of us, is for auto-promotion and in 
definive, auto-sell, i have not been of accordance.

At any raid, i think that the mouthpiece performance technics, is 
something very! very! very! (how tell you Steve in your videos) very 
empiric, absolutely personal, impossible of determine by theoricals 
reasons and only probable into the mouth of player.

I consider those to give cientifical formulas; but i also consider 
that is possible obtain good result with patience, treating to sucess 
and error, jus as it is almost all to doing. Isn&#39;t it?

Later, we will see how to do the graphical, the formulas, the own 
diagram of the goods mouthpiece. That the genius and the gurues of 
the mouthpiece technics point out and talk us the tens of errors that 
we not must commit. 

I believe for that was to do this forum. IsnÂ´t it?

Sorry newlly my poor English idiom.
