            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been working on hot roding a Link STM.  I&#39;ll post some details 
and photos soon.

Anyone know about the details of the plating?  The one I&#39;m working on 
is scuffed up in spots.  I can see the base brass, a layer of silver, 
a layer of shiny gold, and a cloudy suface layer that is a mystery to 
me.  I&#39;m not sure if it is another layer of gold or a laquer or 
what.  It could just be crud.  It is thin, but I can feel the 
thickness with my fingernail.

I noticed it when I was trying to remove some surface scratches with 
steel wool.  It seemed like a layer of "skin" was coming off.  I 
stopped because I was not sure if I wanted to strip off the gold.  
Now, I&#39;m thinking of having it replated in silver anyhow so I may dig 
into it again.  I&#39;ll probably try lacquer thinner first.

Any ideas?

            <pre class='message__body'>Lacquer thinner and elbow grease worked to remove the crud.  The 
previous owner used this Link to test out several epoxy baffle 
shapes.  I think the crud was a film from layers of thin epoxy 
flavored water.
