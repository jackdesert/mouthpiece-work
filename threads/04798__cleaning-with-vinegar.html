            <pre class='message__body'>Vinegar is acidic, and easily dissolves the white calcified deposits from saliva.  Ten to 30 minutes will usually dissolve calcium deposits.  This may leave hard rubber discolored, but I don&#39;t know of any better way to remove the white deposits.
   
  For disinfecting, nothing beats a 10% solution of chlorine bleach (Clorox, Purex, etc), 10% bleach/90% water. 
   
  Discoloration is usually just on the very surface of the mouthpiece.  I have had good success removing that with Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, a white foam sponge scrubber.  After that, I polish with Kit Scratchout, a plastic polish sold in automotive stores for polishing plexiglass.
   
  If there are scratches, they can be sanded out with 600 grit paper, then 800, then  1000 or 1200, 1500, 2000.  Finally, polish with the plastic polish by hand with a soft cloth.  This may not be as shiny as buffing with a buffing wheel, but there is not as much chance of damaging the facing... so common when buffing with a motorized buffing wheel.

          Hello all,

Apologies as usual if this has been gone over before, but what are your thoughts on cleaning mouthpieces with plain white vinegar?  i let the mouthpiece soak in the white vinegar for an hour or so, then use a soft toothbrush and lukewarm tapwater to scrub away the rest of the deposits.  I&#39;ve been doing it to my pieces every once in a while with success, but have refrained from advising others to do it because it doesn&#39;t have the official mouthpiecework seal of approval.  any problems with using white vinegar? 

if this is a bad method, what method do others suggest for cleaning mouthpieces?

            <pre class='message__body'>Try using a product called Kaboom, which is available in a big purple
spray bottle.  Spray it on the mouthpiece and then spray some in a
shallow container that you can let it soak for a while.  It easily
dissolves the deposits quickly and doesn&#39;t discolor the mouthpiece,
although it doesn&#39;t smell very good!
