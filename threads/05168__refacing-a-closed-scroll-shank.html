            <pre class='message__body'>Whattaya&#39;ll do when it comes to opening up a relatively closed scroll
shank-like mouthpiece?  I worked on a beater Selmer long shank C*
today which sounded great to begin with but I wanted to open it up to
.080" or so.  Wanted to leave as much meat in the tip as possible so I
started taking down the table from the shank end and very quickly
ended up right on top of the scroll--just not enough clearance to get
the angle, that end of the table needed to go below the level of the
scroll.  At first I tried working around it but eventually decided,
screw it, it&#39;s my mouthpiece and it&#39;s a beater anyway, I&#39;m going to
take down the scroll with the table as much as I need to in order to
get the opening I want.  The results were excellent, but now the
scroll is flattened out in line with the table.  Is that sacrilege or
what?

            <pre class='message__body'>This is a common problem with angling the table (or "butt-cutting") to open
a tip.  To get .010" at the tip, you need to typically cut .030-.035" off
the heel of the table.  It also widens the table and makes the ligature fit
loosely.  You can trim the table width and sometimes shorten a metal
ligature.  You can place a MP patch on top of the MP to make the lig work
again.
