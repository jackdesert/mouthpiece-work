            <pre class='message__body'>Hi - Back on the 20th, in response to spring 64&#39;s ?, I stuck my neck out re: 
patents, since I worked for quite a few years as a technical "assistant" to 
patent attorneys, in the promotion of patentable ideas to patents and the prior 
art searching by computer and in the USPat. Office.  I&#39;m quite interested in 
the German "compilation" of musical inst/accessories patents. I will be glad to 
help anyone find and then get copies of pats found by searches.  I do this 
for persons on woodwind.org etc , usually for no charge, if "simple" to do. I am 
a mediocre cl/sax&#39;ist, dabble in repairs and refacings. Don Berger
