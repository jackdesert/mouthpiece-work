            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Experts, 
Before trying refacing my troublesome Soprano Dukoff MP (pls refer to thread: Soprano Dukoff - Fighting squeeks story...), I decided to try first the techniques on a scratch Alto Super PowerChamber D8 (provided by a group member). This MP looked like it has been gone though an over-sanding of the table process for uknown reasons, that left it with very thin table and very little rails with almost zero tip opening!
(sorry no photos before or during the process, only for the final outcome)
My idea was to re-built  the worn table and side rails with metal glue and then try a refacing to an elliptical facing.
The rebuilt process started by creating a &#39;molding&#39; structure by adhesive tapes for the table and rails, but a bit oversized to allow sanding later on.  
After the metal glue dried (actually 1 week later as did not have time sooner!), I started the refacing process.
Initially by using files and then hard (400) sandpapers to take out the excessive glue material carefully.
The tools used afterwards were a home-made glass gauge (thanks to someone of you for the tip to use two microscope glasses as sandwitch around a transparency printed film, and glued together with special grass glue), automotive feeler set and various files and sandpapers.
Facing data were calculated in Excel for a .110 tip opening.
The process took few hours and the result is attached (zip with 3 photos, still some small work is needed for the window but will do later on)
The refaced (or better say revived?) MP plays remarkably good, very free blowing giving all octave range with good tonality and altissimos as well (is this the luck of the amateur? LOL)

One thing I would like to ask you if you know is if the metal glue material is somehow toxic and so is risky to put the MP in the mouth of the sax player (me!)
I will be glad to answer any questions regarding my first refacing experience, that I enjoyed a lot.

My sincere thanks (and respect to Mojo) for his very informative videos on YT and in general to all this group  members for their contributions.

cheers

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Gianni,

Firstly, congratulations on a successful outcome. Without knowing what
material you used to build up the table I can&#39;t answer with regard to
toxicity, but some clarinet mouthpiece techs routinely use epoxy type
materials to build up tips and rails. I have a mouthpiece on which I built
up a damaged tip which has given me no problems in the 3-4 years since I
rebuilt it.

Check to see if the metal glue you used has an MSDS (material safety data sheet) available online. That would answer your question most accurately. I like the epoxies that are for use in water supplies. Ones for automotive use I am more suspicious of. But after they dry, it would depend on the amount of lead and zinc in the compound and if it will leach out.

Thanks for your messages. 

Seems JB Weld metal glue is not 100% safe for mouthpieces repairs as in most cases it interacts with the player&#39;s mouth!
Any other compound that can be safely used for MP repairs?
And then what material can someone use to add a fixed baffle in a metal MP (like a Dukoff) ??

Cheers

JBWeld contains high levels of Bisphenol Alpha, a xeroestrogen, for which there is mounting evidence of involvement in developmental disorders of the reproductive system (especially in males) including low sperm counts and possibly testicular cancer. Because it is widely used in the food industry and the plastics industry, there is heavy pressure not to regulate it, but it has now been banned in products for babies. I would not use it in any capacity in which it could be ingested. A few years ago in a similar discussion, JBWeld, when asked directly about safety, said that they did not recommend it for uses in which it came into contact with the mouth.

I like the epoxies that are for use in water supplies. Ones for automotive use I am more suspicious of. But after they dry, it would depend on the amount of lead and zinc in the compound and if it will leach out.

            <pre class='message__body'>There&#39;s a material dentists use that can be shaped like putty and then is cured to rock-like hardness just by shining ultraviolet light on it. Then it can be filed and sanded (just like dental enamel). I&#39;m not sure if it is technically an epoxy. You may be able to find it on eBay.

Sounds like a brilliant idea! A member of our (amateur) group is a (professional) dentist!!!
I shall check with him if the material indicated can work (bond) on a metal mouthpiece.
By definition it should be much more safer than any epoxy.

Thanks for your messages. 

Seems JB Weld metal glue is not 100% safe for mouthpieces repairs as in most cases it interacts with the player&#39;s mouth!
Any other compound that can be safely used for MP repairs?
And then what material can someone use to add a fixed baffle in a metal MP (like a Dukoff) ??

            <pre class='message__body'>Not all epoxies contain BPA, though many do, to varying degrees. It is 
not highly toxic, but neither is it inert, and I avoid it whenever 
possible. It may be no coincidence that worldwide sperm counts have 
dropped more than 50% since the introduction of BPA and other endocrine 
disrupters into general use. Cyanoacrylates, for instance are 100% inert 
when cured--the gel type can be substituted in many cases for epoxies, 
though it has to be built up in layers and is more difficult to work 
with. I have used it very successfully for restoring mpcs with deep 
tooth grooves. It has the added advantage of being much harder than most 
epoxies after it is cured, though it is too brittle for some uses. I 
don&#39;t think there is much harm in epoxies being used inside mpcs, to 
build up baffles, for instance, but I personally try to avoid using it 
where it comes in contact with any oral mucosa.

There are BPA free epoxies; JBWeld is not one of them.

            <pre class='message__body'>While I may sound like I am pro BPA, I really do appreciate you taking the time to periodically point out that there is a risk.  It is up to each of us to decide if it is an acceptable risk or not. 

We also tend to be more concerned about repair materials than we are about the original materials used, which may have similar risks.

It may be no coincidence that worldwide sperm counts have dropped more than 50% since the introduction of BPA and other endocrine disrupters into general use. Cyanoacrylates, for instance are 100% inert when cured--the gel type can be substituted in many cases for epoxies, though it has to be built up in layers and is more difficult to work with. I have used it very successfully for restoring mpcs with deep tooth grooves. It has the added advantage of being much harder than most epoxies after it is cured, though it is too brittle for some uses. I don&#39;t think there is much harm in epoxies being used inside mpcs, to build up baffles, for instance, but I personally try to avoid using it where it comes in contact with any oral mucosa.

Because it is widely used in the food industry and the plastics industry, there is heavy pressure not to regulate it, but it has now been banned in products for babies. I would not use it in any capacity in which it could be ingested. A few years ago in a similar discussion, JBWeld, when asked directly about safety, said that they did not recommend it for uses in which it came into contact with the mouth.

I like the epoxies that are for use in water supplies. Ones for automotive use I am more suspicious of. But after they dry, it would depend on the amount of lead and zinc in the compound and if it will leach out.
