            <pre class='message__body'>We&#39;re going to shoot this last sections of the mouthpiece refacing video
this weekend, so if you have any last minute suggestions, now is the time.

As always, a project like this takes more time and costs more money than my
original plan..what we&#39;ve shot so far looks great...we&#39;ll begin editing next
week. I&#39;ll post an announcement when it&#39;s ready (editing takes a while!) and
for sale on our sites and on eBay. Other than some YouTube stuff, I haven&#39;t
seen another professionally shot and edited video on this topic.
