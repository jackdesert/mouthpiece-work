            <pre class='message__body'>As a guy with a day job that includes how to move expensive stuff
without damage, I would like to make a point about reeds left on
mouthpieces.  No matter if you are leave the reed till it grows a crop
or new reed every time crowd, always keep a reed of some kind and
usefulness on the mouthpiece all the time.  A reed is the best
protection the tip,  rails and table of a mouthpiece can have.  The reed
does not have to be tightly secured with the ligature and it does not
need to be a playable setup, but that  piece of cane or synthetic is the
best armor against mouthpiece damage.
