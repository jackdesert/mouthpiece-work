            <pre class='message__body'>Mr S, I have been following you and your group on most of
the subjects.  I am curious about the
following for my own info, also possibly it could be a part of your marketing
program, from what I detect, you have been partial to the Buescher’s, and I am
wondering how the bore of my Buescher Alto 400and your saxophones compare? 
I will be buying one of your saxophones in the future, so
you might say I am more than just a little curious.
Thank you in advance,
Joe Petrof

            <pre class='message__body'>Joe:

To answer your question: our various alto models all have different bore diameters and tapers. The Marcel is the smallest diameter with the least taper; the Super 400 is the largest with the most pronounced taper; the Voodoo Rex falls somewhere in between. The Voodoo Rex is the closest to the Buescher 400, although it is in no way a copy of the Buescher, but is our unique design. If you need more information, please email me privately.
