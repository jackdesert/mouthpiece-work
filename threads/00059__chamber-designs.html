I hope that one or more of you mouthpiece gurus (especially Phil) would make some general comments on chamber design (beyond "large is dark, small is bright") and configuration.

BTW, I&#39;m really glad to see that this list is off to a good start with regard to participation. I&#39;m particulary honored that Phil Barone has joined in. It&#39;s been my pleasure and honor to do business with him for a number of years, and I have the greatest admiration for his craftsmanship.
