            <pre class='message__body'>Dear all 

I dropped my Lawton and it is damaged on the tip and in need of a 
repair job. As I do not know who is the best person who could repair my 
mouthpiece could you kindly suggest a repair person who has 
successfully done such a job in the past.

Please contact me directly and I will get back to you.

thanks and all the best

Hi Keith i posted 3 photos under Photos [bluesrocksax]. One can see a 
small mark and some unskilled person used a file to clear it away. 
Kindly let me know if the mpc can be fixt.

thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>I moved the photos into their own folder and made them public if anyone
else wants to look at them.  Looks like a typical metal tip drop result. 
Should clean up with a full reface.
