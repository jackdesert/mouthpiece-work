I&#39;m wondering who(m) people have used as plating companies?
I know of Anderson plating - any others? Specifically, that have

          I would only use spot plating on the table area , when the object is to prevent oxidation.   If areas on the rails lacks
          plating it is best to get the facing curve up to specification and replate.   I would not remove any silverplating  before
          replating if the curve is correct.  After applying about 20 microns of silver the Mouthpiece and curve can be lightly polished 
          by hand. Then the curve should be  checked.
          Make the plating company understand that NO BUFFING should be done at any stage.
          If the plating was done without buffing , at normal (or low) current density , with the correct size anode , the facing curve
          should need no work.

Thanks, Toby. That&#39;s what I was afraid of. Can these
little areas be spot-plated or do I need to take the
silver off the entire table and facing? I&#39;d surely
ruin the mouthpiece if I attempted that. I&#39;ve not had
great success at refacing recently.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thad is exactly right on all points.  The chemicals involved include 
cyanide.   I do note that many of the home kits for brush plating are 
"cyanide free". 

I had a music store owner tell me that an EPA person came in and 
demanded, "Do you do instrument repair?  Show me your plating 
equipment."  He replied, "I don&#39;t have plating equipment, I send 
instruments out for plating."  The guy said, "You must have plating 
equipment... it says right here in my book that music stores that repair 
instruments do plating, and I want to see it right now."  Hah, but that 
is what you deal with. 

I know that at Runyon, other than raw materials, printing, catalogs, 
shipping materials, plating is the only thing not done "in house".   
Just too much hassle for the quantity, they say.  They use a 
professional plater.  There is also a plater in New Orleans Steve 
Goodson recommended to me.

          SILVERPLATING is simple if one stick to a couple of rules.  A mouthpiece can be plated in a container filled with only one
          liter of solution.
          Silver is my preferred plating medium --- it plates very EVENLY -- meaning it spreads well even inside the bore of the 
          mouthpiece.  According to the books and my limited experience most plating solutions will concentrate and even
            "burn" the sharp edges. Silver does not have this problem.
 
          Most people doing plating have a small test tank (0.5 liter ? ) . A brass plate is set at fixed angle with respect to the anode,
          then plated with a couple of microns. Examining the little plate one can determine if the solution is corect. During
          this procedure it can be seen that silver spreads extremely well ( measuring the thickness of the deposit on various spots) 
           
          Simple rules:
          When plating a single mouthpiece make sure the size (area) of the anode(s) is almost the same as the total area of the
          mouthpiece (inside + outside).
 
          The solution must be at the correct temperature , at least 20&#39;C  typically 25&#39;C.
 
          Solution must be up to standard, no organic/metallic contamination , with the correct amount of silver in solution.
 
          Make sure the electrical connections are sound. For mouthpieces a 3.5 MM diameter copper conducter can be
          bent to form a "hook" with a diameter slightly bigger than the bore of the mouthpiece. This "hook" gets inserted
          into the bore where it maintains a good contact.  The size of the hook can be adjusted before insertion to have the 
          correct amount of "spring" . 
          
          The electical source must be well regulated and smooth (DC) with almost no ripple. The potential MUST EXIST BEFORE
          the metal enters the solution and should not drop a lot when the current starts to flow.  Using a Cyanide silver solution
          I have plated directly over brass (without a strike) . During plating I set the voltage to 1.5 Volt which is on the low side,
          this gives me a harder than normal layer of silver. Before lowering the (raw brass) mouthpiece into the solution the voltage
          will be closer to the specified voltage (1.8 to 2 VOLTS) to assure that electrical plating (and not chemical deposition)
          takes place during the first couple of microns.
 
          Piece must be CLEAN .
          
          Most metals might need a "strike" before plating in silver.
 
          When plating after a Nickel strike  no time should be wasted . As soon as the nickel plating stops the piece should
          be RINSED WELL and immediately be plated in silver.
 
          SMALL CONTAINER:
          When plating in a small (1 or 2 liter) container a magnetic stirrer should be used.  It only make sense to get as much
          as possible distance between the mouthpiece and anode.
          Rotating the mouthpiece every minute or so wont do any harm . Even though I know silver spreads well I do rotate
          favouring the facing side.   
          Keep the voltage to the lower side of the range. To high a voltage leads to "burn" and poor finish. With the correct
          voltage the piece comes out smooth and needs very little polishing.
 
          SAFETY
          The most popular silverplating solution contains cyanide. Care should be taken to work in a well ventilated area.
          NOTHING acidic should be in the immediate surrounding. One drop of acid entering the solution will form a very
          deadly cyanide gas. That is one of the reasons a piece gets cleaned and rinsed in more than one bath before
          going to the silver bath.
 
          EPA
          Do not dispose of used solotion in any unlawfull way (sewerage , garbage dump..etc)
 
          Happy Plating !!

200 and 100 liter tanks!? Whoa.
 
In truth, my education in the plating process began when this thread began. I have access to jewelers who do this work on a regular basis and who do contract work for other jewelers, so I started asking questions and watching last week after a shoot. (I photograph in-store because I really don&#39;t feel like transporting  single pieces of jewelry that cost more than everything I own combined.
 
The tanks that the jewelers I know use much smaller tanks (probably 1 liters and four liters--- I may be off by a liter or two). What I am seeing being plated are very intricately tooled rings and bracelets (designed and created in-house) as well as very plain bangle-type bracelets. 
 
If you&#39;re working with 200 and 100 liter tanks, you&#39;re plating more than mouthpieces, I suspect. You must plate whole horns and automobile bumpers. You&#39;ve got a whole lot more going on in your tanks  than a jeweler would have going on in his tanks, and a whole lot more invested in equipment to control the variables (e.g., recovery systems and the like). 
 
Something which hadn&#39;t occurred to me is this: when you use a larger tank, are you  likely to have a more or less "accurate" or even distribution of the plating material than if you were to use a smaller tank? (If you use only these larger tanks, you might not know).
