            <pre class='message__body'>Hi bass clarinet question

I live in Brazil, and speak portuguese. My english is poor.

I have a problem with mouthpiece
If you press in the center of the reed sound comes out more easily.
I changed reeds and changed ligature.

But not resolved.

I supose the table is curved

You are help-me with sugestions?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Adriana,  That is a very common problem and is usually caused by a reed that is not flat . Of course the mouthpiece table needs to be checked for flatness first, but more often the reed is at fault.
  If you live in an area where the humidity changes often you are more likely to have such problems.The reed just curves across the grain with the changing weather.
  Reeds can be flattened sometimes by sliding them over fine sand paper on a sheet of glass. Make sure you don't sand the tip. The high spot can also be  scraped  first with  a straight blade such as a reed knife.
  Also every time you finish playing you will see the impression of the mouthpiece window on the reed. This causes a high spot too. It can be scraped away and then the reed  should be flattened again.
  A good test is to try playing with a synthetic reed to see if you have the same problem. Synthetics are flat, do not warp  and do not easily form an impression after playing. I don't personally like the sound I get with synthetic reeds but many players are very happy with them.
