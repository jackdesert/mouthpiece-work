            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,
I&#39;ve built a number of steel bicycles using investment cast lugs to join the
tubing together.  These are much nicer to use than formed and welded lugs
because of the nice finish, crisp edges AND tight tolerances.  About
.010-inches (.25-mm) radial clearance to make it easy to sweat silver solder
into the joint.

            <pre class='message__body'>One of my students, who is in the metal working business in a very big way
and who is an engineer, had some contact with a company that seemed to do
some unusually fine work. On some of the mouthpieces we manufacture, almost
30 individual cuts are required to turn a bar of metal stock into the blank
we need. It seems to me that the investment casting technique could possibly
be very useful in reducing the number of steps we are currently going
through. I have no experience with casting, but it sure looks like an easier
way to shape the interior! In the worst case scenario, it appears that all
we would have to do is to have our machinist clean up the casting and make
the edges nice and sharp (or smooth) as we need them to be.
