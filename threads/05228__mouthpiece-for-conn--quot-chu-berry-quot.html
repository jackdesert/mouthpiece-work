I have a Conn Eagle mpc as well as several others and it seems as
though the Conn mpc should only be put on partway.  When I put the
conn mpc on all the way, the tone is really weak and won&#39;t play at all
on the higher notes. Others (with longer shanks) will slide all the

LOT of harmonic distortion/warbling on the low notes.

            <pre class='message__body'>sounds like you might need your neck cork replaced.  also i imagine it woudl 
depend on where you have the tuner set.

            <pre class='message__body'>Chu Berry used an early version of the Runyon Custom.  The closest mouthpiece I know of to that is the Conn Comet.  I have altos and tenors here, newly finished from ORIGINAL blanks.  Many people like how these play on their vintage Conns.
   
  I have the altos only in a dark amber.  These are made from blanks that apparently had too much tint added to the mix, and that was why they were not made into mouthpieces.  Facings are Runyon 7&#39;s, and actually measure .080" tip opening.
   
  I have a few tenors in the ivory color.  They have Runyon 8 facings, .098" tip opening.

them here&#39;s a couple articles on Conn micro-tuner necks:

I think the mouthpiece is intended to slide all the way onto the neck,
not partway.

Low notes were not that easy, I could play them clearly and loud only
when I was in a good shape, otherwise warbling was a problem. It might
have not been due to the mouthpiece - an old repairman had told me
that it is a common problem with vintage Conns and that they sometimes
partially filled the elbow with some material to make the low notes
play more easily. But that can be just a hearsay.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had the "warbling" problem when I first started playing my horn.  I put the mouthpiece on the same way that I would on my tenor - about 1/2 way onto the cork.  It would stop warbling when I put something into the bow.  I spoke with my local repair person & it was suggested that there could be a leak.  We checked with a light & didn&#39;t find anything, but we were checking it out for free & didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on it.

I went home & tried putting the mpc all the way onto the neck & LO-AND-BEHOLD no more warble (with that mpc).  I tried some other mouthpieces and some had different qualities (as one would expect).  Also, I think that a lot depends on developing a different technique from my tenor technique.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m glad somebody mentioned mouthpiece position as often times just
moving the mouthpiece in a 1/4 inch will work wonders.  Generally
those old large chamber mouthpieces were designed to go pretty much
all the way in (or at least cover the cork) and the newer high baffle
mouthpieces had to be pulled out to keep the volume of the cone
correct.  All the tricks with putting something in the bow (either a
wine cork, rubber ball, etc) or soldering a plate down there simply
reduces the volume in the cone the same way pushing the mouthpiece in.
 By cone, I&#39;m referring to the area from the tip of the mouthpiece to
the end of the bell of the sax.  I&#39;ve had many customers come to me to
fix the burbling and once I check for leaks and make sure the player
has a good embouchure, I&#39;ll have them move the mouthpiece in and lo
and behold the burbling goes away.
