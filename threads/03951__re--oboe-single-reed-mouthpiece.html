  Well, what I read was that these things never were worth a darn--basically a gimmick. That&#39;s probably why they are so rare...

This brings to mind Eddie Harris playing trumpet with a sax mouthpiece.

I saw one of those sax-trumpet mouthpieces. (No, I don&#39;t know if it ever
actually belonged to Eddie Harris; a local dealer had it, but I didn&#39;t
inquire as to its pedigree.)

It was *not* just a soprano mouthpiece with an adapter to fit on trumpet.
The chamber and baffle were radically different from the normal mouthpiece
(extremely narrow throat, baffle very close to the reed, very low internal
volume overall.)

My point being that maybe the oboe single-reed mouthpieces worked badly
because the basic design was in need of improvement.

            <pre class='message__body'>It sounded exactly like a bassoon played with a double reed.  It uses a 
conventional Bb Clarinet reed.  Rico Plasticover gives the right amount 
of edge to sound like a regular double reed.  Most players use a #2 or 
#2 1/2.

BTW, you have not lived until you have heard Santy Runyon play Yakety 
Sax on the bassoon...  alas, I have, and it is too late for you other guys.

The mouthpiece may be used with the conventional double lip bassoon 
embouchure, as it is rather thin, like a "duckbill" design, or with 
teeth on top as a single reed player would do.

Bassoonist Sam Jordon, of the Chicago Symphony, used the mouthpiece for 
some of his recordings with the Chicago Symphony Woodwind Quintet.  The 
single reed mouthpiece does not have the raucous breakup on the lowest 
note like the double reed.

Never intended as a complete replacement for the double reed, but rather 
as a aid to doubling in the pit orchestra, or very quickly transitioning 
a clarinet or saxophone player to the saxophone.

http://www.runyonproducts.com/bassoon.html

It comes with a tiny ligature and cap.  Tuning is still done where the 
bocal plugs into the body of the bassoon, as is usual.  The bassoon 
mouthpiece is pushed on to bottom out on the bocal.  Since not all 
bocals are the same diameter, the fit may be loose.  If that is the 
case, a wrap or two of clear "Scotch tape" around the end of the bocal 
will give the right fit.

Exactly!

In discussions with Santy Runyon about his bassoon mouthpiece, here is 
what he did... he obtained playable bassoon reeds made by a number of 
professional players in the Chicago area.  He then taped the edges 
closed, to seal, and measured the volume of each one with drops of water 
from an eyedropper.  He took an average from that (he found they were 
all fairly close anyway), and made the internal volume of his mouthpiece 
match that.  He made the distance from the end of the bocal to the end 
of the reed the same.  If you look at one of these, you will see that 
the tip of the clarinet reed is close to the width of the end of a 
bassoon double reed.  The baffle, or roof of the chamber lies very close 
to the reed, and the contour not unlike the inside of the double reed 
itself.  All this smoothly leading into the end of the bocal.

Bassoonists are naturally skeptical of this mouthpiece, and they should 
be, but are quite surprised at how well it plays.  I have been told by 
several of Sam Jordon&#39;s students, now pro&#39;s and teachers, that he 
insisted they have a Runyon bassoon mouthpiece in their "toolkit".  Not 
for fulltime use, but there are places it comes in handy.

  This brings to mind Eddie Harris playing trumpet with a sax mouthpiece.

  I saw one of those sax-trumpet mouthpieces. (No, I don&#39;t know if it ever
  actually belonged to Eddie Harris; a local dealer had it, but I didn&#39;t
  inquire as to its pedigree.)

  It was *not* just a soprano mouthpiece with an adapter to fit on trumpet.
  The chamber and baffle were radically different from the normal mouthpiece
  (extremely narrow throat, baffle very close to the reed, very low internal
  volume overall.)

  My point being that maybe the oboe single-reed mouthpieces worked badly
  because the basic design was in need of improvement.

  Barry

  Certainly that plays a part in it, but as a former serious oboe player I have to point out that an oboe reed is about 1/2 the width of any existing single reed, and the internal volume of an oboe reed is extremely small, so you are immediately up against design problems that you do not have to the same degree with a bassoon single-reed mpc, for instance. Not that a decent oboe mpc couldn&#39;t perhaps be designed, but there are factors in this that do not scale linearly, and which become much trickier as size is reduced.

            <pre class='message__body'>No  Linton  but it was  a Chedeville 264B.  I bought it in the late 60&#39;s early 70&#39;s to ease doubling.  But I just didn&#39;t even sound like an oboe so a gave up after only a few practice sessions.  I never pursued  any resurfacing and put he darn thing in my mouthpiece drawer  for 40 years.  Sold it  on Ebay several months ago.  Good riddance as far as I&#39;m concerned.  

BTW, I had a guy contact me who was a bagpipe player and wanted to try it for the &#39;pipes.  But I sold it already.

Also, I&#39;m like to thank Paul for his referance to his talks to Sany R. about the Bassoon  single reed MP. Where else can we get infro like this but from is group?

Thank you... I know I sometime say to often, "Santy said..."  but he was 
a walking, talking encylopedia of American Music History and all things 
Saxophone.  I wanted to follow him around with a note pad and tape 
recorder, but that could have been inhibiting.

He has been gone two years now, and I still find myself thinking, "I 
wonder what Santy knows about ......" and have to stop myself from 
reaching for the phone.
