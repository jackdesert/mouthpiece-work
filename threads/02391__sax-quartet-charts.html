            <pre class='message__body'>Having and playing the wonderful 4tet charts that Paul Coats has 
arranged, I&#39;m now looking to do some trading to enlarge my library 
of 180 4tet charts. I was wondering if anyone reading this would be 
interested in doing a little swapping.  We are a professional group 
of players and would like some of the more challenging 
charts....i.e, the French genre (Paris Conservatoire)... drop me an 
an email and I&#39;ll send you my list in either excel or word format.

Thanks,

Fred

            <pre class='message__body'>Fred - A couple of years ago, Tim Reis&#39; [NYC?] 4tet played with our local  
symp [Very Well !]. We got acquainted, since I have a couple of nice old altos,  
and he gave me a CD in which several of his groups sure played well.  You  
might try to contact him, perhaps by a Google search?  Our Tulsa Comm Band  
conductor is quite skillful on the smaller saxes [and clar] and we have others  in 
Tulsa [Local 94] who outplay me, and might be interested in chart exchange
