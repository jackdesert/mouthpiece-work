            <pre class='message__body'>I don´t have a 7, but a Bellite Custom 5 that I have modified several times. First facing length 44/tip opening 0.080 (#6#), then I reduced it to facing length 39/opening 0.078. I find this one plays best with a shorter facing length, (almost as  it originally had), but with a facing curve that not longer is uneven, and slightly flatter at the start that is was.
