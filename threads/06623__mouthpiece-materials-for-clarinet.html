            <pre class='message__body'>Very nice piece, Brent.

FYI, the wall vibrations in a clarinet have been measured at 1 micron, which gives a ratio of sound from wall vibrations to total radiated sound of 1 to 10000, or minus 40 dB, which all experts agree is imperceptible. In addition Backus did an ingenious experiment which consisted of inverting the
 sound signal of the radiated sound plus wall vibrations and adding it to the sound of the air column, which (I have read) proved the above point empirically, as the sound was completely cancelled.

Nederveen reports unusual vibratory modes in the mpc (including the double of the note being sounded), and posits a possibility of 3 dB difference depending on the effect of reed slap causing the mpc to vibrate. This has not be proven.

You are probably aware of this study, but I post the link anyway:

            <pre class='message__body'>In all the many discussions of mouthpiece materials I¹ve seen online, I
don¹t recall seeing a discussion regarding the dimensional stability of a
mouthpiece while actually being played.

While this may be a negligible factor with some players, especially those
who play with double embouchures, I would think that some deviations of the
facing curve might occur in hard rubber or plastic mouthpieces as a
consequence of tooth pressure on the beak.  These changes might be slight,
but as we know, it doesn¹t take much to change the playing characteristics
of a mouthpiece.

I remember reading somewhere that Serge Challoff actually broke the neck of
a bari sax once while playing, and wondering, could he have been pressing
that hard against the beak (not necessarily biting, but even just pushing
down on it.)?
