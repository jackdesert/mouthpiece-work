            <pre class='message__body'>Ralph Morgan listed some "specs" of vintage mouthpieces in his 
March/April 1993 Sax Journal column.  I think Paul Coats said this 
info came from an earlier edition of the Erik Brand book.  

I have checked a few original-looking Woodwind and Link mouthpieces 
against the numbers posted and have not found good agreement.  
Mouthpieces just vary a lot.  Here is what was listed for a Dick 
Stabile Alto:

42157 (Erik Brand designation: Length mm*2 & Tip mm)
42
29
20
13
6
157 (= .062" tip)

Erik Brand feeler set:
.0015, .010, .024, .034, .050"

            <pre class='message__body'>I had a Dick Stabile alto that was very cool...came in the case with 
a Buescher Big B alto. A friend became enamored of it and I sold it 
to him as I have always used old Meyers on alto mostly.
It was really quite similar to the old Meyers...

Where did you get it? Internet info on Dick Stabile places his band in the Blue Room at the Fairmont Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans in the mid &#39;seventies, but I remember my parents taking me to hear him play in the late &#39;sixties at the Blue Room. I remember one of the two major music stores (Grunewald&#39;s) selling the Stabile mouthpiece AND the Dick Stabile saxophone at about the same time. I&#39;m wondering when he began putting his name on horns and mouthpieces. Anyone know?
 
Mr. PC--- you&#39;re from those parts too. Do you know?

            <pre class='message__body'>Coolbaffle&#39;s measurements are much closer to the "specs" than I expected.

In my experiance with comparing vintage Woodwind brand mouthpieces there
were descrepancies of several numbers.  Maybe I just had bad luck or CB has
had good luck.

            <pre class='message__body'>This compare quite well with the specs in the old Eric Brand manual:

Cool Baffle&#39;s (E. Brand)

42,4          (42 E Brand)
30             (29 E Brand)
20             (20 E Brand)
13             (13 E Brand)
6               (6  E Brand)
tip opening: 1.56 mm (.061)    (157 E Brand)

This is well within what would be expected of normal production 
tolerances, and confirms the validity of the old E. Brand numbers.
