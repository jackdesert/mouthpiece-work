  I just acquired a used stainless steel Berg Larsen for tenor sax. It is very apparent that the table, rails, tip and baffle all have had work done on them. There are no machine marks on the table, rail or tip. The table is flat and the tip gap is correct and a reed seals very well. So who ever did this knew a little about what he was doing. The baffle was done by someone else. Looks like they used a coarse round file to remove the baffle. Just down the middle of the MP. Leaving gouges and scratches from the chamber to within 4 mm of the tip. I used clay to rebuid the baffle and the piece played and sounded great.

            <pre class='message__body'>A buddy has given me an older stainless Berg tenor mpc
and I&#39;ve got a couple of questions.

The piece looks as if it may have had work done at
some point.  I&#39;m thinking that for a couple of
reasons.  First there appear to be some file marks at
the tip.  Secondly there is an enscription that reads
as follows - 

DON      RLCDESIC      [some of this is hard to read]
 AND      851427

The piece is a 100 2sms but it measures .095 at the
tip.

My buddy said that he&#39;s had this piece for probably
about 20-30 years but hasn&#39;t played for almost that
long as well.

Any thoughts about who the refacer might have been?

I play tested the piece for about 5 mins and it plays
great but I&#39;m not used to Bergs at all.

Thanks
Ralph
