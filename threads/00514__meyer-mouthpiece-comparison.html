started modifying some mouthpieces.  Before finding this group I was 
just searching out anything I could find on the net.  I have posted a 
file uder the alto section of the files directory on the comparison 
of different meyer mouthpieces.  I found this at 
http://www.dornpub.com who are the publishers of sax journal.

Lots of great info in this group keep up the good work.

            <pre class='message__body'>Glad you found us Lindsay Paul.

I did have a link to the Sax Journal site that has this article under 
the Links, Literature area.

I guess this article can be considered public domian since it is up 
on their site.  But as a general rule, I would like us to have 
permission when we post information that might belong to a 
publisher/author.  Especially if they are still trying to sell back 
issues with these articles in it.

I&#39;m a pack rat like most of you and I do exchange copies of materials 
privately.  But we all need to draw the line somewhere.  So this is 
just a word of caution.

I hope some day to obtain permission from Dorn to allow the posting 
of out-of-print mouthpiece articles from Sax Journal.
