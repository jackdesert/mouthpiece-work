            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everybody,

there are allways people not agreeing with each other about mouhtpiece materials and wether they matter or not.

But what I was wondering is; can you exactly reproduce a mouthpiece in 2 such different materials.

 I&#39;m well known with lathes and mills and experience has learned me that when I mill or lathe a plastic I have to calculate the amount of elasticity from the material because when milling or lathing a soft material it dents in (? not to good with technical english) so I would have greater tolerances, say .5 to 1 mm and when milling or lathing steel I can have tolerances of say .1 to .2 easily.

however I never milled mouthpiece rubber, or even a mouthpiece for that matter. So what are your experiences on this matter?

to be clear: I dont want to get a material discussion started just a technical question about acheivable tolerances on mouhthpiece materials.

Regards,

Koen

Different plastics cut differently.  Delrin and ebonite both cut very well and hold tolerances within a couple thou (.08mm), maybe closer, assuming best practices -- good workholding, appropriate feeds/speeds/toolpaths/cutter geometry for the material.  No experience of it but polycarbonate probably does as well, acrylic and nylon push away from the cutter more.

FWIW I often use delrin for prototyping because it&#39;s cheap and I can use the same toolpaths as for brass but run the machine as fast as it can go.  With ebonite you have to be more conservative with doc and chipload or it chips.  Also dulls cutters much faster.

At any rate, I have made many identical mouhtpieces in both delrin and free machining brass.  The differences between them are smaller than I can measure, but I don&#39;t have access to the metrology you do.  Maybe I should send you a couple and we can see.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes that seems pretty accurate for reproducing purposes, they are CNC
machined right? Anyway  I&#39;d love to compare 2 mouthpieces when I&#39;m finished
with prototyping and programming. When I&#39;m done testing I&#39;ll contact you and
we can discuss how we&#39;ll arange it by e-mail.

 

(btw; apologies for the delayed response I was away camping for the weekend)
