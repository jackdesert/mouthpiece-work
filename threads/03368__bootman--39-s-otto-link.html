            <pre class='message__body'>I recently talked with someone who plays one at times.  He also sent 
pics.  Shortening the facing will emphasize the high notes and the 
baffle adds substantial edge.  He stated it retained the general link 
quality but was much more powerful, and had a lot of cut...Ive 
experimented a fair bit with baffles lately and a lot of baffle really 
alters the character of the piece in my opinion.  It kind of starts 
being more like a tame Dukoff rather than a link on steroids.  He likes 
it for certain gigs.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have seen some pictures of his pieces, and I have a Theo Wanne Link
that looks very similar (with Theo&#39;s "Michael Brecker baffle"). I have
never really given this piece enough time or tried different reeds. It
definitely still has a Link quality too it, but is much more
free-blowing and penetrating. It is not for the faint of heart. I keep
meaning to get back to it, but haven&#39;t found the time...still just
playing a stock chamber with a Wanne facing (I have been unable to
create anything superior myself...even duplicating everything as best
I can...the piece has quite a bit of chamber work; under the table is
relieved and tapered, the walls are hollowed and the chamber enlarged)
