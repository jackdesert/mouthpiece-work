            <pre class='message__body'>After almost a year of making and testing prototypes, I have completed a
saxophone artificial embouchure device. The intended purpose of this
apparatus is to conduct acoustic experiments to see what effect
introducing different variables to the instrument will have on the
harmonic spectrum and the perceived sound. It is hoped that by removing
the "human element" that one will be able to better isolate and measure
the effects that different changes make.

Some of the questions I want to pursue include:

-Does removing the lacquer from a saxophone make a difference in the
harmonic spectrum?
-Does adding weights to the neck above the tenon make a measurable
difference in the sound?
-What effect do resonators have on the sound, and what measurable

I would like to see some kind of test for repeatability as part of any trial.  Tear it down and set it up again a few times and see how the results change (if at all).  Then you can use this to determine how significant your other trials are.

            <pre class='message__body'>I bought one of these at Weiner music. I&#39;ve seen Paul&#39;s recommendations, and
read good comments elsewhere on the net, and was interested in trying one.

For the price, a very easy-playing soprano piece, but I find it has a
"narrow" sound - it seems to lack more fundamentals than some other
mouthpieces I have, not quite as full a tone.

OTOH, it certainly plays more easily up into the left-hand side-keys than
any other soprano mouthpiece I have right now.   This is a quality others
reported elsewhere, and I also find it true.

So my question, which may not be answerable except by experimentation, but
maybe someone has already tried it:

In addition to its optional spoiler, this mouthpiece features a pretty
obvious rollover baffle near the tip.  I&#39;m wondering if taking down the
rollover baffle a bit will give it a fuller sound without losing that nice
upper register response (which I&#39;m guessing/hoping has more to do with a
very successful facing curve). Any opinions?

I probably will try copying the facing curve onto another piece before
messing with the Runyon.

Hi, Barry!  Glad it is playing well for you.

As far as tone, remember that it is not how it sounds to you, but how others hear it.  Try recording from a few feet away and see what it sounds like as compared to a few other mouthpieces.  I&#39;ve had some that really fooled me.  

I was hearing an "edge" to the tone in one mouthpiece that others simply did not hear.  And another mouthpiece I thought was more "mellow" sounding was not to others.

Be careful about taking off too much of the "rollover" baffle.

Also, some look at the external size of that mouthpiece and assume it has a small chamber.  It does not. Compare it to some others and the throat is larger than some, smaller than others.  It is very much a medium chamber.

An interesting mouthpiece that will cover a lot of uses.  I think the most outstanding feature is its good intonation and great high end response with most instruments.

While it might not be the "ultimate" soprano mouthpiece, it is certainly one to play while looking for whatever it is that might suit you best.

Paul

            <pre class='message__body'>From what you described, I think you can remove some or all of the roll-over and be pleased with the sound.  I think a Custom is a great design for a contemporary sop sax sound.  I prefer a squeeze chamber design (Vandoren S25) for most of my playing but a Custom is great for wailing over a loud group.

My measurements of chamber volumes I did years ago indicate that the Custom had the smallest volume of all that I measured.  Even without the Spoiler.  But I measured to the end of the shank.  I think the Custom does not push in as far when tuned on the neck so plays with a more medium chamber volume.

In addition to the take down set up repeatability test Mojo suggested, I have another test of usefullness. What are the tone and tuning in different registers complared to a human player?

If they are not significantly different from live, you may have "Busted" the myths of voicing notes, air velocity and tongue placement in sax playing. 

If it does not sound or work as well in different registers, what is the volume of the chamber compared to an average human oral cavity when playing? (I&#39;d guess it needs to be smaller.) Then can it be remedied with a closer to human volume and more closely shaped fake tongue and roof of the mouth to encourage a similar air velocity entering the mouthpiece? WIll it have to be changed forlow to high notes, too?

You do not want to make this too good. Youtube already has videos of Toyota muscian robots!

Here is a 12th grade science fair project at the start. He gets it better, but listen to the tuning in the later songs he posts as ROBOT SAXOPHONE ARTIST.

A little interesting story about the Runyon Custom...

Lilly (at Runyon) called Santy Runyon one day, "Grover just ordered some more mouthpieces."  Every few months he call in and get some more soprano sax mouthpieces.  

Santy called him, "Grover, what&#39;s the problem?  I don&#39;t see how you can be breaking so many mouthpieces.  We make them better than that.  What&#39;s going on?"

Turns out that Grover would keep several spares in his case.  When a fan or student would come up to him and ask what mouthpiece he used, talk sax technique with him, he&#39;d reach in his case and give the saxophonist one of his mouthpieces.  Can you imagine the kick that would give to a student, "Grove Washington, Jr. gave me one of HIS mouthpieces!"  I&#39;ll bet the student would practice many hours a day after that.

Santy told Lilly, "Send Grover however many he wants."
