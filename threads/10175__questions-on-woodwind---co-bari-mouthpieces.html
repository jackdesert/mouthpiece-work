Hi Mojo,
 
I am a long standing member of your discussion group on mouthpieces, but much more as a reader than a contributor.  Today I wanted to start a new thread with a question about Woodwind & Co mouthpieces, but I found that I can&#39;t log in and the Yahoo software just keeps sending me round and round in circles !
 
Anyway, the question that I would have posted is written below.  Maybe you could post it for me or maybe you could help me to understand how I can properly sign in and start contributing.
 
Woodwind & Co Baritone Mouthpieces
 
I think that Harry Carney, amongst others, played on a Woodwind & Co ebonite baritone piece on his Conn 12M.  I bought a Woodwind Sparkle-aire B5 (made in France) piece which is OK but nothing special.  Now I have heard that Carney&#39;s piece was Woodwind & Co on NY and that these had a much bigger chamber - my French one has basically straight sides.
 
Does anyone have more information on these baritone pieces, what model Carney played and also the facing and tip details for their various models (B4 B4* B5 B5* B6 etc) ?
 
Thanks 
 
Rhys
