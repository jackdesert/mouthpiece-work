That should be close to the "facing length" of your mouthpiece.

Obviously a genius at work, I checked the sax over and sure enough, the G#
was opening just a hair. While investigating it I could see that the post
looked a bit odd. I touched it and even though it looked solid it would rock
at the touch. Time to take it in and have the post resoldered. Might as well
have it checked top to bottom. Thanks for the advice.

Check 

(1) that the octave mechanism is working properly and freely, no hesitation,
that BOTH pads (neck and body) cover as they should.

(2) that the G# pad does not crack open slighly when you finger low C, and
press any of the left pinky table keys... low G#, C#, B, Bb.

(3) that the F# pad is not propped open slightly (over adjusted) in an
effort to close the G# pad.

(4) that the "little C" pad just above the LH B key is closing fully.

(5) that the neck tenon is not leaking.

not leaking.
