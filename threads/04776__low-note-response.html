            <pre class='message__body'>As a relative newcomer to saxophone &lt;5yrs, I have been studying the 
past posts and messages and have begun to experiment with different 
facing and chamber combinations. I have run into a problem that seems 
to lead back to me and my embouchure. When I played the old C* it 
wasn&#39;t a problem but after going metal for swing band it doesn&#39;t matter 
what I do to improve the low response it works fine for about five 
minutes and then the low response gets gritty and then jumps octaves. I 
have checked for leaks and it seems OK. I have lowered the baffle and 
gone with a larger chamber and longer facing and lower reed strength 
combination and all I have accomplished is getting rid of the altissimo 
range. Is it my embouchure or is there something that I am overlooking? 
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

  Also, Selmer mouthpieces are notoriously out of spec.  If you have mouthpiece tools to measure facing length, that is, glass gauge and feelers, check the .0015" and .010" feeler readings.  The .0015" should be at least 20 mm (a reading of 40 on the Babbit and E Brand type gauges) for an alto sax, with the .010" reading 5 mm (or 10 increments) less than the .0015" reading.  
   
  I prefer a reading of 21 mm (42) for the .0015" and 16 mm (32) for the .010" feelers on alto sax mouthpieces.
   
  I have measured Selmer C* alto mouthpieces with facings as short as 16 mm (.0015" feeler).
   
  If you have no tools, do this... place the mouthpiece flat against a glass surface.  Slip a piece of 20 lb typing paper under the facing and slide back until it stops.  Make a mark with a pencil even with the tip of the mouthpiece.  Measure in mm&#39;s with a ruler from the mark to the edge of the paper.  That should be close to the "facing length" of your mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Problems with low end response can often be attributed to a leak at the neck tenon.  If the instrument is definitely sealing well everywhere else, and the problem persists, this is where I would be looking next.  Take your sax to a reputable repairer and ask them to check it out.

            <pre class='message__body'>A quick way to test for the dreaded G# problem:
 
If the horn plays low C, sustain the note and open the low C# key. If the
response diminishes, in all probability it&#39;s the G# bridge adjustment.

Obviously a genius at work, I checked the sax over and sure enough, the G#
was opening just a hair. While investigating it I could see that the post
looked a bit odd. I touched it and even though it looked solid it would rock
at the touch. Time to take it in and have the post resoldered. Might as well
have it checked top to bottom. Thanks for the advice.
