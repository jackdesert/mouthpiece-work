Most are full width at the side rails but taper to a narrower table at the
heel end.  Metal Runyons are like this.  Like you said, it is not a big
deal if everything else is OK in the piece.

A couple years ago it seemed like a lot of tenor Link STMs were made that
were narrower than standard reeds at the side rails.  I actually had to buy
a new 5* and open it up to a 7 to get the width wide enough for a client.

     I have come across places where a narrow table causes a problem with
playability. I play a handmade Dave Guardala studio piece on alto, and it
has a table that is more narrow than most reeds. With certain ligatures (I
had issues with an Olegature and a Brancher ligature, for example), it
becomes unplayable. The way the ligature tightens puts pressure on the
unsupported edges of the reed and warp it ever so slightly. The mouthpiece
becomes immediately unplayable. I have settled on a Ligaphone on that piece,
and my reed issue has gone away. I honestly don’t care if the table is a bit
narrow or not, and I don’t think it makes a difference in how it plays, but
it certainly can cause problems in some instances.

Forgive me and my newb-ish question - but, isn&#39;t having a narrower table a
good thing??? I mean, with a narrow table you can insure that the reed will
sit on the mouthpiece so that there isn&#39;t any air escaping out the sides...
I don&#39;t know - it just seems to me to be the scenario. 

 

Is the mouthpiece in question *excessively* narrow? That might be a

            <pre class='message__body'>Years ago, one of my clarinet teachers taught me to sand reeds to the
exact width of the mouthpiece, which I continue to do with all of my
sax/clarinet reeds today.  I can definitely tell the difference once
the reed is sanded to fit the mouthpiece; that extra bit hanging over
each side of the mouthpiece tends to kill the response of the reed.    
Ideally, the width of the reed should match the width of the facing -
right?

            <pre class='message__body'>Sanding the sides also makes the reed softer.  So it is tough to tell
whether the improved response is from the width matching or the softer

The biggest problem I have had is with side overhang in the bottlom lip
contact area.  This was a problem when I was blowing my brains out using a
Bari brand plastic reed on a older Level Air tenor MP.  It cut my lip.

I think matching the shape of the reed in the tip rail helps articulation. 
This probably extends into the side rails near the tip too.  But this is
just an impression.  It is really hard to test this out for a significant
difference.

As mentioned before, some ligatures may not work well with reed overhang. 
I have not had problems using Rovners with overhanging Fibracells.

            Sanding the sides also makes the reed softer.  So it is tough to tell

whether the improved response is from the width matching or the softer

reed.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, but also, the facing can be wide or narrow.  Or flare too much or
too little at the tip.

My theory is that the reed should fit the facing and tip exactly.

Of course, every brand of reed is different in width and length by
design along with the rail shape, length of cut, and so on.

Does anyone agree that it&#39;s important (I think very important) that
the reed exactly cover the side rails and tip rails with no overhang
and obviously no underhang (is that a word?)?

Care to share why or why not?

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree that ideally the reed should fit the rail, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it won&#39;t work if it doesn&#39;t. My experience has been that if the reed overhangs it acts like a harder reed, as the thinnest part of the tip is no longer in play. It is not a problem if it "underhangs" slightly, as long as the tip seals against the tip rail or the sides against the side rails, but if it "underhangs" more one starts to get response problems, since the closed cycle of the reed is no longer really closed since air can leak in in the gap between reed and rail. It&#39;s easy to test this out simply by placing the reed farther forward or backward.

  Yes, but also, the facing can be wide or narrow. Or flare too much or
  too little at the tip.

  My theory is that the reed should fit the facing and tip exactly.

  Of course, every brand of reed is different in width and length by
  design along with the rail shape, length of cut, and so on.

  Does anyone agree that it&#39;s important (I think very important) that
  the reed exactly cover the side rails and tip rails with no overhang
  and obviously no underhang (is that a word?)?

  Care to share why or why not?

Years ago, one of my clarinet teachers taught me to sand reeds to theexact width of the mouthpiece, which I continue to do with all of mysax/clarinet reeds today. I can definitely tell the difference oncethe reed is sanded to fit the mouthpiece; that extra bit hanging overeach side of the mouthpiece tends to kill the response of the reed. Ideally, the width of the reed should match the width of the facing -right?- Marco--- In MouthpieceWork@yahoogroups.com, "Paul C." &lt;tenorman1952@...> wrote:>> "Is it "normal" for the table of a tenor metal mpc to be narrower than> the reed?

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, the first reed that I sanded, was too narrow at the tip, so I
sanded one at an angle.   It fit pretty well.  I played it and it
played well for about 15 minutes before I started getting the most
terrible squeaks.

I think that I will stick to standard reeds.  They play OK.

Thanks for all of the comments,
