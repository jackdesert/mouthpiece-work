Here&#39;s how you can submit your saxophone project or idea to Neosax!

What is NeoSax?
NeoSax is a company devoted to accelerating saxophone evolution. Our mission is to help others develop their new ideas for the saxophone by making their ideas public.
During the creation phase of a new saxophone or accessory, NeoSax offers advice, manufacturing connections, and a sales outlet for inventors, designers, and others. With this, we believe that the number of new ideas for the saxophone will quickly increase.
All NeoSax.com product reviews and product demonstrations as well as the design of the new (yet-to-be-named) “NeoSax Saxophone”, are done at the MusicMedic.com Sax ProShop. The Sax ProShop is well-known for its cutting edge work in saxophone repair and often offers its service on a consulting basis to manufacturers.
What is a NeoSax Project and how do I become one?
If you have a product or a design idea for the saxophone and you need help getting ‘off the ground’, NeoSax might be able to collaborate with you in a project. It is possible that we’ll be able to help you find customers, manufacturers, or partners who can turn your ideas into a reality. If we like your idea, we’ll start a “project” based on your product. NeoSax Projects follow the design and manufacture of various products through the good and the bad, allowing everyone to watch the progress of the project.
When your project is done and you receive your first shipment, NeoSax may help sell your new product. If you have done a good amount of work to get it started and have shared some of this with us, there is likely a readership of players interested in trying your new saxophone or accessory. In this manner, we hope to garner interest in all aspects of saxophone evolution and inspire others to keep creating.
