            <pre class='message__body'>I just recently finished working on a customer&#39;s King Super 20 tenor sax
on which he wanted some extra "custom" neck work done.

He wanted to have a neck converted to use O rings instead of a cork, but
did not want to use the neck that came with his Super 20 so he bought a
used Cannonball Fat Neck to do this with.

The tenon on the neck had to be shrunk to fit the receiver on his sax
and the octave key on the neck needed to be extended to work with his
octave mechanism.

Once that was finished, play testing showed that the Cannonball neck
played considerably sharper (15-20 cents) in the upper register than the
"stock" neck---especially on the short tube notes.  I did not check the
palm key notes since they can be tuned somewhat with key heights and
crescents.  The customer was made aware up front that the new neck might
behave differently acoustically, but he insisted on doing the work
anyway in order to find out.  The specs for each neck are as follows.

Item              Fat neck      King Neck
Length                257 mm            250 mm
Volume              84 ml                 81 ml
small end          13.56 mm        12.95 mm
larger end         25.87 mm        25.83 mm
taper                   1.37 degrees   1.47 degrees


The question in my mind is whether somehow increasing the taper of the
Fat Neck by reducing the diameter of the small end would correct the
octave intonation problem.  Would there be any other solution to the
intonation problem created by the different neck?

I have long been a skeptic of "one size fits all" aftermarket necks that
are hyped by some vendors as being an improvement over the stock necks
on many different makes and models.  I would think that there are just
too many different lengths and tapers of necks on existing saxophones
for one aftermarket neck to work on all of them.  I suppose one would
need to measure and compare the specs of many different necks to know
for sure.  That might be something we could do collectively on this
forum, if others are interested.

            <pre class='message__body'>I too have always been skeptical about one-size-fits-all, at least insofar as intonation goes. You might wish to try reducing the inner diameter from about where the cork begins to the end with some sort of putty temporarily and see what that does. That would be the equivalent of "necking in",
 which is said to improve the upper register intonation.

            <pre class='message__body'>I am unfamiliar with the Cannonball Fat Neck, never having seen or  
played one. I would think that the significant difference in the  
easily measured physical dimensions would clearly indicate serious  
potential problems. I have several Super 20 necks, and all of them  
have a very uneven taper (not a straight cone), as do many necks. This  
variation in taper is often a significant part of the design and  
cannot be ignored.

We have found a tremendous variation in this taper among  
manufacturers, really more than I expected. Some are quite similar  
(Selmer and Yamaha, for example) although all have their differences.  
Rarely can you swap the neck from one brand to another and obtain  
perfect results. Length and diameter are important, but taper is  
equally so.

Altering taper "after the fact" is difficult but not impossible. If  
you are starting with a neck which is as dimensionally different as  
you describe, I would suspect it would take an awful lot of trial and  
error work (with the meter running, of course!) to find the optimum  
solution. Even then, the results may not be entirely satisfactory. Our  
shop rarely accepts this type work any more. We do some modification  
of Selmer necks, as over the years we have obtained considerable  
experience with them, but that&#39;s now about it.

I&#39;ve measured many necks, and keep a "reference stash" of most of the  
common ones on hand. When we got into the neck business, we originally  
made necks only for Selmer and compatible Yamaha models. We have now  
expanded into necks for quite a few other brands, and contrary to what  
has been reported on the internet, they are all very different from  
one another.

My suggestion is that you evaluate the taper from not a total point of  
view, but select multiple points for your measurements. I think you  
will see that the neck which gives the best results is rarely a  
straight, even cone.

This is a cut and paste from the Nation of Music Blog.

The design was Mk VI specific. We&#39;&#39;ve tried them on Selmer series II,
III, and Ref. 54, Yamaha 62 and Customs, and A Buescher Aristocrat (late
30&#39;&#39;s), and it worked perfectly on all of the above. You do have to size
the tenon for each horn, but that&#39;&#39;s not rocket science.




As an update, I&#39;&#39;ve modified the contact point of the neck octave
mechanism so that it works on more saxophones. So far, 43 different
saxophonists have tried it, al universally give it rave reviews.

With the new configuration, the neck works well on all Orpheus products
except the Steve Goodson Model (it obviously lacks the altissimo octave
pip) including Saxgourmet, Orpheo, LA Sax, LA-USA, and Vespro horns.
We&#39;&#39;ve also had good luck on some Conns and Bueschers. Unfortunately,
it&#39;&#39;s the wrong length for King Super 20&#39;&#39;s and Martins. I&#39;&#39;ve got a
Buffet SD coming in today that I&#39;&#39;ll try it on, but I have my doubts
about this application.




This is a bit confusing to me.  When the neck design first came out you
wrote that the one neck worked on many different brands.  You just
needed to resize the tenon to fit each saxophone.  Now you are claiming
that the necks are all "very different" from one another.  Do you mean
that each one has its own specific and unique taper and interior
dimensions?  Or do you just mean that you have made the tenon the same
diameter as the factory neck?  Specifically if I bought the Yamah,
Selmer, Conn, and Keilwerth necks and took detailed measurements, would
they all have unique dimensions different from each other or would they
all be the same (within manufacturing variances) except for the tenon
size?

            <pre class='message__body'>We learn as we go along, of course.....the neck design you reference  
in your post was done in 2004, and was produced until 2006. No more  
have been manufactured since then. Yes, it worked very well on many  
different saxophones, better than the original equipment. No, it was  
not and was never intended to be a perfect solution for every horn. We  
never claimed that it was, only that buyers were very happy with the  
excellent results. We sold a lot of them, and all the buyers were very  
happy. I think our approach here might best be likened to that of  
Ponzol or Oleg, who manufacture one basic model which gives improved  
results on multiple instruments.

When we began the manufacture of our own series of necks in 2008,  
after leaving Orpheus Music, we began with essentially a clean sheet  
of paper. ALL of the designs (horns, mouthpieces, and necks) were  
entirely new except for the Saxgourmet Saxello, which is the ONLY  
product carried over (we were very happy with it and it still sells  
very well). We even revised the oils, lubricants, and other products.  
The necks we manufacture today (we currently produce about a dozen  
different versions, with some sub-variations within each version) are  
brand specific, and different from one another. We do not use the "one  
size fits all, just adjust the tenon" approach.  We maintain a  
"reference stash" of examples of many different brands, and yes, they  
vary considerably from one another in length, diameter, taper, and pip  
placement. To the best of my knowledge, we are the only neck  
manufacturer who does this.

I saved this in my files to have a copy of the 8th post down in the

You must have your dates and information a bit confused.  I know how
that is.  At age 62 I forget things sometimes too.   [;)]

            <pre class='message__body'>The link I provided showed that this neck design with the "nodal
weights" was introduced in October 2007 not 2004 as you said.  The
following are cut and paste copies of Ebay ads for this same neck.

SAXGOURMET NECK  FOR YAMAHA TENOR SAXOPHONES   [Ebay ads from 9/27/08]
"This neck is specifically designed for Yamaha 62 and Custom series
tenor saxophones, and gives good results on all other Yamaha saxophones
from YTS-21 through the currently produced modles(sic). It also gives
excellent results on all models of Yanigasawa saxophones".

SAXGOURMET NECK FOR SELMER TENOR SAXOPHONES
"This neck is specifically designed for Selmer Mk VI tenor saxophones,
and gives good results on all other Selmer (Paris) saxophones from Super
Balanced Action through the currently produced Super Action and
Reference series. It also gives excellent results on the Yamaha "Custom"
series and on all models of Yanigasawa saxophones".

SAXGOURMET NECK FOR Conn 10M and 30M TENOR SAXOPHONES
"At last! An aftermarket neck designed SPECIFICALLY for the most popular
vintage tenors: the legendary Conn 10M and 30M. . . "This is NOT a
generic Asian neck with somebody&#39;s name engraved on it. As you can
plainly see, this is a very unique design, made specifically for YOUR
horn". . .
"This neck is specifically designed for Conn 10M and 30M tenor
saxophones, and gives good results on all other USA manufactured Conn
saxophones".

[Emphasis added]

Your exact words 12 months earlier describing the exact same neck  were:

"The design was Mk VI specific. We&#39;ve tried them on Selmer series II,
III, and Ref. 54, Yamaha 62 and
Customs, and A Buescher Aristocrat (late 30&#39;s), and it worked perfectly
on all of the above. You do have to
size the tenon for each horn, but that&#39;s not rocket science."

As an update, I&#39;ve modified the contact point of the neck octave
mechanism so that it works on more
saxophones. So far, 43 different saxophonists have tried it, al
universally give it rave reviews.
With the new configuration, the neck works well on all Orpheus products
except the Steve Goodson Model
(it obviously lacks the altissimo octave pip) including Saxgourmet,
Orpheo, LA Sax, LA-USA, and Vespro
horns. We&#39;ve also had good luck on some Conns and Bueschers.
Unfortunately, it&#39;s the wrong length for
King Super 20&#39;s and Martins. I&#39;ve got a Buffet SD coming in today that
I&#39;ll try it on, but I have my doubts
about this application.   [Emphasis Added]

"All you have to do is to size the tenon but that&#39;s not rocket science".

These are the facts and the timeline upon which I have based my
observations and conclusions on this topic.  "What&#39;s true is true, and
what&#39;s not is not"  as the old saying goes.

Your obsession is impressive! Keeping eBay ads indeed! You&#39;ve got  
better archives than we do! Exactly why, I am not sure.....

The ads are very clear: the necks are different and designed for  
specific instruments. Believe what you will. We&#39;ve changed all the  
product since then anyway, so this is ancient history.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Steve.  Actually a career in the field of education has taught me
to keep good records.  You never know when you will need to back up
statements that you have made that others have claimed are false.   I
have appreciated this friendly exchange about your neck designs on this
forum.  I am looking forward to many more civil discussions with you in
the future.

I hope that you can get the opportunity to try a new Cannonball
saxophone with the Fat Neck someday. They are extremely popular in our
area and I get to play and work on them all the time.

            <pre class='message__body'>It needs to be mentioned here that I have been denied membership in the acoustics forum hosted by Steve Goodson despite his statement made on the mouthpiecework forum that I would be welcome to join in the discussion.  This would not concern me except for the fact that he is attacking things I have said on this forum and prohibiting me from having the opportunity to respond.

It seems that this man&#39;s word has no meaning which is too bad.
