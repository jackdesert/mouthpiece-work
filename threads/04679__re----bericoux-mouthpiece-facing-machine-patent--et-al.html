            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Wil and M P workers.  I&#39;m glad this US patent is of interest, was  
referenced on a mouthpiece, so yes, read the fine print !  The easiest way  to search 
US patents is to have _www.USPTO.gov_ (http://www.USPTO.gov)  in your 
"favorite places", go  there, go to databases, where you can ask for specific pat #&#39;s 
OR make 2 word  [or more] searches for subject matter.  For pats before 1976, 
you&#39;ll need  the "Alterna Tiff" ?translator? and patience. I&#39;ll be glad to 
help as  needed.  If of interest, you/I/others can search farther for facing  
machines.  I&#39;ll be happy to give hints, and will explore this resource a  bit as 
well.  Luck, Don
