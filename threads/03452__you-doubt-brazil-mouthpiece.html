I&#39;m not sure what "algun" means, but as far as I know, there are not 
videos on how to rework a mouthpiece.  There are a number of pictures.

From what I hear, it is difficult to get hard rubber in the US.  I 
have not tried to find any since I primarily rework existing 
mouthpieces.  Europe is often mentioned as a source, but I do not know 
where.

Again "alguem" is a strang word to me.

Do you have facing measurement guages?  Have you tried to read the 
files and message posts on the Yahoo site?  If you do not understand 
this information I do not think you will understand again posted here.
