            <pre class='message__body'>I just got a Link Tone Edge (8*, looks to be an early Babbitt) in a horn I
bought and it has a bullet chamber (sort of a mild one, but a definite
bullet) that looks quite original. There are no other indications that the
mouthpiece has ever been refaced or modified. I&#39;ve never seen such as this.
Has anyone else? I understand that a good craftsman could modify the piece
in such a manner that the work would look original, but this looks almost
TOO good!

            <pre class='message__body'>I guess you are saying it does not look like the chamber was made using
epoxy putty.  Could you post a picture of it?
