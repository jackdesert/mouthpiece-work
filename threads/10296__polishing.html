            <pre class='message__body'>These are slightly different processes. When polishing a car you are
applying wax and then buffing the wax to a shine. If it is a cutting polish
some of the oxidised paint surface is removed by the buffing, but if it is a
gloss polish then nothing is removed except some of the applied wax. When
you burnish metal you are not applying anything, you are smoothing the metal
down to a uniformly smooth finish using finer and finer abrasives, removing
some metal in the process. This includes the process of polishing metal with
a cleaner such as Brasso, which is a combination of fine abrasive, oxalic
acid and ammonia in an oil base. This formulation varies slightly by country
to comply with local laws. The ammonia and oxalic acid serve to chemically
remove surface tarnish, the abrasive to burnish the surface.
