            <pre class='message__body'>AW, come on guys, clars belong to our musically [un]civilized world, dont let 
the 12ths/octave diff prejudice you!!  I play bass cl right beside the tenors 
in our comm. band, and on Victory at Sea, pick them up on those low C# - B 
fingerings [tough for them , easy for me!!] . I joined here to learn about 
mps, mainly for cls, which IMHO are more demanding than for saxes. Have fun,

            <pre class='message__body'>Now, Don, bass clarinet is a cool axe... the little ugly stick kicks my
tail, though.

I had not intended to insult all clarinet players, but forgot I was not
replying just to Keith.  He knows my wicked sense of humor.

            <pre class='message__body'>I really like the bass clarinet.  But I&#39;m making a floor lamp out of a

            <pre class='message__body'>OK Paul and Keith, y&#39;all are forgiven!  I&#39;ve become a devotee of the B C, 
maybe because  of its similarity to saxes.   I still believe my best 
technique was on alto [maybe even bari] sax, but not on tenor or soprano, 
never could figure out why!!!  {Eb vs  Bb ?}  Will keep eyes open , and ask 
appropriate ? s.  Don
