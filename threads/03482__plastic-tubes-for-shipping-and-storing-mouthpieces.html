            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been looking for some inexpensive tubes for shipping and storing 
mouthpieces and stumbled across these. Buying the longer ones and 
cutting them into two tubes would be cheaper without too much hassle. A 
little piece of foam stuffed into the plastic caps would keep the 
mouthpiece from rattling around.

You can also get these at any TAP Plastics store in small quantities
and diameters down to 3" with caps.

Thanks for that info. Their web site is www.tapplastics.com.

There are no stores in my area but I did notice they carry bronze 
powder. I always add bronze powder to epoxy baffles. If it is cheap 
enough, I may buy some instead of taking the time to make my own. It is 
a bit of a pain with a grinding wheel and bronze wire.
