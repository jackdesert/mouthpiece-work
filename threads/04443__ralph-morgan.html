ago he was still making mouthpieces.

Can anyone tell me if Morgan is still in business, and if so does he

Call Dave Hoskins @ (614) 920-9580 (Eastern Time Zone).  Dave is in regular touch with 
Ralph.  Keith is correct.  Both of the mouthpiece guys are Morgan disciples.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ralph is still very much in business, and staying as busy as ever.  
Ralph still does the final finish work on all the hard rubber 
mouthpieces that leave his shop.  The easiest and quickest way to get 
a Morgan piece is probably through www.junkdude.com, they keep us 
quite busy, although Ralph is still delivering to dealers worldwide.
