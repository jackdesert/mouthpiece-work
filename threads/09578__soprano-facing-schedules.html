I am starting to look into making soprano mouthpieces.  Im curious if anyone has a list of schedules for Link Sopranos at the most typical openings.  I see that there is one for a few Selmer tip openings.  It would be great if they could be sent, posted, or added to the file section.

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Phil,

Don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll help much, but I asked some people about soprano facing lengths a while back. I just looked back in my notes and will copy the info I have here from various sources:

Paul Coats: Soprano facing length: 17-18mm (34-36 on the gauge)
Mojo: Soprano facing lengths can go all the way up to 44
Morgan Fry: Soprano facing lengths 30-34

Also, for whatever it&#39;s worth, I did do a little experimenting with it myself and found that with a radial curve and a tip opening of about .065" on a Bari HR soprano mouthpiece, 36 (18mm) seemed to work well as a facing length. 

Then again, the mouthpiece I usually use on soprano is a Tenney Link HR, but the table is all messed up on it and the gauges slide way down on both sides so there&#39;s not really a way to get an accurate reading. One side of the .0015" gauge never catches at all, and the other one doesn&#39;t catch until 44 (22mm) which seems too long to me given the tip opening (about a .069"). Strangely enough though, the Tenney Link plays great even with the convex table. 

I&#39;ve also got a hard rubber piece that another refacer finished for soprano, though, that is set at 36 length and about .063" tip if that helps.

Matt
