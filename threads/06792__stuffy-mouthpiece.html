            <pre class='message__body'>Many different reasons.  Rail and tip thickness, tip opening, window size,
lay and chamber size all play into this.  They are all related to one
another and if your values are not compatible you will have problems.  You
need to reveal these dimensions before anyone can really solve this online.

Not a helpful comment, really.

Why don&#39;t you explain your own views on what kind of embouchure or breath
error might produce the impression in a player that a perfectly good
mouthpiece and reed are "stuffy." That would be useful discussion.

I think you really wanted to say, "there&#39;s no substitution for productive
practicing and mastering the instrument. Don&#39;t get too hung up on finding
the right mouthpiece. Don&#39;t let it become a holy grail."

But the right mouthpiece and a good reed make a tremendous difference.
Anybody who plays knows this.

And never mind apocryphal stories about how some famous player played an
entire concert on a terrible reed, or on a spur-of-the-moment rented plastic
saxophone, etc etc.  Yes there are giants among us.  We knew that.
