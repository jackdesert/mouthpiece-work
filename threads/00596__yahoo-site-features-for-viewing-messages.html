            <pre class='message__body'>I just noticed a couple of usefull features for viewing the older 
messages on the Mouthpiece Work Yahoo Site.

If you go to the site and click on the "Messages" area located on the 
left, you see the list of messages.  On the upper right, you have the 
option to sort the messages by "Thread".  We do not have a lot of 
threads going at the same time, but this still is a nice way of 
following the conversation.

At the upper left, there is an option to "Expand" the messages.  This 
gives you a list of messages to read (with no advertisements).  This 
is going to make my backup achiving efforts a lot easier.  I can 
sellect 15 messages at a time and paste them into a word processor 
file.

These are great features for users to use to catch up on an old topic.
