            <pre class='message__body'>Even though there are 17 members in this forum, it seems that the majority of the discussions have involved Toby, Lance, Myself, and occasionally Keith.

Some of the topics so far have been quite esoteric and possibly quite confusing to those who have not read and studied the literature as some of us have tried to do.

I would like this thread to be about anything anyone is curious about or would like to discuss at any level in the area of sound, sound production, acoustics or whatever.

If anyone uses any highfallutin&#39; scientific terms, they need to provide an easy to grasp definition of those terms in language a lay person can understand.  The other rule in this thread is that the only "dumb question" is the one that someone is afraid to ask.

If none of the self-appointed acoustics "so called experts" can answer the question, someone should be able to find a link to the best resource.
