            <pre class='message__body'>I was looking through the Alto files on this site, and I noticed all the curves posted for Meyers here are radial curves. 

 Unfortunately, I haven't measured any vintage Meyers myself, but the newer Meyers I have measured all have elliptical curves with ratios in the +5 to +9 range. (From my limited experience, Richie Coles tend to be around +6, and the regular Meyers seem to be closer to +9)
 

 Are the measurements in the files section based on actual Vintage Meyer measurements (where they traditionally radial curves)? Or are these just radial curves based on traditional tips and lay lengths?

If you are referring to the file I posted years ago, there are a number of notes within the file saying how they were generated.   They are radial curves not based on actual measurements.
