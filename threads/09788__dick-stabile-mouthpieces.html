One of the most beautiful alto sax tones was that of Al Gallodoro with a Dick 
Stabile mouthpiece.  I gave one of these mouthpiece away years back as I wanted 
to be the loudest guy in the band.   Does anyone have some info on this 
mouthpiece..... where it was made, blank,   If I wanted to find something close 
to it where should I look.  I realize this is vintage sound but it appeals to 
me.   thanks  John
