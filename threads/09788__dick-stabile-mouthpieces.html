            <pre class='message__body'>One of the most beautiful alto sax tones was that of Al Gallodoro with a Dick Stabile mouthpiece.  I gave one of these mouthpiece away years back as I wanted to be the loudest guy in the band.   Does anyone have some info on this mouthpiece..... where it was made, blank,   If I wanted to find something close to it where should I look.  I realize this is vintage sound but it appeals to me.   thanks  John
