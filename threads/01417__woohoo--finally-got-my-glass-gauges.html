            <pre class='message__body'>...so I&#39;m measuring everything in sight!

Pulled out my old Buescher bass m/p today and fixed it up. Plays 
amazingly well now (very dark, Rascher type sound but smooth response 
all the way up and down the horn.)

I&#39;ve got a few Morgans I&#39;m measuring too, as well as some nice 
Meyers, Sumners, Links and a whole pile of other stuff.
