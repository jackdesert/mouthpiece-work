The word "argument" as used in logic or debate refers to a discussion intended to persuade . It can also be defined as a series of cohesive statements leading from a premise to a conclusion.

Another more negative definition of argument is that it is a quarrel or dispute. I meant "argument" in the logical sense when I wrote that to my friend Toby since we have had many discussions on acoustics "intended to persuade" over the years on SOTW.
