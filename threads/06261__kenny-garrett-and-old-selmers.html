            <pre class='message__body'>A colleague of mine, for whom I&#39;ve refaced several mouthpieces, wants to 
duplicate Kenny Garrett&#39;s alto setup.  (He&#39;s an experienced pro and a 
great player, and doesn&#39;t expect this to magically transform him into 
Kenny Garrett...).  From what I&#39;ve been reading and hearing, that would 
be an old Selmer (short shank? scroll shank? soloist?) F or E.  I have a 
scroll shank C* and D on hand (both with "arch" shaped chambers) that 
might be good starting points, but...

1. Anyone really know what Kenny Garrett&#39;s setup is?  Model? Tip 
opening?  Refaced?
2. Scroll shank / short shank / Soloist - these terms are thrown around 
loosely sometimes; what&#39;s the difference?  I&#39;ve seen the ones with 
"Soloist" stamped on the table, and apparently some have the letter on 
the table instead of the barrel.
3. Were the tip openings larger on the older Selmers?
4. Any info on Mr. Garrett&#39;s soprano setup?  I&#39;m anticipating my 
friend&#39;s next project...
5. Any other help? - this group is truly a great source of information 
and advice.

Thanks in advance.
