            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

I&#39;m doing an article and want some really good photos of an old-fashioned tip wand.  I can take the photos, but thought that someone might already have some who is a better photographer than I.  If you already have these photos, it would be great if you&#39;d agree to share them, and, of course, I&#39;d give you photograph credit in the article.  Cheers!
