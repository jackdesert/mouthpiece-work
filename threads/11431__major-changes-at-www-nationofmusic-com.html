            <pre class='message__body'>All of this business I see on the news about websites that don&#39;t work got me scared, so I called Saxgourmet&#39;s Peoples Kommisar of Propaganda and Senior Webmeister, Melissa, and she and I spent a good portion of today fixing, adding, and improving our website. There&#39;s more to come, but here are some highlights of the visible changes you&#39;ll find:

The "Shop" menu makes it much easier to find the Saxgourmet product you&#39;re looking for

The "Special Services" menu makes some of our non-tangible products available

The "Press" menu has two sections: one with magazine articles and videos ABOUT our company, and a new section with about 40 articles I&#39;ve written and published in recent years.

The "Ask Steve" section is now back, and allows you to ask questions and share the answers with the rest of the Saxgourmet Nation…..

We&#39;ve added a FAQ section, primarily addressed toward visitors to New Orleans…..this section will be substantially enlarged in the next few days

We&#39;re re-formatting the "Artists" section (it&#39;s VERY incomplete as of today) so we can share more videos of major artists using and demonstrating Saxgourmet saxophones and products…..lot&#39;s more artists will be added in the next few days…..what&#39;s up there now is VERY incomplete, with lots of people missing…..we&#39;ll fix that in the next couple of days

We&#39;ve added links to our YouTube site, our Facebook page, our Twitter page, and our eBay store

There was a lot of "back office" work done, so everything should run much more smoothly and reliably. We&#39;ve moved our server away from Go Daddy, and obtained a new SSL certificate.

We&#39;ll be making more changes next week, as well as adding some new products. I&#39;m sorry to tell you that I anticipate some price increases effective January 1, 2014.

Please have a look at www.nationofmusic.com and let me know what you think!

In other news……I&#39;ll be contributing an article to each and every issue of the new Saxophone Today online magazine……

Sharon and I want to thank you one and all for making the recent Black Friday/Cyber Monday our most successful ever! Mouthpiece and neck sales were particularly strong, and we appreciate it!
