            <pre class='message__body'>Hi I would like to ask:

(I make reference to the dimensions external of mouthpiece for example for alto sax)

1) When and&#39; suitable a small beak, a lot of dish for example Dukoff D, Runyon Quantum?
...and when a more beak&#39; great for example Berg Larsen Metal, Bari Gold Metal?

2) What the advantages and disadvantages of a small or great beak are?

3) For big lips what and&#39; more&#39; suitable (small beak or great beak)?

The best regards, Thanks very much.
Peace
Gabriele (Italy)

I know that on the Quantum, the reason for that from Santy Runyon was 
that the more closed mouth position allowed better altissimo.  Also, the 
wanted the material to be thin and vibrate easier, and thus contribute 
more to the tone.  This is seen to be true in that the machined Delrin� 
version (the "Custom Quantum") has a much brighter tone than the metal 
version.  And it can be felt to vibrate by the player.  Other 
mouthpieces that have identical plastic and metal versions, such as the 
Runyon Metal Smoothbore vs the Runyon XL, the plastic version, the XL 
sounds much like the metal version, the Smoothbore.  These two have 
considerably thicker side walls and more material in the beak.
