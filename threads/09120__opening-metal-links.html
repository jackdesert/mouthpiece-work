            <pre class='message__body'>This is my least favorite way to open a Link.  The way I do it is just put it in a bench vice and hit it with a hammer.  You can also put a rod down the shank end and lean on it.

It takes a bit of feel to get it anywhere near right, and you have to be careful you don&#39;t twist the tip at the same time.  It always bends under the front edge of the bite plate, so you need to correct the curve afterward.  Depending on how much you move it, you may need to correct the baffle as well.  

Be careful -- I&#39;ve still got the first two of these I tried.  They&#39;re useless.

            <pre class='message__body'>Tip bending should only be considered when you have a vintage metal Link, with very little material in the tip,  that is a small size, like 4* that you want to get to a 6-7*.  Otherwise, tip cutting to open it up is a better way  to go.  

You can also consider using nylon-jawed pliers on the tip.  I have not done this to open a Link (yet) but I do use them on tips bent from a drop.

            <pre class='message__body'>i´ve only once successfully closed down a 9*metal link, that didn´t  
work at all by hammering it down to a approx. 6 then i had to redo  
the facing and ended up with 8.
my goal was a 7*.
it played perfectly, only the second measurement was too long for m  
taste(40 instead of 38)
the second time i tried the same procedure on a 10* everything, that  
was described earlier, happened: the tip bent, where the bite-plate  
started and with a second stroke i ruined the bite plate and messed  
up the whole piece :-(

when i tried to open a mpc (no name brand)with this method, the  
baffle behind the tip-rail turned out to be so high that the piece  
squeaked.
couldn´t bring it down, otherwise i would have reached the bite plate  
from the inner side.

these are some of the risks to consider, when trying this method.
besides, the metal can crack.

i´d never try it again on my precious pieces.

good luck!

Very carefully!  Seriously.  It&#39;s way too easy to twist the opening like this.  Like anything, you do enough of them and you develop a feel for it.

If you have a mill, it&#39;s much easier and safer to just bias cut the table.

Keith, thanks for providing an invaluable forum for mouthpiece work. I think mouthpiece refacing is more addictive than mouthpiece collecting! BTW, the metal reed set is a great tool. Thanks again.
