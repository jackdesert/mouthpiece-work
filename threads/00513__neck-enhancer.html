Reducing the truncation ratio should improve intonation, provided the mouthpiece is properly matched (smaller), though probably at the cost of some tonal flexibility.

            <pre class='message__body'>I read this comment about the neck enhancer on the internet the other
day and it got me wondering about the acoustics involved.

"The design of the enhancer facilitates the smooth flowing of the WAVE
(not the air) through the neck so that all the pressure nodes hit in the
exact spot desired. It is a very different principal from mouthpiece
baffles".

My understanding of pressure nodes is that they are different for each
note since the wavelengths are different for each frequency. Their
location is also pitch dependent so a note played slightly sharp would
move the "nodes" slightly toward the mouthpiece.  It makes one wonder if
the individual making that statement really understands acoustics or is
just blowing a lot of hot air.

  The nodes do not necessarily have to move to change the pitch, btw. Changing the size of the tube at the nodes affects the compliance of the air and changes pitch, but does not move the nodes. AFAIK reed effects can also change the pitch without moving the nodes, or am I wrong about that?

Seriously.  You have made such a big deal out of the effects of the "constricted opening" at the beginning of the neck.  Do you have any thoughts about how the tapered end of the "neck enhancer" would impact these effects?

            <pre class='message__body'>I think you are mistaken on that, John.  Perhaps you need to review the old postings.  I am and always have been, perfectly content with the constricted neck opening, seeing as how it is an essential element of any reed driven, conical instrument.  

Perhaps you confuse this neck constriction idea with my concern regarding the design parameters of the purely mechanical solution for attaching the mouthpiece to the instrument - the diameter of a piece of cork - determining the acoustical design parameters of the mouthpiece - the diameter of the throat.

To your question: As you have made at least as big of a deal out of the importance of the two requirements of any mouthpiece, volume and frs, surely you are equally as aware as I am, that changing the taper of the neck opening affects frs directly, and thus the tuning characteristics of the mouthpiece/horn combination.

      My favorite idea in this regard are the screw-in neck ends being produced by someone whose name escapes me at the moment. In addition to strict Frs adjustments (although very possibly related or including them) is the effect of "necking in" (which Benade mentions). It appears that reducing the
 diameter somewhat for something around the length of the cork at the neck end helps the high harmonics and the high notes. Perhaps the "neck enhancer" has something of the same effect.

        "All of the pressure nodes will shift position, if only a micron."



What would that be in cents? :)



Seriously. You have made such a big deal out of the effects of the "constricted opening" at the beginning of the neck. Do you have any thoughts about how the tapered end of the "neck enhancer" would impact these effects?

            <pre class='message__body'>Mouthpiece designs and questionable science:  Much of what goes on inside the mouthpiece is as yet, still unexplained by science, so to an extent "questionable" is all it can be isn&#39;t it?  

The dynamics of the neck are well understood however.  

If we were talking about over the counter medication, perhaps expecting that the manufacturer have a complete understanding of human physiology, exactly what the product did in the body, what the exact beneficial effects would be, what the side effects and dangers could be, how best to use it, under what conditions it&#39;s use would be helpful and, under what conditions not, and that they make this information easily accessible to the consumer, would not seem so unreasonable.  

Sure, our heath is not exactly the same thing as a saxophone neck, but if I make an uninformed $900.00 purchase in an attempt to solve a problem and later discover that just being informed would have lead me to a free or different solution - I&#39;m gonna feel sick.

I realize that volumes are altered by the enhancer both by extending the length of the neck inside the mouthpiece and by being itself inserted into the end of the neck a short distance.

My thoughts are if the volume lost inside the neck is offset by the larger tapered opening, then the setup would allow the mouthpiece to play the same pitch at the same location on the cork.  What do you think?

            <pre class='message__body'>Nederveen:  Definitely, just as changing the taper on the other side of the opening changes frs.

Offset: It is conceivable, in a case where the mouthpiece chamber is too large, and frs is characteristically too high, that using a neck enhancer would alter volume and frs exactly as needed, and to the exact degree, to match the mouthpiece optimally to the horn.  The chances of that are very small.  Otherwise, a similar mouthpiece/horn relationship could be improved or made worse, depending on the degree of the initial volume/frs imbalance.

A mouthpiece/horn relationship that was a good match or on the "too small" side of perfect, would only get worse.

            <pre class='message__body'>John, there is no larger opening. The opening is smaller in terms of volume no matter what. I doubt the elimination of the "edge" makes much difference. To create turbulence, it would have to be much sharper than it is. It certainly appears that the neck enhancer would lower frs because the point
 of constriction is smaller. Any volume lost in the mpc throat would be made up by pulling the mpc slightly off the cork. 
   
  That all being said, it would be interesting to get or make one of these gizmos and see just how much effect it actually has.

I realize that volumes are altered by the enhancer both by extending the length of the neck inside the mouthpiece and by being itself inserted into the end of the neck a short distance.

My thoughts are if the volume lost inside the neck is offset by the larger tapered opening, then the setup would allow the mouthpiece to play the same pitch at the same location on the cork. What do you think?

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s not that straight forward Toby, unless you adjust your mouthpiece to keep volume and frs matched perfectly.  As soon as frs is off, you start compromising volume (by placement) in order to get the best over-all tuning.  

From the pictures I&#39;ve seen of the enhancer, the part that protrudes into the throat, in front of the o-ring seal (about 1/4" looks like) does not fit against the mouthpiece wall.  So you get a 1/4" deep, very thin gap, the full circumference of the tube.  A thin gap traps a lot more energy than a wide gap in a high pressure area, so look to lose a few db of dynamic range and power, at least as much as was gained by eliminating the sudden diameter step.  LOL.

            <pre class='message__body'>I was discussing with Toby on another forum, the question: How low in the saxophone&#39;s pitch range does the effect of frs (the cavity resonance) go?

I came up with the answer I think.  Feel free to disagree.  

All the way to low Bb.  As Toby observed, the cavity resonance affects the shorter wavelength resonances, from say A2 up, so those notes will be the most sensitive to frs adjustments.  Those same resonances however, form mode 2, mode 3, and mode 4 (when applicable) of the longer wavelength fundamentals, below A2.  When the short wavelengths&#39; peak frequencies are lowered, it forces the formation of the long wavelength fundamental&#39;s regime at a lower, off-peak frequency.  

What does that mean?  Frs affects the pitch center of the entire instrument, even if your volume is correct.

            <pre class='message__body'>Before we get into any discussion of "frs" let&#39;s have a definition of terms so we don&#39;t go around in circles as we have done in the past.

My definition from Benade is the volume of the neck + that of the missing cone which is replicated by the "effective volume" of the mouthpiece.

This "effective volume" of the mouthpiece is greater than its geometric volume because of the added effect of the vibration of the reed and the player&#39;s oral cavity.

If we can agree on terms.  Then there can be a meaningful discussion.

            <pre class='message__body'>OK. Pardon me. We can let frs be defined as the played frequency of the mouthpiece and the entire neck as you suggest. 

Now, I just imported 100 new soprano mouthpieces and 100 new, one piece, straight sided sopranos, and I want to match one of the mouthpieces to each of the horns, but I&#39;m in a bit of a quandry.  The volume adjustment is no problem, however, by this MouthpieceWork2 definition, my mouthpiece/horn combinations don&#39;t have an frs. Maybe the Chinese manufacturer screwed up :-)  What do I do?   After some deliberation, I decided that I would be better off just dispensing with this whole frs idea, since my horns do have a cavity (Effective Mouthpiece Volume) + constriction, Helmholtz resonance, and as long as this resonance matches the theoretical resonance of the theoretical, apex to neck opening constriction length, missing cone, my upper registers will be optimally aligned.  

With the volume maintained consistently at the correct amount by cork placement, I&#39;ll adjust the mouthpiece throat diameter until the upper register has the best intonation possible.  I can then use inverse logic to deduce that since my upper register displays good intonation, the Helmholtz resonance is the correct frequency.  That&#39;s a very practical solution IMO.

So, I&#39;ll rephrase my question if I may.   How low in the saxophone&#39;s pitch range does the effect of the cavity/constriction Helmholtz resonance go?

      Before we get into any discussion of "frs" let&#39;s have a definition of terms so we don&#39;t go around in circles as we have done in the past.



My definition from Benade is the volume of the neck + that of the missing cone which is replicated by the "effective volume" of the mouthpiece.



This "effective volume" of the mouthpiece is greater than its geometric volume because of the added effect of the vibration of the reed and the player&#39;s oral cavity.



If we can agree on terms.  Then there can be a meaningful discussion.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: FRS - How Low Does It Go</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>So my turn to jump in here: The tube itself has its resonance structure.  Theoretically, if the tube is complete to the tip, that resonance  structure has integra, harmonic partials for any given tube length, and  that will not change either due to tube length or cone angle.

Now  cut the tip off and the partials are no longer harmonic; the modes are  stretched. All notes are somewhat sharpened, but higher modes are  sharpened more than lower modes, and short tube notes are sharpened more  than long tube notes. Also, as cone angle increases, the notes are  sharpened
 more, in the ways noted just above.

So now we need to  try to recreate the resonance structure of the missing conic tip with  the mouthpiece. Ideally, we would want to reproduce all the impedances  of the missing tip, not just the first couple, but this is not possible  since the shape is totally different. As Fletcher says, it is
 probably  not possible to reproduce more than the first two impedances and still  have a functioning mpc shape (given that the reed is a given size).

To  first step is to pull the modes into some sort of alignment, and this  is done, as we know, by matching the volume of the mpc with that of the  missing cone tip. 

The second match is that of frs. This means,  AFAIK, that the first resonance of the mpc matches the first resonance  of the missing conic tip.

Now think a minute; what is the  resonance of the conic tip? The tip is a complete cone, albeit very  short. That little cone has a resonance that has the wavelength twice as  long as the tube itself. I&#39;m not sure exactly what the length of the  missing tip is on an alto, but I&#39;m guessing that it
 is about 25 cm. That  means the tip would "play" a note with a 50 cm wavelength. A2 on alto  is concert C5, with a wavelength about 66 cm long.

What is the  resonance of the mpc? Well, obviously it is the resonance of the part of  the mpc that replaces the tip. That means all the volume (under the  reed and inside the mpc walls) as it is seen by the rest of the cone,  and that means with the exit diameter of the end of the neck.. That is 
 the pure case, as it were.

Of course you could go farther and say  that the frs of the mpc plus the first inch of the neck should be that  of the missing conic tip plus the first inch of neck. Or you could say  that the frs of the mpc plus the whole neck should be equal to the that  of a complete cone to a point where the
 exit diameter of the cone is  equal to the exit diameter of the neck.. 

You could even say that  the frs of the mpc plus the whole tube to the end of the bell should  equal the frs of a complete cone that has the big end the diameter of  the bell. 

The point is that at any given cone exit diameter, the  combination of the mpc plus whatever amount of cone gets you to that  diameter should be the same as a complete cone of that exit diameter.

But  the fact is, that the longer the actual amount of cone you include, the  less a mismatch of the the mpc to the missing cone tip matters, since  it becomes progressively a smaller and smaller proportion of the total  tube length. Remember that the smaller the truncation ratio, the less  the
 modes are affected by a truncation.

Obviously if the frs of  any length of cone + mpc does not match the frs of a complete cone of  the same exit diameter, there is going to be some effect on the  intonation, and just as obviously, the $64,000 question is at what point  that really becomes a problem. Lance is clearly right that a
 mismatch  must have some effect at some level for every tube length, but from what  I have read, a frs mismatch is only going to start being a problem for  notes that have around the same frequency as the frs frequency.

So this brings up an interesting point, since frs is relative to tube length as described.

Let&#39;s  say that we measure the "exxtreme frs" case, that of simply the mpc at  the neck opening. And let&#39;s say that, for the sake of argument, the frs  is quite low. What we can expect is to find notes at around that  frequency to be pulled flat. But just how much are notes lower than this 
 affected?  How about D2, for instance? 

Well, lets look at it  like this: Take a complete tube and cut it off so that the natural  resonance is that of D2. D2 is equal to concert F4. Concert F4 has a  wavelength of .974 M, so we are looking at a tube of just under half a  meter. That means that if the truncation of an alto is just about
 a  quarter of a meter, we have a mpc mounted on a tube that is another  quarter of a meter long--practically speaking just around where the palm  D tonehole is.

Because there is a fair amount of tube attached  to the mpc to act as a waveguide, the frs is not going to be anywhere  near as far off for the mpc plus tube as for the mpc alone. Since frs is  not anywhere near as flat for mpc + tube for the given note as for mpc  alone for its given note we can
 expect an frs mismatch for the mpc to be  progressively less as we add tube length to the equation.

I do  not know the math and so I cannot quantify this, but from all I have  read, an frs mismatch does not become a serious issue until the note  wavelength is around the same as the wavelength of the frs, which then  starts to exert a "pull" on the note, since it is the primary sounding 
 resonance which is being affected. 

Just as with mode stretching,  if the primary resonance is strong, that is the resonance that is going  to determine the sounding frequency for the most part, even if higher  resonances are out of line. Mode locking will ensure that the partials  are harmonic, and even if the resonances are fairly
 far off, they won&#39;t  be able to exert much influence on the regime of oscillation unless they  are either very strong or the primary resonance is weak. What will  happen is that they just won&#39;t contribute as much energy to the final  sound in their "place". 

As I explained on SOTW, this is somewhat  like a head cork adjustment in a Boehm flute, which is also a resonance  that affects playing resonances in its neighborhood. You can be quite  far out with a head cork adjustment and it still won&#39;t much affect the  first two octaves; its influence is felt
 almost exclusively in the third  octave, unless it is so far out that the third octave is mostly  unplayable.

            <pre class='message__body'>

My comparatively "simple" understanding is this:

Benade listed two requirements for a conical woodwind instrument to "play properly":

-"The equivalent volume of the reed cavity [mouthpiece] added to the mechanical volume of its staple (bocal or neck) must closely match the volume of the missing part of the cone".

-". . . matching Frs for the reed system to the to the first mode natural frequency of the cone apex itself. . . . the [instrument] will then "see" an object at its upper end whose acoustical behavior is quite similar to that of the missing apical cone".

The confusing part seems to come when Benade (p.471)discusses why it is so important that oboists and bassoonists must be so careful to get the right combination of reed [and staple]dimensions (volume of missing cone) and cane stiffness (Frs of reed and staple). A reed that is too stiff will play too high with the same interior volume.  A reed that is too soft will play too flat with the same interior volume.  

In reference to double reed players finding the correct reed stiffness and volume requirement he writes:

" . . . one must simultaneously meet two requirements:

(1) A low frequency requirement on the total equivalent volume of the reed cavity and constricted tube (e.g., the staple, bocal, or neck) associated with it.

(2) A higher frequency requirement that the joint playing frequency Frs of these two objects be properly related to the proportions of the air column. [In other words the frequency of the reed/staple, mouthpiece/neck must match that of the natural resonant frequency of the missing apical cone).

What happens when the volume of the mouthpiece and neck is correct but the player plays too high on the pitch?  The instrument sounds sharp and the player pulls the mouthpiece out farther creating a mismatch of missing cone volume.  This makes the instrument out of tune with itself creating octaves that are too wide.

What happens when the reed is too soft and the player plays too low on the pitch with the correct starting volume?  The instrument sounds flat hence the player pushes the mouthpiece on too far creating too small a volume.  This results in octaves that are too narrow.

Dalmont in his tuning study says this(quoting from Benade):

For a conical woodwind instrument to work properly, the equivalent volume of the reed . . . must closely match the volume of the missing part of the cone. The expression `work properly&#39; is to be [understood] as a minimal inharmonicity of the resonance frequencies.

My question is:  Does it need to be more complicated than this?

No, not to understand the the saxophone/mouthpiece relationship as it
should be, optimally.

However, to correctly diagnose a real, imperfect world example of a
saxophone mouthpiece mismatch,

The diagnosis would be octaves and registers that are out of tune and
notes that are not clear and do not match tone color due to
inharmonicity.

to fully understand the reasons for the particular tuning abberations
associated with each type,

The reasons would be the mouthpiece + neck not matching the volume of
the missing cone, and the player not producing the correct mouthpiece
pitch that matches the Frs (natural resonant frequency) of the
mouthpiece + neck.

for each particular saxophone size and model,

The mismatch effects are more pronounced as the size of the saxophone
gets smaller.


and to be able to realize the sequential steps required to rectify that
situation

Incrementally try different mouthpiece placements on the neck, and
playing with different mouthpiece pitches until the low (written) F# and
the F# an octave higher are in tune, and that fingering low B and
overblowing the 2nd partial (F#) without the octave key matches the
pitch of the other 2 F#&#39;s.

and to posess a firm grasp of the significance of each step and it&#39;s
results,

The significance and results  of each step are that pushing in the
mouthpiece raises the pitch by decreasing the volume inside the
mouthpiece and shortening the overall instrument, and pulling out the
mouthpiece lowers the pitch by increasing the volume inside the
mouthpiece and lengthening the overall instrument.

requires the application of those principals, plus others by the same
sources, to a level not discussed in the published literature.

Sorry Lance, I can&#39;t buy that anyone of the "amateurs"  on this forum
has the qualifications to take the understanding of acoustical
principles beyond that of Coltman, Benade, Nederveen, Dalmont, Backus,
Gilbert, et. al.

While we know we should adjust our mouthpieces, none of the experts told
us exactly how, to do it, providing a logical series of sequential steps
and a detailed, acoustical explanation of the  process, for each
characteristic instance where it is needed.

Push in, pull out, find optimum reed strength and embouchure pressure so
that instrument tunes to AD0 and is in tune with itself with regard to
all registers and octaves.   I taught this in 6th grade band.   I also
taught the best tuning procedure and sequence, and the optimal Frs for
the mouthpiece and neck for each size saxophone.  I also taught how to
tell if the reed is too hard or too soft for the mouthpiece.  That must
qualify me as an expert, does it not?   [:)]

I rest my case.   [;)]

            <pre class='message__body'>Just posted to SOTW a link to a study by Wolfe et al. about the effect of stopper position in tuning on flutes. The "dead space" between embouchure hole and stopper is very important to tuning, forming a sort of Helmholtz resonator which affects all tunings modes somewhat, but especially those
 notes in its neighborhood. Sound familiar? It is largely analogous to the famous frs of which we speak. The paper is interesting largely because it shows the false simplicity which Lance takes for gospel. 

According to Lance, as far as I understand him, if frs lowers modes around its frequency, those modes--if strong--would pull down the frequency of modes below them, in forming the most economical and efficient regime of oscillation.

This is, of course, true to some extent. However what Lance fails to take into account is the fact that--as presented in this paper--the situation is considerably more complex than this, since to (simplistically speaking) get that resonance going in a strong way, in which it can pull down the
 frequencies around it, it has to be excited. 

This is somewhat analogous to sympathetic vibration in strings, as far as I understand it: to get a sympathetic vibration going strongly, you have to excite the passive string with an input of its resonance frequency. A lower mode can excite a passive string only if, and to the extent, that it
 contains the partial of the frequency of the passive string.

So in the case of frs, it appears that lower modes do not excite its resonance in a way that it can affect them.

I freely admit that I do not understand this fully; however I do have trust in the experts who ARE experts. Lance is a kindergarderner like me, but unlike me he thinks he is a professor. If you find his arguments persuasive then by all means pay attention to what he has to say. I do not and I do
 not, except in the latter case to point out what doesn&#39;t make sense to me at my level of knowledge.

In terms of the frs question, I think it is interesting to look at Scavone&#39;s thesis. The part in question is his development of tranmission line models of two mpc designs starting on pg 82. In short, he made models of a short fat and a long thin alto mpc and tested their effects on an idealized
 bore. 

A couple if things are important to note here. First, the volumes were carefully matched to the volume of the missing conic tip. Second, the resonance frequency--analogous to frs--was not matched. In fact one would expect the frs of a short fat and long thin mpc to be different, and it is
 therefore rather interesting how this difference would or would not affect the tuning.

Third, there are neither reed effects nor embouchure variables to worry about in this test: what we have is the pure effect solely of a difference in mpc geometry (and hence only frs, as it were, since the volumes were identical).

Now have a look on pg 84 at figs 2.17 and 2.18. The first is an impedance plot of the two mpcs, If you look closely, you will see minimal, if any, frequency shift in the first 10 peaks at least; in fact, only when we get around the 15th peak do we start seeing a slight frequency shift--although
 there is a fair difference in peak amplitudes in the higher frequencies.

Looking at fig 2.18, we can see a slight difference in normalized partial ratios; with the narrow design being slightly better at short tube lengths.

Scavone&#39;s comment sums up the difference between these quite different designs:

"While the narrow mouthpiece provides better normal mode tuning for shorter air column lengths, the tuning effect of these different designs seems negligible."

He continues:

"It is likely that the mouthpiece geometries could be modified to produce better resonance alignment, though the purpose of this analysis was simply to determine any significant differences between the two designs."

So what we have is a large change in mpc geometry while maintaining a correct inner volume, minus the variables such as reed, lay and embouchure that Lance cannot control for in his experiments. And the result is that the tuning effect of the two designs is negligible.

This, in a nutshell, is why I am completely skeptical about Lance&#39;s claims.

                                    On the contrary, everyone else except you says that the frs adjustment affects notes only in its neighborhood. Perhaps there are some othe things at work that your infinite wisdom

      Just posted to SOTW a link to a study by Wolfe et al. about the effect of stopper position in tuning on flutes. The "dead space" between embouchure hole and stopper is very important to tuning, forming a sort of Helmholtz resonator which affects all tunings modes somewhat, but especially those
 notes in its neighborhood. Sound familiar? It is largely analogous to the famous frs of which we speak. The paper is interesting largely because it shows the false simplicity which Lance takes for gospel. 



According to Lance, as far as I understand him, if frs lowers modes around its frequency, those modes--if strong--would pull down the frequency of modes below them, in forming the most economical and efficient regime of oscillation.



This is, of course, true to some extent. However what Lance fails to take into account is the fact that--as presented in this paper--the situation is considerably more complex than this, since to (simplistically speaking) get that resonance going in a strong way, in which it can pull down the
 frequencies around it, it has to be excited. 



This is somewhat analogous to sympathetic vibration in strings, as far as I understand it: to get a sympathetic vibration going strongly, you have to excite the passive string with an input of its resonance frequency. A lower mode can excite a passive string only if, and to the extent, that it
 contains the partial of the frequency of the passive string.



So in the case of frs, it appears that lower modes do not excite its resonance in a way that it can affect them.



I freely admit that I do not understand this fully; however I do have trust in the experts who ARE experts. Lance is a kindergarderner like me, but unlike me he thinks he is a professor. If you find his arguments persuasive then by all means pay attention to what he has to say. I do not and I do
 not, except in the latter case to point out what doesn&#39;t make sense to me at my level of knowledge.



In terms of the frs question, I think it is interesting to look at Scavone&#39;s thesis. The part in question is his development of tranmission line models of two mpc designs starting on pg 82. In short, he made models of a short fat and a long thin alto mpc and tested their effects on an idealized
 bore. 



A couple if things are important to note here. First, the volumes were carefully matched to the volume of the missing conic tip. Second, the resonance frequency--analogous to frs--was not matched. In fact one would expect the frs of a short fat and long thin mpc to be different, and it is
 therefore rather interesting how this difference would or would not affect the tuning.



Third, there are neither reed effects nor embouchure variables to worry about in this test: what we have is the pure effect solely of a difference in mpc geometry (and hence only frs, as it were, since the volumes were identical).



Now have a look on pg 84 at figs 2.17 and 2.18. The first is an impedance plot of the two mpcs, If you look closely, you will see minimal, if any, frequency shift in the first 10 peaks at least; in fact, only when we get around the 15th peak do we start seeing a slight frequency shift--although
 there is a fair difference in peak amplitudes in the higher frequencies.



Looking at fig 2.18, we can see a slight difference in normalized partial ratios; with the narrow design being slightly better at short tube lengths.



Scavone&#39;s comment sums up the difference between these quite different designs:



"While the narrow mouthpiece provides better normal mode tuning for shorter air column lengths, the tuning effect of these different designs seems negligible."



He continues:



"It is likely that the mouthpiece geometries could be modified to produce better resonance alignment, though the purpose of this analysis was simply to determine any significant differences between the two designs."



So what we have is a large change in mpc geometry while maintaining a correct inner volume, minus the variables such as reed, lay and embouchure that Lance cannot control for in his experiments. And the result is that the tuning effect of the two designs is negligible.



This, in a nutshell, is why I am completely skeptical about Lance&#39;s claims.

            <pre class='message__body'>You can dispute the relevance to sax although I think it applies. But let&#39;s take the simple case of the cylindrical flute. An adjustment to the bore geometry causes tuning changes in the neighborhood of its resonance frequency. This is what frs does, albeit by slightly different means. Got me so
 far? I wouldn&#39;t want to daze you...
   
  According to MartinMods acoustic theory, as far as I understand it, such a change in a mode is going to affect other modes it is party to, by affecting the regime of oscillation. So let us say we have, by adjusting the head cork, an imperceptible change in the first mode, a barely perceptible
 change in the second mode, and a change of 50 cents in the third mode of a given note. 
   
  From MMat, we would expect that this head cork adjustment would sharpen mode 1 some, and sharpen mode 2 significantly, since the higher resonance peaks are all shifted up significantly. However in practice this does not happen. Why?
   
  Because, according to the paper, the effect of that extra compliance works differently for different frequencies, and this is the same as what Wolfe says in regard to a sax mouthpiece:
   
  "At wavelengths very much longer than its length, it approximates a local compliance, in parallel with the rest of the bore. At low frequencies, the effective characteristic impedance of the bore is low, so the compliance will have only a modest effect, but will lower the frequencies of the
 maxima. At higher frequencies, it may lower the parallel impedance and, at still higher frequencies, it is no longer appropriate to treat it as a simple compliance."
   
  This is not quantitative, but it does explain one thing very clearly: The effect of the mpc compliance, or the compliance at the top of a flute, does not act in a linear way, as you suggest. It acts in parallel with the bore, but not as part of the bore, and its influence and behavior are
 frequency dependent. This is why a change in flute stopper position will affect the first and second modes only slightly, and will not greatly affect the intonation until the note being played is in the neighborhood of the resonance frequency of that compliance. This is similar on both flute and
 sax.
   
  As I keep telling you, and you keep refusing to recognize--it is not as simple as you make it out to be. Whatever you might think, you are nowhere near the big leagues in acoustic knowledge, and what you lack in comprehension makes all the difference. I really wish that you would stop passing
 yourself off as some kind of expert. You are not. Full stop. Neither am I. Full stop. 
   
  Here is an interesting entry in the UNSW FAQ:
   
   In woodwinds, how do you get the higher resonances in tune? Playing the whole-tube note of let&#39;s say an oboe, presumably the partials are not perfectly harmonic because the flattening effect of the reed has greater effect on the higher frequencies. And the end correction will be different for
 the higher frequencies. And the chimneys of closed holes also affect lower and higher frequencies differently?
  That&#39;s a tricky question, involving lots of compromises, and makers have answered it by changing the shape slightly in an evolutionary way. Note that the instruments are never exactly cylinders or simple cones. The taper in the head of the flute and the volume between cork and embouchure hole
 are there to improve tuning between registers. The extra volume in the mouthpieces of saxophones compensates for the fact that they are truncated cones, rather than complete cones. 
   
  This is an honest, real-world answer. Lots of compromises.

Apples and oranges.  Try it on a saxophone.  The results will be entirely different.

  At wavelengths very much longer than its length, it approximates a local compliance,
  in parallel with the rest of the bore. At low frequencies, the effective characteristic impedance of the bore is low, so the compliance will have only a modest effect, but will lower
   he frequencies of the maxima. At higher frequencies, it may lower the parallel impedance and, at still high frequencies, nit is no longer appropriate to treat it as a simple compliance.
   
  This is analogous to the behavior of the space above the embouchure hole in the flute, according to what I have read.
