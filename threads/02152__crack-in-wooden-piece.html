            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m working on a wooden piece that has a crack in the barrel. There 
is a metal ring holding it from progressing but you can see the crack 
open as the mouthpiece warms up and gets moist from playing - then 
when it has dried out the crack has closed up again.  Is there any 
sort of glue to work into the crack or do you just leave it and hope 
the metal band keeps it from cracking further?

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: crack in wooden piece</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>When it is wet and the crack is visible you can put
deeply inside the aperture a sigaret paper all along
the crack. Wait that it is dried and put a drop of
cyanoacrylic glue (brand new it is very liquid and
penetrates deeply inside the crak.
The dried sigaret paper will capillary absorb the
glue.
That procedure will be sufficient to stabilize the
crack and vacuum tight the aperture.

            <pre class='message__body'>If the crack is small it works very well but the metal
rings for preventing the progress it is not elegant.
In the clarinet case the progressing should be blocked
in a different way.
