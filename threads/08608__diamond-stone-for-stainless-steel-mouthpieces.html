I&#39;ve had a few days to work with my EZ Lap brand stone....and am impressed.
I&#39;ve got a couple of hundred stainless steel mouthpieces (our Yellow Moon
model) on hand to experiment with, and am finding this to be a real time
saver.

 

The stone I bought is actually intended as a sharpening stone. It is about 3
by 8 inches in size, and has a different diamond abrasive on either side:
400 and 1200. It takes a little breaking in to work the surface (as
supplied) down to smoothness. This was explained in the instructions
provided. Once it is smooth, it flattens the table of a stainless steel
piece beautifully, without making your arm hurt!  While it doesn&#39;t do a
PERFECT job, it does about 90+% of the work pretty quickly. I still finish
with emery paper in order to get them up to Saxgourmet standards. The time
saving is significant, and much appreciated.

 

I have disregarded what Ferron says about diamond lapping stones, since he
cannot be trusted, and plan to purchase several more in order to build a
joint alter to the infallible Benade and Neverdeen. I am working on plans
for an artificial arm to further evaluate this product, even though an
artificial arm can never reproduce the realistic stroke of an actual
refacer.

 

My review is based on actual  hands on experience refacing mouthpieces, and
unfortunately lacks any academic or pseudo-scientific research.

I, for one, don&#39;t have a problem dealing with simultaneous discussions on various mouthpiece related topics, theoretical or practical.  If I see a subject I&#39;m not interested in, or a member who&#39;s comments I don&#39;t care to read, I just don&#39;t open the message.  The fact that such a discussion or message could exist, doesn&#39;t bother me in the least, and is certainly not worth making a derogatory comment about.

I will observe that this forum has evolved from a venue where a large number of people once posted about mouthpiece work into a venue where three people make the majority of posts about a subject that is off topic. This topic seems to attract very little interest from the other members (over a thousand). It’s fine with me, of course, and I offered (and the offer stands) to allow anyone (including Talcott) to move the discussion to a dedicated forum where saxophone acoustics would be the only topic. I could care less if the acoustic discussion continues here. It just seems to me that if this discussion is going to be ongoing and voluminous, it should have its own site. It’s up to Keith. He’s king, dictator, and absolutely in charge here. It is strictly his call.

Alternative site suggestions to continue acoustic discussions should be
limited to sites that will welcome all the current participants.  I had
previously suggested SOTW but I know understand that some of you are no
longer allowed to participate there.  That is why I more recently
suggested alt.music.saxophone.

However, I am fine with allowing the acoustic posts to continue here.  I
think they are easy enough to scan/read/delete.  Members can also
configure their membership to download all the comments in a daily
digest format so you only receive one Email a day with all the day&#39;s
messages.  You may also be able to set up Email filters to send posts
containing key words like "acoustic" or certain members names into a
special folder or your trash folder.  Yahoo mail allows this.

Members should make their preferences known in the poll I set up
yesterday.  I am not keeping count of votes made via forum posts.
As it stands now, the discussion on sax acoustics can continue.  If you
have previously stated you do not like it, please stop repeating
yourself. [emphasis added]

> I will observe that this forum has evolved from a venue where a large
number of people once posted about mouthpiece work into a venue where
three people make the majority of posts about a subject that is off
topic. This topic seems to attract very little interest from the other
members (over a thousand). Itâs fine with me, of course, and I
offered (and the offer stands) to allow anyone (including Talcott) to
move the discussion to a dedicated forum where saxophone acoustics would
be the only topic. I could care less if the acoustic discussion
continues here. It just seems to me that if this discussion is going to
be ongoing and voluminous, it should have its own site. Itâs up
to Keith. Heâs king, dictator, and absolutely in charge here. It
is strictly his call.

on various mouthpiece related topics, theoretical or practical.  If I
see a subject I&#39;m not interested in, or a member who&#39;s comments I don&#39;t
care to read, I just don&#39;t open the message.  The fact that such a
discussion or message could exist, doesn&#39;t bother me in the least, and
is certainly not worth making a derogatory comment about.
