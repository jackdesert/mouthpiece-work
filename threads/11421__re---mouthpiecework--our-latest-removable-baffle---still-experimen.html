            <pre class='message__body'>We&#39;re not selling them…..yet….we&#39;re still experimenting and learning…..it&#39;s not like you can go out and buy a book which tells you all there is to know about removable baffles…….we&#39;ll offer them for some of our own Saxgourmet mouthpieces at first….most likely the Blues Blaster and Fat Boy…..and later for mouthpieces produced by other companies……this is NOT a "one size fits all" sort of product, so a different version is necessary for a Link and a different version is necessary for a Berg…..we&#39;ve made some for various brands, and have gotten pretty good results……after a fews tries, at least…..we&#39;ll offer models that are viable from a demand/tooling cost point of view
