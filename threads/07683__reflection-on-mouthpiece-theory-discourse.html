Hi Team!



I have really found your discussion of mouthpiece theory to be
interesting

and informative. I think we all agree that there is more
information/speculation

and less real understanding about the mouthpiece than any other part of
the

instrument. Here is a layman&#39;s cent and a half.





HELMHOLTZ



Characterizing the mouthpiece as a Helmholtz resonator is unproductive.



The saxophone is not an air-column with a Helmholtz jug stuck on top.

The saxophone is a truncated-cone air-column with functional

perturbations. ***



The effect of adding a constriction ring depends on where it is relative

to the W-curves, and not depended on its effect on an imaginary
Helmholtz

resonator.

each with a different wave length, still apply - even more so, since it
all starts here. Given accurate cross-sectional volume information along
the entire length of the truncation, one could make a W curve chart that
would assist greatly in analysis of which shape where does what to which
resonance mode, of which note, pitch-wise, in every register, and how to
align resonances for optimal harmonic regime formation. I&#39;m surprised
that such mouthpiece design/analysis software is not abound yet - W
Curve Chart excel sheets anyway."



YES!



Speaking of W-curves, it would be nice to have an Excel version.

Somebody should dig out Benade&#39;s paper. I use the curves he shows

for an oboe in his "Acoustic Evolution of Wind Instruments".



Question:

He shows the curves starting at the missing apex. Do I need to start

them at the physical MP tip and shorten the waves according to length

proportional to volume?







THEORY/PRACTICE TUNING DISCREPANCY



Most of you subscribe to the following:

           "Yes, tuning in the low register is by volume,

             tuning of the high register is by length."



However, theory indicates that volume has little effect on low notes

and great effect on high notes.

        Benade: FMA page 471 and page 502

        Nederveen: Figure 27.4



What is the basis for this discrepancy?



Changing the mouthpiece position affects the relationship of the

low bore notes to the high bore notes, but moving the MP also changes

the volume. Hence, moving the mouthpiece should have different effects

on the registers.



Since volume affects frequency response, I set my chamber volume

for best partial alignment to harmonics, determined mostly by the sound,

strength and stability of the notes throughout the full range of the
instrument.





NECK CYLINDER



The cylindrical end of the neck made to accept the MP may not be

a problem. In fact, it may be acoustically necessary to compensate

for high frequency partial compression due to big tone-hole length

correction at high frequencies.

        Benade: FMA, Page 432

        Benade: Horns, Strings, and Harmony, Page 213





Frs



All of the tone holes occur below the neck, so one wants the geometry

above this point to provide an acoustic quasi-cone. The bore is nearly

conic and the conicity easy to measure; the neck is not. Therefore,

Benade, as usual, is correct.



Would like some feedback on my:

olume.xls>  CUTOFF FREQUENCY (Fc)



An alto Fc is about 850 Hz. This means, that above about midway in the
2nd

register, the tone has no harmonic support, only the fundamental. So,
above Fc

the frequency is unaffected by shape. So we don&#39;t need to talk about
high

frequencies in the MP, except for turbulence. Of course, the MP or MP

and neck alone have no cutoff frequency because there is no tone-hole
lattice.



By the way, turbulence degrades motion, DC or AC.



Benade suggests that a harmonic above Fc should be provided by player

adjustments to set the reed frequency (Fr). Isn&#39;t this technique the
opposite of

those that say the embouchure should remain fixed? Has anybody cut open
a

mouthpiece so as to measure Fr?







IMPEDANCE MATCHING



I have seen no discussion about matching the acoustic impedance of the
narrow MP

tip with the big chamber. The audio profession does it with       
Bessel curves, such

as an audio horn loudspeaker. Does a rollover baffle imply a
quasi-bessel curve?

What is a MP S-curve?







***

Fletcher refers to brass mouthpiece measurements. He shows that changing

a brass MP size has little effect on frequency. It mostly changes the

frequency of amplitude enhancement. We know that changing the sax MP

size does change the frequency. Also the Q of the sax MP Helmholtz is
very

low compared to a brass MP (Q is proportional to the square root of the

volume divided by the cube power of the constriction cross section).
Plus

the reed elastic boundary also degrades the Q. I think Fletcher is
mistaken

about the sax MP being analogous to the brass MP Helmholtz jug.

Bore perturbations have more effect on the fundamental and lower modes, than the higher modes, so one tunes lower frequencies by volume at the compression anti-node.  


The higher frequencies, being of shorter wave lengths, are more affected by tube length than are lower frequencies.  It&#39;s a matter of proportion, so the high frequencies are tuned most effectively by adjusting tube length.  


As one can not adjust length without changing volume, both must be taken into account.  One tunes then the saxophone as a whole.

The higher harmonic resonances above Fc, which one clearly sees in a spectral analysis, are still present and they are audible.  That they lie above Fc merely means that they do not supply energy to the harmonic regime.

jim responds:



I am surprised that the bassoon has a lesser truncation ratio than the sax. The angle of

conicity for the bassoon is 4 times shallower than the sax. That should put the bassoon

missing apex way out there. 

Read the Nederveen again, his writing is not always easy to follow. His "As a matter of fact, no such deviations are experienced in reality." refers to the chamber volume being zero. He then shows in the graft how that deviation is affected by increasing chamber volume. It indicates that high frequencies are much more sensitive to volume than low frequencies.

Hi Team!
  
 I have really found your discussion of mouthpiece theory to be interesting
 and informative. I think we all agree that there is more information/speculation
 and less real understanding about the mouthpiece than any other part of the 
 instrument. Here is a layman&#39;s cent and a half.
  
  
 HELMHOLTZ
  
 Characterizing the mouthpiece as a Helmholtz resonator is unproductive.
  The saxophone is not an air-column with a Helmholtz jug stuck on top.
 The saxophone is a truncated-cone air-column with functional 
 perturbations. ***


Toby: Absolutely not! The Helmholtz resonance of the mpc must match the Helmholtz resonance of the missing apical section to align the higher modes when the wavelength is shorter than 1/4 wavelength of the truncated section (in my understanding).

Here is an interesting quote from a new entry in the UNSW FAQ:

"..... woodwind instruments are not simply truncated cones. The inside the saxophone mouthpiece is not a continuation of the conical bore: there is an extra volume in the mouthpiece. Informally, we could can describe it this way: imagine a wave of air flowing up the bore towards the reed, in both
 a complete cone and a real saxophone. In the saxophone, the air arrives at the mouthpiece and starts pouring into it, gradually raising the pressure. When the pressure is high enough, it forces the air back, and a reflection has occurred. Of course, the bigger the volume of the mouthpiece, the
 longer it takes before the pressure builds up and the reflection occurs. Meanwhile, the pulse in the complete cone is completing the longer path to the end of the bore, and then its reflection occurs. (Technically, we would say that this volume is an acoustic compliance and (using a perturbation
 method due to Helmholtz) this compliance flattens all of the resonances that have a pressure antinode there.) It turns out that, if you make the volume of the mouthpiece equal to the missing volume of the cone, the frequency of the first resonance is about the same, although this approximation
 only works if the truncation is a reasonably small fraction of the total length." 

However it is a question of the behavior of the spherical wavefront, as opposed to the planar wavefront in a cylindrical instrument, which complicates matters in a cone (again IMU), in that it depends not only on length but on diameter. Short wavelengths are relatively more disturbed because the
 mpc with its incorrect shape represent more of their total length. Getting the Helmholtz resonance correct at least allows them to &#39;see&#39; a better representation of the resonance structure of the missing apex.
  
   The effect of adding a constriction ring depends on where it is relative to the W-curves, and not depended on its effect on an imaginary Helmholtz resonator.
Toby: Functionally, the entire area under the reed is a pressure antinode. So this already screws up everything at the top of the mpc. If you think of a complete cone, you will see that the very apex of the cone has to be a node, since all waves reflect from there. As you move further from the
 apex, the position of the nodes begins to spread out as a function of the wavelengths of the harmonics of the fundamental (as determined by total cone length). In the truncated cone, those positions no longer exist, since they are past the truncation point. 



There is no way to recover the missing resonance structure past the point of truncation, so all the resonances which have a node there are going to be disrupted. Most of those are too high to be of much consequence, and mode locking will pull what&#39;s left into correct harmonic alignment with the
 stronger peaks of lower resonances which will determine basic frequency of the regime of oscillation. 

But if higher notes have important partials with nodes which lie past the point of truncation, their resonances are affected (all modes are widened in a truncated cone), and this can seriously throw off the tuning, because now important and influential members of the regime of oscillation are no
 longer at correct integer intervals and exert a lot of pull on the final frequency. 

However if you match the Helmholtz resonance of the mpc compliance with that of the truncated cone, you at least have gotten the first mode resonance correct, and this is generally enough to be in the ballpark for any note which can be played, although as Dr. Joe Wolfe says, "for higher
 frequencies, all bets are off."
It is interesting to note that Scavone postulates that the long, narrow chambered mpc he tested played with more high harmonic content than a fat, short chambered one because the shape more nearly approximated the shape of the conic apex, preserving its resonance structure and thus not
 destructively interfering with the high partials. Timing is everything ;-)
In terms of W curves, for notes of lower frequency, there is not much difference in the curves in the area of the mpc, at least insofar as the stronger, lower resonances of the regime of oscillation that determine the frequency of the sounding note go.

Nederveen&#39;s chart is based entirely upon 
computations using a theoretical formula, again, as regards specifically the 
bassoon.  In the next paragraph, he qualifies this result with, "As a 
matter of fact, no such deviations are experienced in reality.  Therefore, 
mechanisms must exist which provide 
compensations. "

jim responds:
 
I am surprised that the bassoon has 
a lesser truncation ratio than the sax. The angle of
conicity for the bassoon is 4 times 
shallower than the sax. That should put the bassoon
missing apex way out 
there. 
Read the Nederveen again, his writing 
is not always easy to follow. His "As a matter of fact, no such deviations are experienced 
in reality." refers to the chamber volume being zero. He then shows in the graft how that deviation is affected by increasing chamber 
volume. It indicates that high frequencies are much more sensitive to volume than low 
frequencies.

            <pre class='message__body'>Since the metal thickness is pretty much going to be consistent, how about outside measurements minus the metal thickness? I think you can pretty well extrapolate between points if they are not too far apart (not ideal, but...). A good set of calipers should get you going. In FMA Benade has a handy-dandy formula for calculating the effective widening at closed tone holes, which is NOT the same as if the widening were at the walls.

    Hi Team!



    I have really found your discussion of mouthpiece theory to be interesting

    and informative. I think we all agree that there is more information/ speculation

    and less real understanding about the mouthpiece than any other part of the 

    instrument. Here is a layman&#39;s cent and a half.





    HELMHOLTZ



    Characterizing the mouthpiece as a Helmholtz resonator is unproductive.



    The saxophone is not an air-column with a Helmholtz jug stuck on top.

    The saxophone is a truncated-cone air-column with functional 

    perturbations. ***



    The effect of adding a constriction ring depends on where it is relative

    YES!



    Speaking of W-curves, it would be nice to have an Excel version.

    Somebody should dig out Benade&#39;s paper. I use the curves he shows

    for an oboe in his "Acoustic Evolution of Wind Instruments" . 



    Question:

    He shows the curves starting at the missing apex. Do I need to start

    them at the physical MP tip and shorten the waves according to length 

    proportional to volume? 







    THEORY/PRACTICE TUNING DISCREPANCY



    Most of you subscribe to the following:

              "Yes, tuning in the low register is by volume, 

                tuning of the high register is by length." 



    However, theory indicates that volume has little effect on low notes

    and great effect on high notes.

           Benade: FMA page 471 and page 502

           Nederveen: Figure 27.4



    What is the basis for this discrepancy?



    Changing the mouthpiece position affects the relationship of the

    low bore notes to the high bore notes, but moving the MP also changes

    the volume. Hence, moving the mouthpiece should have different effects

    on the registers.



    Since volume affects frequency response, I set my chamber volume

    for best partial alignment to harmonics, determined mostly by the sound,

    strength and stability of the notes throughout the full range of the instrument.





    NECK CYLINDER



    The cylindrical end of the neck made to accept the MP may not be 

    a problem. In fact, it may be acoustically necessary to compensate

    for high frequency partial compression due to big tone-hole length 

    correction at high frequencies.

           Benade: FMA, Page 432 

           Benade: Horns, Strings, and Harmony, Page 213 





    Frs



    All of the tone holes occur below the neck, so one wants the geometry

    above this point to provide an acoustic quasi-cone. The bore is nearly

    conic and the conicity easy to measure; the neck is not. Therefore, 

    Benade, as usual, is correct.



    Would like some feedback on my:

     CUTOFF FREQUENCY (Fc)



    An alto Fc is about 850 Hz. This means, that above about midway in the 2nd 

    register, the tone has no harmonic support, only the fundamental. So, above Fc

    the frequency is unaffected by shape. So we don&#39;t need to talk about high

    frequencies in the MP, except for turbulence. Of course, the MP or MP

    and neck alone have no cutoff frequency because there is no tone-hole lattice.



    By the way, turbulence degrades motion, DC or AC. 



    Benade suggests that a harmonic above Fc should be provided by player

    adjustments to set the reed frequency (Fr). Isn&#39;t this technique the opposite of 

    those that say the embouchure should remain fixed? Has anybody cut open a

    mouthpiece so as to measure Fr?







    IMPEDANCE MATCHING



    I have seen no discussion about matching the acoustic impedance of the narrow MP

    tip with the big chamber. The audio profession does it with        Bessel curves, such

    as an audio horn loudspeaker. Does a rollover baffle imply a quasi-bessel curve?

    What is a MP S-curve?







    ***

    Fletcher refers to brass mouthpiece measurements. He shows that changing 

    a brass MP size has little effect on frequency. It mostly changes the 

    frequency of amplitude enhancement. We know that changing the sax MP 

    size does change the frequency. Also the Q of the sax MP Helmholtz is very

    low compared to a brass MP (Q is proportional to the square root of the 

    volume divided by the cube power of the constriction cross section). Plus 

    the reed elastic boundary also degrades the Q. I think Fletcher is mistaken 

    about the sax MP being analogous to the brass MP Helmholtz jug.

            <pre class='message__body'>Just like with impedance measurements, they aren&#39;t complete unless you inclued the mouthpiece - it&#39;s part of the bore too, and as Benade points out in:

https://ccrma.stanford.edu/marl/Benade/documents/Benade-Perturbation-1985.pdf

In underlined text:  "End modifications not only stretch and shrink Pn in the main air column, they also can slide it lengthwise along it.  For this reason, end perts alter middle bore perts."

You can&#39;t measure the mouthpiece from the outside.  Neither can one measure other important bore perturbations like tube couplings, which have steps in bore diameter, gaps, ridges, etc.  Further, many vintage instruments (and it is these instruments which hold the most interest for this analysis) have been subject to years of use, abuse, and repair.  More often than not, the body tube is no longer perfectly round.

External measurments would suffice to satisfy the curious, I&#39;m sure, but to do serious alignment work a little more precision would probably be needed.

Since the metal thickness is pretty much going to 
be consistent, how about outside measurements minus the metal thickness? I think 
you can pretty well extrapolate between points if they are not too far apart 
(not ideal, but...). A good set of calipers should get you going. In FMA Benade 
has a handy-dandy formula for calculating the effective widening at closed tone 
holes, which is NOT the same as if the widening were at the walls.

First, guys, please trim your replies, quoting only what is necessary.

Back to impedance... in the real world, how does one measure impedance of the mouthpiece? or rather, the mouthpiece/reed?

And if you know the impedance, what do you do with it?

Basically, it&#39;s a way to measure the resonance peaks of an air column, for any given fingered tone.  That tells you a lot about how the instrument will play and how to adjust resonance alignment to improve things.  

Just do a search for "woodwind impedance measurement".  There are numerous publications on the different methods used, with diagrams, charts, etc.   One version used a special attachement that fit on the mouthpiece table and sealed, as if the reed were closed.  

Some guys use pulse reflectometry, to reconstruct a model of the air column.

None of the methods are perfect.

play and how to adjust resonance alignment to improve things.  

Just do a search for "woodwind impedance measurement".  There are numerous
publications on the different methods used, with diagrams, charts, etc.
One version used a special attachement that fit on the mouthpiece table and
sealed, as if the reed were closed.  

Some guys use pulse reflectometry, to reconstruct a model of the air column.

None of the methods are perfect.

Hi Toby!
This stuff is difficult to talk about without having a common nomenclature.
What is your definition of "Helmholtz resonance"? Helmholtz has his fingerprints over
most of acoustic theory, including both lumped and distributed systems. If you are
talking about a "Helmholtz Resonator", then, I would tend to understand that you are talking 
lumped, and we have the basis for a heated debate. If you are talking about Helmholtz
resonances involved in distributed systems, then I agree with you. Frs?

Our friends at UNSW do some good research and teaching. But remember they are
colleagues of Fletcher. Do you know of a source for the lumped MP outside of that
clique?

From my original:

"Since volume affects frequency response, I set my chamber volume

for best partial alignment to harmonics, determined mostly by the sound,

strength and stability of the notes throughout the full range of the instrument."



Without paying any attention to pitch and using my preferred embouchure,

I find a MP place on my neck that gives the best sound/stability over the full

note range. I then check the tuning. If I can move the MP to tune to 440 without

degrading the sound, I am done. If this doesn&#39;t work, I try a different horn.

This is a "practical application" for me. Other examples available.

    Hi Team!

    I have really found your discussion of mouthpiece theory to be interesting
    and informative. I think we all agree that there is more information/speculation
    and less real understanding about the mouthpiece than any other part of the 
    instrument. Here is a layman&#39;s cent and a half.


    HELMHOLTZ

    Characterizing the mouthpiece as a Helmholtz resonator is unproductive.
    The saxophone is not an air-column with a Helmholtz jug stuck on top.
    The saxophone is a truncated-cone air-column with functional 
    perturbations. ***


    Toby: Absolutely not! The Helmholtz resonance of the mpc must match the Helmholtz resonance of the missing apical section to align the higher modes when the wavelength is shorter than 1/4 wavelength of the truncated section (in my understanding).

    Here is an interesting quote from a new entry in the UNSW FAQ:

    "..... woodwind instruments are not simply truncated cones. The inside the saxophone mouthpiece is not a continuation of the conical bore: there is an extra volume in the mouthpiece. Informally, we could can describe it this way: imagine a wave of air flowing up the bore towards the reed, in both a complete cone and a real saxophone. In the saxophone, the air arrives at the mouthpiece and starts pouring into it, gradually raising the pressure. When the pressure is high enough, it forces the air back, and a reflection has occurred. Of course, the bigger the volume of the mouthpiece, the longer it takes before the pressure builds up and the reflection occurs. Meanwhile, the pulse in the complete cone is completing the longer path to the end of the bore, and then its reflection occurs. (Technically, we would say that this volume is an acoustic compliance and (using a perturbation method due to Helmholtz) this compliance flattens all of the resonances that have a pressure antinode there.) It turns out that, if you make the volume of the mouthpiece equal to the missing volume of the cone, the frequency of the first resonance is about the same, although this approximation only works if the truncation is a reasonably small fraction of the total length." 

    However it is a question of the behavior of the spherical wavefront, as opposed to the planar wavefront in a cylindrical instrument, which complicates matters in a cone (again IMU), in that it depends not only on length but on diameter. Short wavelengths are relatively more disturbed because the mpc with its incorrect shape represent more of their total length. Getting the Helmholtz resonance correct at least allows them to &#39;see&#39; a better representation of the resonance structure of the missing apex.


    The effect of adding a constriction ring depends on where it is relative to the W-curves, and not depended on its effect on an imaginary Helmholtz resonator.
    Toby: Functionally, the entire area under the reed is a pressure antinode. So this already screws up everything at the top of the mpc. If you think of a complete cone, you will see that the very apex of the cone has to be a node, since all waves reflect from there. As you move further from the apex, the position of the nodes begins to spread out as a function of the wavelengths of the harmonics of the fundamental (as determined by total cone length). In the truncated cone, those positions no longer exist, since they are past the truncation point. 



    There is no way to recover the missing resonance structure past the point of truncation, so all the resonances which have a node there are going to be disrupted. Most of those are too high to be of much consequence, and mode locking will pull what&#39;s left into correct harmonic alignment with the stronger peaks of lower resonances which will determine basic frequency of the regime of oscillation. 

    But if higher notes have important partials with nodes which lie past the point of truncation, their resonances are affected (all modes are widened in a truncated cone), and this can seriously throw off the tuning, because now important and influential members of the regime of oscillation are no longer at correct integer intervals and exert a lot of pull on the final frequency. 

    However if you match the Helmholtz resonance of the mpc compliance with that of the truncated cone, you at least have gotten the first mode resonance correct, and this is generally enough to be in the ballpark for any note which can be played, although as Dr. Joe Wolfe says, "for higher frequencies, all bets are off."
    It is interesting to note that Scavone postulates that the long, narrow chambered mpc he tested played with more high harmonic content than a fat, short chambered one because the shape more nearly approximated the shape of the conic apex, preserving its resonance structure and thus not destructively interfering with the high partials. Timing is everything ;-)
    In terms of W curves, for notes of lower frequency, there is not much difference in the curves in the area of the mpc, at least insofar as the stronger, lower resonances of the regime of oscillation that determine the frequency of the sounding note go.

            <pre class='message__body'>This gives important information about the "slots" in the horn, the impedance maxima for a saxophone (points of highest impedance in the tube) tell you where the horn can most easily set up a standing wave--the frequency where the horn is happiest to play for a given fingering. It also indicates how easily the harmonics can form and add stability to the note being played (there should be maxima at higher frequencies which are integer multiples of the first maximum. If they are not at the correct points, it is harder for the harmonics to sound and contribute stability, color and power to the standing wave).

The theory is that you play a frequency into the tube and see just how much power it takes to get the air moving in the tube. Each frequency will have a characteristic "impedance". In the sax, the frequencies where the impedance is highest are the ones at which the horn tends to set up a standing wave when the reed gets air moving. But this all becomes horribly complicated by the fact that it is not simply the volume of the mpc + horn that matters, but reed characteristics as well. A passive measurement won&#39;t really do the trick, although as MartinMods says, it is at least a useful roadmap to the basic characteristics of the tube.

In answer to Paul C., the impedance of the mpc alone doesn&#39;t really mean anything until it is connected to the tube, because you really have to measure the whole playing system. Really, you want to measure the whole system with a player sounding a note, but this is really not practical. 

The reason that this gets so complex is that the reed itself has a certain compliance--meaning that it effectively adds volume to the mpc, but that is variable depending on the reed strength and the embouchure. So every time you change embouchure or change reed, you are shifting the whole spectrum of tube impedances, and not in a linear manner either. Not only do you change the frequency of the sounding note, but you change the spread of the partials. So the measured impedances of the tube are only a rough guide to how it is going to play.

This is interesting for those wishing to get into this further. The folks at UNSW have posted impedance graphs for each note of the sop and tenor saxes.

http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/saxophone/

There is a link on that page to this page, which explains impedance in much greater detail:

http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/z.html

And in the top paragraph there is a link to a paper by Dickens relating to techinques of measuing acoustic impedance.

  Toby: Clique? Is Fletcher some sort of demon, plotting to corrupt musical acoustics, and JW and co. his willing henchmen? Where does Thomas Rossing fit into the clique? Is he also guilty because he co-wrote the standard book on the subject with Fletcher?

  From their book: "In order that the horn modes be as nearly harmonic as possible, it is desirable that the mouthpiece mimic the acoustic behavior of the missing apex of the cone. This can be done at two frequencies, and then fits reasonably well over the whole range. At low frequencies the matching is achieved if the internal volume of the mouthpiece is equal to that of the missing conical apex, which requires that the mouthpiece have a slightly bulbous internal shape so that it actually constitutes a sort of Helmholtz resonator. The high frequency match can then be achieved by arranging the constriction where it joins the main part of the instrument so that the Helmholtz resonance frequency of the mouthpiece is the same as the first resonance of the missing conical apex, at which it is half a wavelength long."

  From Scavone&#39;s thesis: 
  "This requirement is based on the low-frequency behavior of the structure, since a cavity is characterized by its volume in the long-wavelength limit but not by its particular shape. Further, the lowest natural frequency of the assembly should match that of the missing conical tip so that their behaviors are comparable in the vicinity of this frequency."

  Yes, this is identical to Benade&#39;s Frs.

You discuss to some length, how interesting and/or useful it is to know the location of the pressure nodes in a saxophone neck, on your website.   Why would knowing the locations of all the pressure nodes throughout the entire air column be any less so?

I understand that, just as I do measuring impedance in a speaker system, etc.  I know that it must be measured as a system, not just the mouthpiece in isolation.  I ask what Goodson asks, too... what is the application?  

Once you have this number in hand, what can you do with it?  In what way does it tell you how to alter a mouthpiece, and is that really want you want to do?

I don&#39;t understand how knowing this will help you improve a mouthpiece, or design a new mouthpiece.

Unless I misunderstand my own statements in this particular thread, all I said was, that using an impedance analysis to make detailed W-Curves charts of an entire saxophone air column is more accurate if it includes the mouthpiece.  I never said anything about using an impedance analysis to design mouthpieces.  I can only speak for my own statements however.  Maybe someone else addressed this issue.

            <pre class='message__body'>Measuring mpc impedance alone is AFAIK not only practically impossible, but it wouldn&#39;t tell you anything useful. Measuring the system as a whole gives you valuable information about where the tube tends to resonate, which tells you not only about intonation but also indicates to some extent
 (based on how far the higher frequency impedance peaks are from the integral multiples of the first peak) the virtual strength of the harmonics--stronger harmonics giving stability and ease of response to the horn. Horns that players like and which seem to play themselves are those with good
 resonance alignments.

Nederveen says: "For reed blown instruments with short holes and a sufficiently strong fundamental in the spectrum, it has been shown that the input impedances determined by calculations closely correspond to those &#39;passively&#39; (without blowing) measured and those actually blown, the latter by
 either an artificial mouth or a musician or by both." So this information can help in designing or tweaking a woodwind bore to have a good resonance structure, and having a good resonance structure translates into a horn which has good intonation and feels responsive--which "slots".

A complete cone of any angle (within a certain range determined by the characteristics of air and the need to set up a standing wave which can regenerate) will produce a full set of partials in correct harmonic relationship to the fundamental , but as soon as you truncate that cone, it throws
 those partials off: the modes (distances between peaks) are widened, and widened more the higher one goes--the whole string of peaks is "stretched", depending on the amount of truncation and cone angle. 

The job of the mpc is to "squeeze" those peaks back into correct integer relationships with the first peak by appearing to be the top of the cone. Doing this completely is impossible, since the resonance structure of the mpc is never going to match that of the missing cone apex--they are of
 completely different shape. 

But the impedance peaks in the mpc alone are so high that they don&#39;t really affect the lower modes which determine intonation (although they do obviously affect the higher modes, which help determine tone color). To do a reasonable job, the mpc must meet two conditions. For lower notes, it is
 enough for the volume of the mpc to match that of the missing conic apex. The wavelengths are long enough that the perturbation in shape at the top of the cone don&#39;t really affect them. 

As one gets higher, with shorter waves to which the mpc perturbation represents an important fraction of their length, it becomes necessary to meet a second condition--that the first resonance of the mpc be the same as that of the missing conic apex. The point where this becomes important seems to
 be when the length of the truncation is equal to or greater than 1/4 the wavelength of the sounding frequency. 

This is what Benade calls the resonance frequency Frs, and it can be changed by adjusting the diameter of the bottom opening of the mpc where the neck is inserted:  making it smaller lowers Frs and squeezes the higher modes together; making it larger widens the higher modes.

It is interesting to note that trumpet mpcs, which are inserted inside the lead pipe (instead of over the neck as in saxes) are adjusted in this way by changing the exit diameter. Unfortunately we don&#39;t really have that option--too bad the Conn microtuner did not become the standard!

Theoretically it would be possible to adjust Frs (after making sure that the internal volume is correct) by changing the diameter of the throat--even making it smaller than the diameter of the neck opening if necessary, but the necessity of tuning by moving the mpc on the cork make this
 impractical, since that constriction should always be at the end of the neck. If you made a small diameter point in the throat and then pulled the mpc off the cork to tune you would create a nasty wide perturbation at the neck end, and of course the constriction would stop you from moving the mpc
 further onto the cork to raise tuning.

Nor is tuning by changing the mpc volume completely practical, since not only does reducing volume make the sax sharper (and vice versa), it makes the higher notes sharper than lower ones (and vice versa).

The saving grace is the fact that the player can vary mpc volume (and thus intonation) by changing the bite on the reed--so actually the player is constantly making adjustments in mpc volume to be able to play the registers in tune. There is no way around this, but the point of the game is to get
 the mpc parameters as close as possible under "normal playing conditions" (quite a loaded phrase) so that those adjustments are kept to a minimum.

My two (or perhaps three) cents, though I&#39;m not sure it answers your question.

Toby

Once the air flow gets past the tip of the reed, it really doesn&#39;t do
much.  The blown air just sort of wanders down the neck, into the body,
and leaks out of the first open holes that it finds.  One needn&#39;t
concern oneself with "air flow" in the mouthpiece or horn at all
really.  The saxophone is not a wind tunnel.  

What is of utmost importance of course, is the reed generated sound
wave, which travels through the meandering air molecules in the
mouthpiece,
neck and body tube, at the speed of sound, back and forth, from one end
to the other, the amplitude and alignment of the air column resonances,
which enable
the formation of a harmonic regime for whatever note is fingered. and
the resultant standing wave which is created.  

Removing sharp edges eliminates turbulence, and that is always good.  

Excessive rounding or beveling, may cause changes in resonance alignment, and that could be good or bad, depending.

I totally agree (easy to do because it is fact, not opinion).  But this is not intuitive.  Nearly all sax players form a mental model that involves aerodynamics.  How did Adolph Sax and his contemporaries get so smart about acoustics?

I know a lot more about fluid dynamics than I do about acoustics. Because of my background, this is a semi-rant/question.   Turbulence is a fluid dynamics phenomenon.  It is also mentioned in acoustic papers, but I&#39;m not sure why.  If there is no significant fluid (air) flow, then there can be no turbulence by definition.  Not all recirculation of air flows are turbulent.  There can be laminar recirculation and transistional (nearly turbulent) recirculation.  Perhaps there is a analognous acoustic turbulence around sharp edges that is simply known as "tubulence" in the acoustic field.  But I have not come across an acoustic definition of it.  Has anyone?

            <pre class='message__body'> The air medium (molecules) does (do) vibrate, back and forth, and it is this air motion that need concern us, as far as motion is concerned.  The amount and speed of motion is directly related to the amplitude and the wavelength of any given resonance and how it combines with the other resonances forming a harmonic regime and a standing wave.  

Benade gives his formula for figuring the minimal radius of any rounded edge to avoid vibrating air turbulence in: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/marl/Benade/documents/Benade-Physics323-1977.pdf  p. 69.  and the result is a function of the longest wave length generated by the air column.  We discussed this about a year ago on Steve Goodson&#39;s repair forum.  The amount of rounding needed is a fraction of a mm, generally.  He states that microscopic variations are noticeable by the player, and my personal experience would substantiate this.

            <pre class='message__body'>Any chaotic movement of air molecules counts as turbulence. Don&#39;t forget that there is significant local movement of air molecules at displacement antinodes in the standing wave. In woodwinds, fully 99% of the energy input by the player is lost before it can become sound radiating out of the horn,
 most of it due to thermal and viscous losses at the walls, where molecules are slowed down by contact with the wall material. Any sharp edge will disrupt the orderly movement of molecules back and forth as well. This is most evident at higher dynamic levels, when the movement is more vigorous,
 and turbulence of this kind can effectively limit the maximum playing volume before the losses at the walls do so.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would characterize the change I felt as that the attack for notes got
better, easier, once I restored a bit of edge to the bottom of the window.

 I&#39;m not sure what a "stuffy edgy sound" would be, but it&#39;s not how I&#39;d
describe what I felt or got.  Attack was easier, and notes were less "tubby"
perhaps.  

My sense is that it&#39;s a change in the air movement under the reed that&#39;s at
work, somehow. The feel was similar to the results when adding baffle. The
air movement is then closer to the reed, and the transfer of energy to the
reed is more efficient.

Regarding turbulence: The air between the reed and the baffle has to be
quite turbulent.  Even with a fairly straight baffle, there&#39;s curvature at
the very tip of the baffle to set the air roiling; not to mention the motion
of the reed slapping the air - which means there is pressure rebound
traveling back up at the reed. Perhaps some turbulence at the bottom of the
window maintains a certain slap-back-pressure that would dissipate faster
otherwise.

In any case the effect seemed pretty clear though, on THIS piece. Which
doesn&#39;t prove it would have the same effect on other pieces with different
inner geometries.

One could also equally argue that the difference was in extending the window
length slightly, since that also changed. I doubt that, however.

This requires some more experimentation.

A few sharp edges may be a good thing - if one knows where to put them.

   "Any chaotic movement of air molecules counts as turbulence. Don&#39;t forget that there is significant local movement of air molecules at displacement antinodes in the standing wave."


There is significant longitudinal particle movement at displacement anti-nodes of the standing wave.   As this flow will enter any bore perturbation to some extent (up to 10% of the diameter of any closed tone hole for example - Nederveen) it is easy to see how sharp edges or a rough, uneven bore wall would result in chaotic particle movement and energy loss at these nodes.
Interestingly, at the compression anti-nodes of the standing wave, the increase in air pressure would appear to cause significant transverse particle motion if the bore provides the opportunity (expansion of a closed tone hole, weak spring on key, gaps at tenons and body couplings), as this experiment clearly demonstrates.  (Yahoo Mail insists upon inserting spaces after "." periods, even if the "insert link" button is clicked.  You will have to manually remove them for the link to work.  It&#39;s worth it.)
http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/waves/kundtosc.html#c1
The energy traps for this transverse motion at compression anti-nodes are soft porous wall surfaces (pads) and narrow gaps in the bore (tenons and poorly matched body couplings).  The narrower the gap the more the loss.
As far as mouthpieces go, the effect of sharp edges is clear.  Narrow gaps between glued-in or adjustable baffle inserts and the mouthpiece wall will cause energy loss.  The exposed cork at the end of the neck will dampen resonances as well.

So, in this example, a mouthpiece with a baffle insert might be overall less efficient in terms of absolute audio power (putting a sound-level meter out in front of the player), but it is heard and felt as "projecting" better, because it gives us more juice in the upper frequencies, even if at the expense of some lower frequencies.

            <pre class='message__body'>That&#39;s a good one.  Scavone has published one, as well as a few others.  While Frank Catalano still refers to much of what he is doing in terms of "focusing his air flow", he does then give an excellent playing demonstration of what he is talking about, in every case.

I&#39;ve taken a look at this paper... Thanks for locating  it. It&#39;s quite
technical, but some things do seem apparent.

Firstly, I don&#39;t see anything about pressure rebound (i.e. A wave bouncing
back at the reed from the baffle) discussed here. It seems to me that is
something that should occur, but I may be wrong.

Secondly, though, it appears my assumptions about turbulence under the reed
are correct. Have you noted what they had to say on p C5-560, discussing the
modulation of the volume flow through the reed channel by the oscillation of
the reed? Here they discuss the behavior of the air jet through the
mouthpiece:

"The intrinsic instability of the free jet results into a chaotic vortical
motion called turbulence. Typical for a turbulent flow is that even at high
Reynolds numbers [mathematical expression] the kinetic energy of the jet is
very efficiently dissipated by energy transfer to small vortical
structures."

So it is clear that air movement in the mouthpiece is quite turbulent.

In discussing how the reed is set in motion,  (PC-5-562), which occurs "due
to a modulation of the Bernoulli force", they note:

"After the curvature of the lay, the geometry of the baffle is the most
critical part of mouthpiece design. Not only the spectral distribution of
the sound is influenced, but also the emission facility is affected."

The paper goes on to report  that:

"when a SHARP EDGED &#39;DITCH&#39;  [caps mine] is carved just downstream of the
reed channel exit one can experience an easier attack transient."

[If one refers to illustration "C", we see a cross section of a mouthpiece
with said ditch carved just behind what I construe as the tip rail.}

I presume that said "ditch" would increase turbulence further.

Further regarding turbulence, the paragraph entitled "Turbulence and Chaos"
seems to make the point that turbulence is a necessity.

"The addition of noise to synthetic sound is necessary to obtain a
reasonable naturalness. In speech research this problem has already been
recognized, and models of turbulent noise production have been proposed."

Furthermore:  "As musical instruments are non-linear oscillator[s] they
exhibit chaotic behavior. A certain level of non-periodicity is an essentail
characteristic of musical sound... Turbulence is an important detail in a
clarinet."

Beyond my recent experience with my tenor piece&#39;s window [I was lucky not to
spoil my favorite piece!], I think the fact that many popular saxophones
mouthpieces have sharp step baffles (sure to induce a certain amount of
turbulence occurring after the reed) supports the notion that turbulence
inside the mouthpiece is not necessarily a bad thing, and a few sharp edges
are useful, if we know where to put them.

This idea that what&#39;s going in inside the mouthpiece is primarily some kind
of efficient flow (as though oil was flowing through it, and the fewer
eddies the better) may be intuitively appealing, but does not appear to be
correct.

D. Bechert failed to specify exactly what he meant by "sharp" in his personal correspondence to the author of your quoted puplication, as one doing a serious scientific study perhaps ought.  We should define "sharp" a little more precisely maybe.  

Benade claims that if the edges are sharper than the radius of the curvature .01xSQRT(250/f)mm where f is the frequency of the lowest note of the instrument, there will be undesirable turbulence.  The frequency of E3 on the clarinet (as in the quoted example above) is 147hz, so the critical radius of curvature for any edge would be .013mm.  

I doubt that one could carve turkey with such an edge, but it would still have the appearance of sharpness to the casual observer.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree. Also it is important to realize that the turbulence being referred to is simply the dissipation of the jet within the reed channel. Perhaps not generally realized, but there is a free jet formed at the reed, much like the air jet of the flute. Like any jet, it loses focus and dissipates
 into small vortices, which is exactly what needs to happen so that it does not interfere with the standing wave in the tube. This definitely does not mean that there is significant turbulence in the mpc generally. The free jet travels some way down the reed channel. The air in the mpc does not
 "roil".

The energy/effort to set the reed into motion is a function of the pressure differential across the reed. Ostensibly then, it would be easier to set the reed into motion with a low baffle, rather than a high one.

As regards a "pressure rebound". There is one. It is the reflection of the pressure wave which has hit the end of the tube, inverted, and traveled back up to the top. That is why the reed vibrates at the frequency of the tube. In saxes, there is another reflection from the point where the mpc
 meets the neck, which determines the ratio of open/closed. In the clarinet this does not exist, and the ratio is, IIRC 50/50. This is one of the reasons that the clarinet and the sax have such a different blowing feel even using the same design of reed valve.

 The paper goes on to report  that:
 
 "when a SHARP EDGED &#39;DITCH&#39;  [caps mine] is carved just downstream of the
 reed channel exit one can experience an easier attack transient."
 
 [If one refers to illustration "C", we see a cross section of a mouthpiece
 with said ditch carved just behind what I construe as the tip rail.}
 
 I presume that said "ditch" would increase turbulence further.
 
 Further regarding turbulence, the paragraph entitled "Turbulence and Chaos"
 seems to make the point that turbulence is a necessity.
 
 "The addition of noise to synthetic sound is necessary to obtain a
 reasonable naturalness. In speech research this problem has already been
 recognized, and models of turbulent noise production have been proposed."
 
 Furthermore:  "As musical instruments are non-linear oscillator[s] they
 exhibit chaotic behavior. A certain level of non-periodicity is an essentail
 characteristic of musical sound... Turbulence is an important detail in a
 clarinet."
 
 Beyond my recent experience with my tenor piece&#39;s window [I was lucky not to
 spoil my favorite piece!], I think the fact that many popular saxophones
 mouthpieces have sharp step baffles (sure to induce a certain amount of
 turbulence occurring after the reed) supports the notion that turbulence
 inside the mouthpiece is not necessarily a bad thing, and a few sharp edges
 are useful, if we know where to put them.
 
 This idea that what&#39;s going in inside the mouthpiece is primarily some kind
 of efficient flow (as though oil was flowing through it, and the fewer
 eddies the better) may be intuitively appealing, but does not appear to be
 correct.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ferron&#39;s analogy of a vibrating steel bar, clamped at one end, and the sound wave reflecting off a baffle-like surface next to it according to the laws of physics - angle of incidence = angle of reflection, is interesting, but perhaps overly simplistic, being, he left out all the things that other acousticians consider important (and the reverse is also true) - as Toby alludes to.  

Obviously the shape and angle of the baffle are of utmost importance.  One should keep in mind that the compression waves are traveling in both directions, not only originating from the reed, and that the reed is coupled between two (three on a conical bored instrument - add the mouthpiece Frs generating chamber) resonating air chambers, and forced to vibrate sympathetically  with them.  The compression waves travel partially, beyond the mouthpiece/reed, into the player&#39;s coupled, vocal tract resonator, and back.

I think that if Ferron&#39;s analogy has any real significance, it would be between the initial attack of a note, the point where the reed went from "at rest", into motion, and the point where a stable harmonic regime is established.

Ferron does mention how non-harmonic partials formed by mouthpiece surfaces and shapes can interfere with tone production efficiency.

Lance,

 I would love to hear you playing like that as it is something that I find quite difficult to do.I have a small collection of mouthpieces most of which do not permit me to play softly with ease---maybe I need a more free-blowing piece?

In reality, all one is doing is manipulating the shape of the vocal tract, our body resonating cavity in order to better align and reinforce specific coupled resonances of the instrument&#39;s air column.  "Shaping" the note is the most accurate common analogy perhaps.  

  During actual playing, we still need to simplify our mental concept of what is going on by using mental imagery, but, now that I understand what is going on a little better, the "real world" coupled resonating body cavity (vocal tract) imagery works better for me than the old inaccurate "air stream" thing.
