            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone used an acrylic monomer and polymer to repair a chipped tip? I watched Mojo's video where he uses this to fill in and replace bite plates, so I thought I'd try it on a tip. It came out great as far as I can tell. Seems solid (it holds up to a good amount of thumb pressure) and it's nice that it's black so it matches the mouthpiece. But I'm not sure how well it would hold up in the long run so I figured I'd ask you guys. I should mention that the mouthpiece is plastic. I haven't tried it on hard rubber yet. Before and after pics are attached.

            <pre class='message__body'>I tried it once and it fell off while I was shaping it.  It was a corner repair.
