            <pre class='message__body'>I have some old hard rubber mpc that have no manufacturers marks except maybe rings cut or basic design. Some look professional with narrow rails. I would like to know who made them ...

I have never found a site that has comparisons in design by different makers. Otto link yes but not other makers.

Also C-melody mpc seem hard to identify. Do these use tenor reeds or alto? What is the size of cork that they fit on or the size of shank ?

I could upload pix of the various mpc I am looking at if I can work out the upload software ...

Any suggestions ?

thanks very much
Fraser
