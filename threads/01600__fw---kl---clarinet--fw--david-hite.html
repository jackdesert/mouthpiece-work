Hi Mark,
I hope you were able to get my address off the list. It&#39;s just too many e
mails.
Salinger@udel.edu   Thanks   appreciate it.

Dear Friends:
It is with great pain that I must tell you of David Hite&#39;s passing.
He had been fighting the very rare disease, herpes simplex encephalitis
since Dec.19, and passed away in his sleep yesterday.  There are no funeral
plans, and his wife, Jean, is being well cared for in FL.  She wishes to be
kept alone with her loved ones and their grief.

I&#39;ll let you know about a possible memorial service (and concert) as soon as
I have any details.  Please understand the family&#39;s need for privacy.

With love,
John

John J. Moses
