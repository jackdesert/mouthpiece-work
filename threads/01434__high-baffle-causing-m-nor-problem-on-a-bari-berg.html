            <pre class='message__body'>I added an epoxy high-baffle to a steel 125/1 sms bari Berg.I added 
some epoxy from near the tip all the way to the bullet chamber so 
that the bullet chamber still exists,is just higher,like the whole 
baffle.

It now looks similar to a tenor Guardala King I have here but on bari 
mouthpiece.It came out nice,the Berg sounds brighter and has more 
clearer sound,much of the stuffiness of the second octave (D2 to C3) 
disappeared.

There is one minor problem though: F#,F and E (in the first octave,no 
octave key) sound a bit weird,E being the weirdest;a bit ankward to 
play and the sound thins out,especially with tighter embouchure.G1 
and up are fine,so are Eb1 and down.The funny sounds occur just on 
these three notes,F#1,F1 and E1.

I remember experiencing similar thing with a bari Lawton 8*BB I had 
for a while.Is this just because of the high-baffle and is there 
anything I could do about it? I like the brightness of this Berg with 
a baffle and really don&#39;t want to lower the baffle.Is there any other 
way to improve these three notes? 

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>What I like to do is first try some baffle ideas with temporary epoxy to
work out the best shape then put in an epoxy one.

Since you already have epoxy in it, I&#39;ll suggest how it can be changed and
if it does not work better, you&#39;ll just have to fill it back in with more
epoxy.

I think you should try taking away some baffle away from the tip, near the
bullet.  I would start with a ~1/4" round file groove down the middle. 
Angle it to create a small bullet ~1/2 long (thiis is like a Runyon Jaguar
groove.  Try it.  If it makes some improvement but not enough, widen it
some and/or lengthen it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

I made a V-shaped groove in the baffle of the Berg as you 
suggested.It is similar to a Runyon Jaguar now.It made a nice 
improvement to the tone,added some depth to it without making it 
darker (maybe a bit).It didn&#39;t really have any effect on the E,F and 
F# though but I found another solution.I was using Vandoren bluebox 
reeds on the Berg but when I switched to Rico Royal 3s or 3 1/2s,the 
problem disappeared.Quite strange but I&#39;m not complaining.Thanks for 
the tip!

            <pre class='message__body'>Not strange at all, the reed switch.  I find that Vandoren blue box 
reeds are not suitable for most of the jazz type mouthpieces I have 
tried them with.  One friend sent me an RIA metal bari piece (a quite 
nice piece, it turns out) that chirped and squeeked badly.  He sent me 
reeds, too, Vdn blue box.  I had the same trouble.  A switch to Rico, or 
Fibracell, and no problems.  People put down the old Rico orange box 
(this was originally known as the Rico Symmetricutt) but they play 
pretty well, in my opinion.  If you want to stay with Vandoren, try the 
Javas, they are more suitable for jazz mouthpieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been having a lot of trouble with blue box Vandoren reeds on 
soprano. My friend says they are hard compared to Rico Royals. I 
think I will try some other reeds myself. Thanks also for the tip..
