            <pre class='message__body'>Dear friends. Greetings again. Want you to see saxophone mouthpieces I make in marble? They are extremely delicate. They are not definitive mouthpiece,of course. Are just another step in my experimentation and study of the physics of the mouthpiece. I sincerely hope you like the pictures.
 Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Beautiful work.  Do you have photos of your work in ceramic?

As you know, marble is the metamorphic version of limestone.  Any acid (from sweat or saliva) will eat into it quickly.

Clay (terra cotta) is easy to work with, machineable when air-dried or bisque fired, and certainly stable enough when fully fired, to be good for testing prototypes.  Cutting stone is easy if you have the right tools and are familiar with it&#39;s characteristics.  

Nice work hoyendegozosan.  What have you learned about mouthpiece physics so far?
