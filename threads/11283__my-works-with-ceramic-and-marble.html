As you know, marble is the metamorphic version of limestone.  Any acid (from sweat or saliva) will eat into it quickly.

Clay (terra cotta) is easy to work with, machineable when air-dried or bisque fired, and certainly stable enough when fully fired, to be good for testing prototypes.  Cutting stone is easy if you have the right tools and are familiar with it&#39;s characteristics.  

Nice work hoyendegozosan.  What have you learned about mouthpiece physics so far?

Ceramic is fired clay and it is delicate at best with a tenuous lifespan.

I have only seen a few ceramic mouthpieces…..the ones I have seen have all been on my work bench for repair…..is there a type of ceramic which is less prone to damage?
