            <pre class='message__body'>I am about to order some Runyon Model 22 clarinet, alto, and tenor
mouthpieces.  They will have a #4 facing (clarinet-.047", alto-.066",
tenor-.078").  These are the plain jane basic student model, included
with many student instruments, stamped with such names as Conn
Precision, King, etc.

I can get them with ligature, caps, boxes, nice and pretty, ready to
sell.  BUT I am going to try to get some without, no box, no lig, no
caps, perhaps cosmetic flaws, but usable.

I am estimating a price in the $8 each range, perhaps lower.

Who wants how many, etc.  The greater the quantity, the lower the unit
price.

Write now, this is a one time offer.  Include your name and shipping
address.

Write me directly at      tenorman@...

I&#39;d like 2 for clarinet and 3 each for alto and tenor.  I see bass clarinet 
listed on Runyon&#39;s website - if I could get 2 of those that would be great, 
but since you don&#39;t list it in your email, I understand if you&#39;re not getting 
into them.  Are these plastic or hard rubber or a proprietary material?  Not 
that it matters, just curious.

            <pre class='message__body'>The material of the Runyon non metals is a proprietary plastic "alloy".
It is engineered to be much stronger than hard rubber, for a longer
lasting facing, yet it has the same "flex modulus"... meaning, it
vibrates the same as top quality hard rubber.  It is a good material to
work with.

I have your order down.

            <pre class='message__body'>OK, guys, I have a few preorders, could use some more to make it a
realistic order.  Lilly at Runyon says the more we order, the cheaper we
get them.

Let me know if you want complete "kits", mouthpiece, ligature, cap, in a
box (ready to sell), or something rougher, mouthpiece only.

These are pretty good little mouthpieces.  FYI, the alto sounds quite
good compared to a famous classical model from a European country that
shall remain nameless.  In fact, the Model 22 alto (in an ivory color)
is the one played by Charlie Parker in many of his publicity photos.
Note, no black bite insert, so it is NOT a Brillhart in some of those
photos.

These Model 22&#39;s are the same model included with the Winslow kits.

So, let&#39;s get those orders in!  I will order in the next few days.  I
need your mailing address at the same time.

Do NOT just hit reply... send your orders to me at    tenorman@...

Thanks

I&#39;ve been using Rico Graftonite&#39;s for experimentation
and have been happy (I have 2 of each sop, alto,

on the Runyons.

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t think they could be opened as large as you are looking for, but

.100.
