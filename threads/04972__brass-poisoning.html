I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of anyone getting 
poisoned by an unplated mouthpiece. Also does the patina buildup on a 
mouthpiece affect the player.

            <pre class='message__body'>Some people are alergic to brass, but there is no "brass poisoning".  Lead
poisoning could happen if the brass has lead in it, and it leaches out. 
Half of all brasses made have some lead in it to make it machinable at high
speeds.  Mouthpiece makers could easily avoid using brass with lead in it
if they want to.  Many sax players are playing on brass mouthpieces with
missing plating.  I have never heard or read of a real poisoning from a mouthpiece.

I had to coat his instrument with various materials
because the brass was leaching into his system through
the skin of his hands.
He said he could taste the brass in his mouth when he
was done playing.  And yes, the plating was good on
his mouthpiece.

A tech friend of mine was told by his doctor to start
wearing a mask because there was so much brass in his
system.

Don&#39;t you think that it should be a standard safety precaution that 
mouthpiece technicians wear a breathing mask to prevent inhalation of 
both brass and rubber dust particles?
