            <pre class='message__body'>There was a post this morning on a tuba BBS that Michael Brecker had passed.  I was 
wondering if anyone else had heard anything about this.  I knew he was sick but I checked 
the NY times website and there&#39;s no more information to be found yet.

I&#39;m hoping this is in error as I can&#39;t find any verification of it anywhere online.  I did hear 
from a reliable source that Jackie Mclean just died though.  Here is a link to that story:

Thank you for posting a source.  But this is only hearsay at this 
point.  The tuba forum source is just hearsay.  I took a quick search 
around the web and could not find any confirmation of this.  There was 
a recent post on SOTW that he was doing better and playing some.  That 
may also be hearsay.

            <pre class='message__body'> Yes, I&#39;m guessing, after realizing the date which I had not done before, that it must be a 
really awful joke of some sort.  My apologies for even making the first post as I wasn&#39;t trying 
to spread it, but I was just trying to see if anyone else could verify it because I couldn&#39;t 
believe it.  Thankfully it seems that it&#39;s untrue.
