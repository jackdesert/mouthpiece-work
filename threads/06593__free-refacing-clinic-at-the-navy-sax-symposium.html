            <pre class='message__body'>I am planning on giving a 1-hour clinic at the Sax Symposium Friday 
1/23/09 at 6PM.  The location is the on the campus of George Mason 
University located south west of Washington DC.  

Introduction to Modern Mouthpiece Refacing Techniques:

The clinic will discuss the skills needed to hand finish a 
mouthpiece.  Available literature, tools and helpful web sites will be 
listed.  Techniques will be presented on how to properly flatten the 
mouthpiece table.   A strategy will also be shown that uses a computer 
to analyze a facing curve and assist with refacing a mouthpiece to 
improve its response.

Thank you for the interest.  At this point I do not plan to video the presentation.  But I could consider doing it at a later date.
