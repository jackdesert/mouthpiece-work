Introduction to Modern Mouthpiece Refacing Techniques:

The clinic will discuss the skills needed to hand finish a 
mouthpiece.  Available literature, tools and helpful web sites will be 
listed.  Techniques will be presented on how to properly flatten the 
mouthpiece table.   A strategy will also be shown that uses a computer

improve its response.
