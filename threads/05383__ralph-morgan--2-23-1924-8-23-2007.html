For those who haven&#39;t seen this on SOTW, I want to share the
following with you.  We appreciate the outpouring of love and
support in the wake of Ralph&#39;s death.  Here&#39;s the SOTW link:

Please forgive me for having to share this bad news with you.

Legendary mouthpiece craftsman Ralph Morgan passed peacefully in his
sleep this morning. Many of you may know that Ralph had been ill for
the last two months, but this was not expected, and is a shock to
all of us. Ralph was at peace with the Lord, and we&#39;re sure he&#39;s no
longer suffering.

Please spare a thought or prayer for Ralph&#39;s wife Georgia. This
certainly does not mean the end of Morgan Mouthpieces, although
there are many questions left to be answered, and almost certainly
some changes in the business (not in the quality of the product) and
re-structuring to come.

Ralph derived great satisfaction from hand-crafting some of the
finest woodwind mouthpieces in the world. Those who knew him, and
those of us fortunate enough to learn from him, know that Ralph
lived and breathed quality craftsmanship and a dedication to the
woodwind community.

Ralph&#39;s funeral will be Monday, at Littleton and Rue Funeral Home,
830 N. Limestone, Springfield, Ohio, 45503. The phone number there
is (937) 323-6439, and cards or flowers would certainly be
appreciated.
