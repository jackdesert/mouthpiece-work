            <pre class='message__body'>Greetings,

It is with great sadness that I report to you the passing of Jerry 
Hall. Jerry was a great friend and master mouthpiece maker. I 
learned much from him. I saw him just two weeks ago at the Oklahoma 
Clarinet Symposium and, while he looked thinner than I had ever seen 
him, he looked to be in good health as he looked forward to moving 
back to Kenosha, Wisconsin. 

He was head of the woodwind division at LeBlanc for several years 
and ended his life in Birmingham, Alabama making mouthpieces and 
playing clarinet and saxophone professionally. I&#39;ll pass along any 
further information about memorial service, when I hear further.

He will surely be missed.
