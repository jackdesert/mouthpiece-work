I am looking for a Santy Runyon hard rubber clarinet  mouthpiece.  I have 
only seen one hard rubber mouthpiece by Runyon.   Santy was my first clarinet

            <pre class='message__body'>Bob, most of the Runyon non-metal mouthpieces were made of a proprietary 
blend of acrylic and synthetic rubber engineered to give the same flex modulus 
(meaning it vibrated the same) as hard rubber.  

Several lines of sax mouthpiece (no clarinet) were machined similarly to a 
metal mouthpiece but from Delrin.  Delrin has very good machining characteristics 
and vibrates similarly, too.

As far as clarinet mouthpieces, he did make a small number, perhaps a gross?... 
of hard rubber clarinet mouthpieces using Zinner blanks, but faced in his machines.

I seriously doubt you'll find one, even from the factory.
