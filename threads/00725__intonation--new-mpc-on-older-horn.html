            <pre class='message__body'>I recently got a new mouthpiece for my Conn 12M bari. It has a 
moderately,but not extremely high baffle, and it plays very well. However 
intonation is extremely sharp.  To be in tune, I have to pull out to the 
point where it falls off the neck. Is this typical of brighter mouthpieces 
on older horns? (Intonation of the 12M is not wonderful but is reasonable 
with a metal Link.) Is intonation likely to be a problem with any more 
aggressive mouthpiece I might buy? (This is a high-quality piece by a 
reputable mouthpiece maker, so I don&#39;t think quality is the issue.)

            <pre class='message__body'>Try a Lamberson, an RPC or any mpc with a medium large to large chamber.
You can used baffled mpcs but the chamber needs to be medium large to
large for the 12M to play in tune.

Later

I recently got a new mouthpiece for my Conn 12M bari. It has a 
moderately,but not extremely high baffle, and it plays very well.
However 
intonation is extremely sharp.  To be in tune, I have to pull out to the

point where it falls off the neck. Is this typical of brighter

The Runyon Quantums are one.
