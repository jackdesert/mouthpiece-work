            <pre class='message__body'>I have a question for anyone.  I have 2 L27 Brancher Mouthpieces.  
Both do the same thing.  When you first put a read on the Mouthpiece 
it plays great for the first say 20 - 30 minutes but after a while 
air begins to escape from between the read and the mouthpiece right a 
quarter of an inch on the outside of your lips.  Has anyone else had 
this problem with these mouthpieces and what can be done to correct 
it. I thought it might be that the rails were oneven but I have 
checked them it they are right on.  I am using 3.5 Java reads on them.
Any help would be appreciated....

Some use sandpaper, but I use a large mill bastard file. Just keep the tip
away from it.

In winter, with the dry relative humidity caused by heating systems, my
reeds warp if I even look at them! It can be really frustrating.

Also, some ligatures contribute to warping

          Keith and Mike are absolutely right. That is the thing that frustrates me most when using cane especially the blue box
          Vandoren reeds.   I prefer reeds with a thick heel section . I found that some reeds needs flattening about 3 times
          before producing good results.  My experience is that a good  (well designed) ligature do help a little to promote a good seal.

I have a question for anyone.  I have 2 L27 Brancher Mouthpieces.  
Both do the same thing.  When you first put a read on the Mouthpiece 
it plays great for the first say 20 - 30 minutes but after a while 
air begins to escape from between the read and the mouthpiece right a 
quarter of an inch on the outside of your lips.  Has anyone else had
