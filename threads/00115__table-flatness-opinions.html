            <pre class='message__body'>Flat or slightly concave seems to be the best way to go.  I usually 
have been trying to leave them flat, but if I think that it may be 
slightly convex (a high spot), I sometimes try sanding the belly down 
some with some sandpaper under my finger.  I leave the outside frame 
of the table as is.

I think sanding the table on glass in an "X" pattern is best for 
cuting down a table.  I then finish with lengthwise sanding.  Usually 
slowly with heavy force down to keep from rocking the piece.

Any other table cutting opinions?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the measurements on the Link. The tip area seems a little 
strange indeed, but I have had two original slant signature soprano 
mpcs that seemed to have this same tendency. I have the measurements 
somewhere, but both didn&#39;t play very well, at least for me. When I 
have some time I&#39;ll post some measurements I have collected. As I am 
in Europe (Netherlands) I have feelers in mm, so you would have 
to &#39;transpose&#39;.

When a table is very uneven - e.g. as a result of earlier attempts to 
reface - I usually do the same thing. I make a &#39;cross&#39; or a concave 
in the table, so that it rests only on the four corners of the table. 
Then it&#39;s easier to sand it down to a flat table again. Sometimes I 
don&#39;t sand it down all the way. After that the rails usually have to 
be adjusted.

BTW I am not very good in math. Some time ago I made a kind of sheet 
just like you published in the &#39;files&#39;. I remember vaguely how I got 
there, using mostly common sense. You seem to have a quick way of 
calculating &#39;arc&#39; curves. Could you please explain this to me, or 
tell me where to look?
