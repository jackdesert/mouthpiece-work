            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

I&#39;ve got a Barone tenor mpc (solid silver) contemporary. I love this
mpc, free blowing...but the finishing is not as good as other mpcs I
have, especially  the side rails : the thickness is unequal all along
the rails. Is it really important for its playability ?
I can send a picture if needed.

Thank you for your opinion !

You&#39;ll likely end up with "no lover" at all. :)

Are you kidding?  If you love it, don&#39;t try to make it better.  Chances are
you&#39;ll only ruin it.  We&#39;ve all played pieces that looked strange and uneven
that work.  Remember, you can&#39;t have it all.  Sometimes the ugliest lover is
the best!  John

            <pre class='message__body'>Uneven side rail thickness is not a big deal in any case: it may even be part of the characteristic sound of the mpc. The real important consideration is the evenness of the curve of the rails: where the reed hits, but even there, if the mpc works for you it would be better to leave it alone. If it ain&#39;t broke...
