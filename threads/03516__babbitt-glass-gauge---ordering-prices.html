ones, which read zero right at the end of the glass (marked in 1/2-mm
increments). There is a setback version as well. Also a 1/32-inch graduated
version. Note \- I was inquiring belolw about buying *two* gauges, so $20 each
(x2) + $7 shipping is the $47 quoted. One gauge would be $20+$7=$27. Yes, the
shipping is steep, but that's how they do it...  
  
This is the same price as the one I ordered last year.

In Italy their representative asked me 60 Euro (more than 72 USD) 
for "one" glass gauge and 60.50 Euro for one set of feeler gauges... 
plus shipping!!!
I coudn&#39;t belive. I will continue using my hand made glass gauge, see 
pictures in this web site (total price 2 Euro) and my set of made in 
China metric feelers gauges (2.5 Euro).

Thanks again,

... Babbitt glass gauge ordering info.  I&#39;ve become used to the "end 
grad" ones, which read zero right at the end of the glass (marked in 
1/2-mm increments).  There is a setback version as well.  Also a 1/32-
inch graduated version.  Note - I was inquiring belolw about buying 
*two* gauges, so $20 each (x2) + $7 shipping is the $47 quoted.  One 
gauge would be $20+$7=$27.  Yes, the shipping is steep, but that&#39;s how 
they do it...

Apparently, international s/h is more like $20 from Babbitt.  So I 
placed a group order back in July and mailed them out at a reduced 
cost.  There has been interest in me doing this again.

So let me know if you are interested in a glass gauge, and which 
type.  US s/h will probably be $3.50 and international $7.00.  Each 
gauge will be $20.  I&#39;ll place an order in a week or so.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Babbitt glass gauge - ordering/prices - again

From Dan T back in July:

... Babbitt glass gauge ordering info.  I&#39;ve become used to the "end 
grad" ones, which read zero right at the end of the glass (marked in 
1/2-mm increments).  There is a setback version as well.  Also a 1/32-
inch graduated version.  Note - I was inquiring belolw about buying 
*two* gauges, so $20 each (x2) + $7 shipping is the $47 quoted.  One 
gauge would be $20+$7=$27.  Yes, the shipping is steep, but that&#39;s how 
they do it...

Apparently, international s/h is more like $20 from Babbitt.  So I 
placed a group order back in July and mailed them out at a reduced 
cost.  There has been interest in me doing this again.

So let me know if you are interested in a glass gauge, and which 
type.  US s/h will probably be $3.50 and international $7.00.  Each 
gauge will be $20.  I&#39;ll place an order in a week or so.

  From Dan T back in July:

  ... Babbitt glass gauge ordering info.  I&#39;ve become used to the "end 
  grad" ones, which read zero right at the end of the glass (marked in 
  1/2-mm increments).  There is a setback version as well.  Also a 1/32-
  inch graduated version.  Note - I was inquiring belolw about buying 
  *two* gauges, so $20 each (x2) + $7 shipping is the $47 quoted.  One 
  gauge would be $20+$7=$27.  Yes, the shipping is steep, but that&#39;s how 
  they do it...

  Apparently, international s/h is more like $20 from Babbitt.  So I 
  placed a group order back in July and mailed them out at a reduced 
  cost.  There has been interest in me doing this again.

  So let me know if you are interested in a glass gauge, and which 
  type.  US s/h will probably be $3.50 and international $7.00.  Each 
  gauge will be $20.  I&#39;ll place an order in a week or so.

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Babbitt glass gauge - ordering/prices - again


  From Dan T back in July:

  ... Babbitt glass gauge ordering info.  I&#39;ve become used to the "end 
  grad" ones, which read zero right at the end of the glass (marked in 
  1/2-mm increments).  There is a setback version as well.  Also a 1/32-
  inch graduated version.  Note - I was inquiring belolw about buying 
  *two* gauges, so $20 each (x2) + $7 shipping is the $47 quoted.  One 
  gauge would be $20+$7=$27.  Yes, the shipping is steep, but that&#39;s how 
  they do it...

  Apparently, international s/h is more like $20 from Babbitt.  So I 
  placed a group order back in July and mailed them out at a reduced 
  cost.  There has been interest in me doing this again.

  So let me know if you are interested in a glass gauge, and which 
  type.  US s/h will probably be $3.50 and international $7.00.  Each 
  gauge will be $20.  I&#39;ll place an order in a week or so.
