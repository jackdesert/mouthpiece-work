            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Current Babbitt glass gauge ordering info. I've become used to the "end grad"
ones, which read zero right at the end of the glass (marked in 1/2-mm
increments). There is a setback version as well. Also a 1/32-inch graduated
version. Note \- I was inquiring belolw about buying *two* gauges, so $20 each
(x2) + $7 shipping is the $47 quoted. One gauge would be $20+$7=$27. Yes, the
shipping is steep, but that's how they do it...  
  
This is the same price as the one I ordered last year.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks a lot for these information.
In Italy their representative asked me 60 Euro (more than 72 USD) 
for "one" glass gauge and 60.50 Euro for one set of feeler gauges... 
plus shipping!!!
I coudn&#39;t belive. I will continue using my hand made glass gauge, see 
pictures in this web site (total price 2 Euro) and my set of made in 
China metric feelers gauges (2.5 Euro).

Thanks again,

Dan

End Zero guages: 

David Tan - 1
Bill Carty - 1
Daniele Luchetta - 2

I&#39;ll let you know what the total cost will be after I get them in and
determine shipping cost.

FYI, I&#39;m odering 2 set-back gauges for myself.  That totals 6 gauges and
Babbitt still only wanted $7 s/h.

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Babbitt glass gauge - ordering/prices - again


  From Dan T back in July:

  ... Babbitt glass gauge ordering info.  I&#39;ve become used to the "end 
  grad" ones, which read zero right at the end of the glass (marked in 
  1/2-mm increments).  There is a setback version as well.  Also a 1/32-
  inch graduated version.  Note - I was inquiring belolw about buying 
  *two* gauges, so $20 each (x2) + $7 shipping is the $47 quoted.  One 
  gauge would be $20+$7=$27.  Yes, the shipping is steep, but that&#39;s how 
  they do it...

  Apparently, international s/h is more like $20 from Babbitt.  So I 
  placed a group order back in July and mailed them out at a reduced 
  cost.  There has been interest in me doing this again.

  So let me know if you are interested in a glass gauge, and which 
  type.  US s/h will probably be $3.50 and international $7.00.  Each 
  gauge will be $20.  I&#39;ll place an order in a week or so.
