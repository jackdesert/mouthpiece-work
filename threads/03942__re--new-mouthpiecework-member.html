I want to welcome Jason Morris to our group.  Jason is a student at a 
nearby university and a friend of mine.

He inquired about getting a "kit" of tools needed.  We have good links 
for tools right here on our home page. 

Welcome aboard, Jason!

Other news... I am presently making a batch (all already sold!!!) of ... 
no, I am not kidding... Contrabass Sarrusaphone mouthpieces.  Really.  
Whouda thunkit?   I&#39;ll be taking photos of the entire process and 
bassoonist/saxophonist/repairman Chad Taylor and I will have a write up 
about it.
