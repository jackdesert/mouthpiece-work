            <pre class='message__body'>I have seen and read some of the messages here about garbled text, my gutt feeling is that the problem will either exist on the third party webserver, or on your local smtp server.  The POP3 Collector does not change the headers or encode types.  It just converts an email to a mime object and sends it out.  So the only occasion where an email could get modified is when the email is not properly formatted and gets corrupted during conversion to mime.
In all other cases (where content looked different), issues were caused by third party smtp servers.

I prefer to avoid composing software and/or rich text formatting that others might not be able to view as I intended.  Using the Yahoo site to compose messages or Yahoo mail works for me and I&#39;m sure there are other ways to do this.  There seems to be only a few ways that do not work on both ends.  But it is also not that big of a deal to read around a few garbled punctuations.   The biggest problem is that a simple apostrophe come through as â€™ .
