            <pre class='message__body'>I have seen and read some of the messages here about garbled text, my gutt feeling is that the problem will either exist on the third party webserver, or on your local smtp server.  The POP3 Collector does not change the headers or encode types.  It just converts an email to a mime object and sends it out.  So the only occasion where an email could get modified is when the email is not properly formatted and gets corrupted during conversion to mime.
In all other cases (where content looked different), issues were caused by third party smtp servers.

            <pre class='message__body'>The text is not garbled.  Some of the punctuation does not come through as intended.  Steve if you visit the Yahoo Group site, you can see how your posts are being formatted and saved for eternity.  I have no way of upgrading the Yahoo site to fix what is going on.  It only has been going on for a few months since you started using the larger italics purple font..  Your older posts are more readable.

I prefer to avoid composing software and/or rich text formatting that others might not be able to view as I intended.  Using the Yahoo site to compose messages or Yahoo mail works for me and I&#39;m sure there are other ways to do this.  There seems to be only a few ways that do not work on both ends.  But it is also not that big of a deal to read around a few garbled punctuations.   The biggest problem is that a simple apostrophe come through as â€™ .

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith is right: it&#39;s largely or exclusively a punctuation issue. FWIW, I get the gobbledygook on the web posts as well as the email digest. If you post on the web, the Rich-Text editor should work, right Keith? JT
