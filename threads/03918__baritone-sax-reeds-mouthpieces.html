            <pre class='message__body'>Hey guys and girls:

Good to be back after a long absence. A question. I am going to start 
play some more Bari sax.  For mellower stuff like pit work I have an 
old Selmer rubber C*, and a slant sig rubber Link (with about a 110 tip 
opening) for jazz.

Would you all mind sharing what kinds of reeds you might use on similar 
mouthpieces because I need an "upgrade" from the  3 1/2 Ricos I am 
using and Hemkes seem to get soft a bit too easily.   synthetics do not 
seem to wotk too good either.   

Also, I was thinking about opening the C* to a D or so. Antone have a 
decent facing curve for that?

Thanks,

Bob

Length	48.0
Tip Rail	0.030
Tip	0.083
	
F	L	
0.0015	48.0
0.005	41.9
0.010	36.4
0.016	31.3
0.024	25.9
0.035	19.8
0.050	12.9
0.063	7.8
0.078	2.4

I think Selmer may measure to the very tip, but this .083" is to the 
inside of the tip rail.  I think they also list facing lengths that 
are to the tangent of the table and the start of the facing curve.  
I have a chart that says bari facing lengths are 28 mm = 56.  This 
is really long for such a close tip.

You may like a longer facing curve than 48.  If you have Excell 
skills, all you need to do is edit one of the spreadsheets in the 
file section for tip and length and run the solver.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have found that Plasticovers are my choice for everything 
bari...mostly on Link STMs, but they work on my Lamberson SB and 
other higher baffle pieces. Best tradeoff between the 
volume/penetration of synthetics with the richness of reed IMHO.

Thank you. That is something I have not considered but
sounds well worth investigating.
