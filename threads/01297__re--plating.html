Thanks for your procedure.  How long do you put a piece in plating solution?

Seriously, these chemicals, as are many of ones in the utility room, and 
under the sink in the kitchen, dangerous.  Make sure you wear rubber 
gloves and apron, and eye protection.  The room should be well 
ventilated, but you don&#39;t want the big bug blower type, stirring up dust.

Also, some of the stuff we use in our shops these days, a carbon filter

            <pre class='message__body'>I had a nice recent experiance with Anderson plating (Link on the 
MPWork Yahoo site).  I sent them a Link STM I refaced for a client 
who wanted it plated in Silver.  Half of the original plating was 
missing when I got it from the client.  There were some minor 
scratches on it.  I made contact with Anderson via Email.  They 
called me the next day with some estimated prices.  They also 
confirmed that they do all of Babbitt&#39;s plating and Babbitt was just 
down the street from them.   Since I only had one piece to send them, 
it fell under their $25 min level.  Return s/h brought it up to about 
$32.  It is easiest to send them the MP and a phone number.  They 
will then call you for your credit card number when they have the 
final cost.

I decided to have them strip off the remaining plating, buff it, and 
Silver plate it.  I reminded them not to buff the rail edges.  The 
job still fell under the $25 min!

The job came back nice.  A few minor scratches were plated over that 
did not come out during the buffing.  Next time I will sand these 
areas lightly myself.  The chamber was a little blotchy but fine for 
an interior.  The facing curve came back nice and even.  

I&#39;m sorry I waited so long to try them out.  

*********************

I&#39;ve worked on several metal Barones, but on a recent one I really 
looked at the plating edges as I was reworking some surfaces.  It 
appears that there is no silver layer under the gold.  I did not see 
copper either but this may be too thin for me to see.  So it appears 
that gold does indeed plate to brass without a silver or nickel layer 
under it.  The color is more of a honey shade of gold.

I use the Casswell Brush Plating system for doing my Links.
If you get a very good polish shine up before you apply the plating, you can get excellent results. It also seals the mouthpiece.
Here is a picture of my current Link after I plated it.

solutions. This was a major factor in my choosing the Caswell Plug 'n' Plate -
I don't do a ton of plating, and it would be hard to set up the proper
ventilation, etc. for my little office workbench.

I do not know for sure, but I think cyanide plating processes has been regulated to extinction in the US.  
 
I do some brush plating for touch-up work.  But I do not feel comfortable enough with it for doing an entire mouthpiece.  The brush plating rig can also be set up as a small scale plating tank for dip electro-plating.  You can do 2/3rds of a tenor mouthpiece in a baby food jar.  I would need a taller vessel and more of the plating bath to do an entire mouthpiece.
 
I recently did a SIlverite Dukoff with a silver then gold layer.  I had troubles along the way trying to do a nickel then gold layer.  The gold peeled off.  But I do not know if it was because my voltage was too high, or the Nickel formulation was old, or there was some prep step I did wrong.  The silver/gold worked better but I do not know how long they will last.

            <pre class='message__body'>Isn&#39;t it the case that some metals adhere better to others when plating?

I seem to recall that silver is a good under-layer for gold plating, but
can&#39;t remember where I&#39;ve seen that. Silver is a very good electrical
conductor, which might have something to do with it working well compared to
nickel.

In any case, because nickel dermatitis is actually a fairly common skin
reaction (for example, from cheap jewelry) , I&#39;d think twice about using
nickel plate on a mouthpiece, even as an underlayer, because the gold is
eventually going to wear off exposing the nickel.

Dukoffs made in the last few years are all Nickel plated on the exterior, but not the table and rails.  Runyon Quantums and Smoothbores look like Nickel to me, but they may be some type of chrome.

Nickle allergies and brass allergies exist.  But they are not common.

It is common to layer silver under gold, but it is not required as many people assume.  It is mostly done to make the gold seem brighter.  Gold on brass has a more dark honey look to it.  I think Barone MPs may be plated this way.  Modern Links have a very thin layer of copper ("flash" copper), then silver, then gold.  This is what Anderson Plating does.

Prevention of nickel allergy: the case for regulation?

Lu LK, Warshaw EM, Dunnick CA.

Southern California Permanente Medical Group, 9961 Sierra Avenue, Fontana,
CA 92336, USA.

Nickel is the most common allergen detected in patch-tested patients. Nickel
allergy is highest among females and patients under the age of 18, affecting
35.8% of patients patch-tested in this demographic. Nickel allergic contact
dermatitis is a T-cell-mediated immune reaction which most commonly presents
as a skin rash in areas exposed to nickel; however, more serious reactions
to nickel in medical devices and more widespread eruptions to dietary nickel
can occur. In contrast to Europe, where regulations have resulted in a
decreasing prevalence of nickel allergy, the incidence of nickel allergic
contact dermatitis in North America is increasing. This article summarizes
primary prevention strategies as well as management of patients already
sensitized to nickel.

I do not have any medical stats, but I would say less than 1 out of 100 musicians have a problem with these.  Maybe even 1 out of 1000.  I have met 2 flute players in my life time that had a problem with Nickel-plated flutes.  One kept playing it but her fingers disolved the plating on the keys.  The other had a reaction at the lip plate and had to learn on a silver flute.  Since virtually all flute players start on Nickel flutes, this would show up the scope of the problem to musicians more than a sax mouthpiece.  Beginners start on plastic sax mouthpieces and may stop playing before ever being exposed to a Nickel-plated or bare brass mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Spot or brush plating works well if most of the original is left.  Gold 
does not adhere well to brass, so you have to do silver plate first, 
then gold plate over it.  Doc Frazier @ J&J Woodwinds does a very nice 
job and he does the plating for a couple of mouthpiece makers.

What is the condition of the original plating? If it is bubbled and peeling it will have to be removed. I have all of the needed chemicals here tonremove the plating. Robert is correct, I prefer to do the prep myself. 

Have a blessed day!

            <pre class='message__body'>Jeff,
Thanks for clarifying answer! I&#39;m still new to refacing, has only worked on about 50 mouthpieces, most HR. But lately I&#39;ve been working on some metal mouthpieces, and feel the need to learn more about replating.

I have a Sugal that I have leveled the table on, then plating disappeared. But I&#39;m thinking to fix it with silver brush plating. I also has a project with another Sugal who have lost some plating and where I think I need to re-shape the tip, rails and table. If it turns out as good as I hope, I will I contact you direct. 
Best regards,
EgilF.

OK, but before one send a mouthpiece to Doc Frazier, does one have to remove all the old plating?
