Funny that you should ask about that since I recently was looking at 
the web sight and came to this conclusion:  I am 99% convinced that 
they are identical to the now defunct L.A. Sax mouthpieces, at least 
in the external dimensions.  They had to have been made by the same 
manufacturer.  Just now, I pulled up a picture from the Oleg web 
site, blew it up and compared it to my L.A. Sax mouthpiece, side by 
side. Everything about the two mouthpieces is identical, the bite 
plate being the most obvious.  Even the laser cut engraving looks the 
same. Of course, the chamber/baffle/facing may be totally different.

I&#39;ve mentioned here before that I think the L.A. Sax mouthpieces had 
a decent design with a medium high baffle and a small square chamber, 
but the 3 pieces I&#39;ve had were very poorly finished and 2 of them 
were almost unplayable. I&#39;m certainly not saying the Oleg pieces 
would have the same problems, having never played one.

            <pre class='message__body'>Jon, I have seen a pre-production oleg tenor on the horn which does not look at all like the picture on the web site.  I probably should have asked to see the mpc. but I felt a bit shy in intruding. In any event, Oleg has a good reputation for understanding the woodwind acoustics and making quality products. Just terribly curious if there is anything to learn from the design.  It appears there are no size or facing choices. Once size fits all.  This reminds me of dave guardala. Notwithstanding all the "buzz" created by dave guardala, I do believe he contributed meaningfully to the design of saxophone mpcs., for better or for worse.

            <pre class='message__body'>I did some consulting for LA Sax a long time ago, and have quite a few of
their metal mouthpieces. Oleg&#39;s piece looks like the  exact same blank to
me. These blanks were made in Taiwan, I think by one of Charlie Tee&#39;s
companies.The LA Sax pieces were TERRIBLE insofar as finish work. The basic
baffle and chamber design was sorta kinda like a Dukoff, but the
manufacturer just didn&#39;t understand the term "smooth and even" with regard
to the facing/machining/plating. The blanks I have are all solid brass and
silver plated. I know Oleg very well, and have no doubt that he is quite
capable of taking that blank and doing something nice with it.

Funny that you should ask about that since I recently was looking at 
the web sight and came to this conclusion:  I am 99% convinced that 
they are identical to the now defunct L.A. Sax mouthpieces, at least 
in the external dimensions.  They had to have been made by the same 
manufacturer.  Just now, I pulled up a picture from the Oleg web 
site, blew it up and compared it to my L.A. Sax mouthpiece, side by 
side. Everything about the two mouthpieces is identical, the bite 
plate being the most obvious.  Even the laser cut engraving looks the 
same. Of course, the chamber/baffle/facing may be totally different.

I&#39;ve mentioned here before that I think the L.A. Sax mouthpieces had 
a decent design with a medium high baffle and a small square chamber, 
but the 3 pieces I&#39;ve had were very poorly finished and 2 of them 
were almost unplayable. I&#39;m certainly not saying the Oleg pieces 
would have the same problems, having never played one.

Yes, it is obvious that Oleg did use the same manufacturer as LA Sax 
at one time, but that they don&#39;t use the same blanks anymore.

I bought a handful of LA Sax pieces relatively cheap ($25 each from a 
music store that was closing) to use as metal blanks. They have a 
lower baffle and a smaller chamber than Dukoffs. Only one of the four 
LA Sax mouthpieces I&#39;ve bought was playable. The rest suffered from 
the problems you decribe. The ones I have are all made of bronze and 
have turned out to be good blanks.

I&#39;m still looking for more cheap metal blanks - the only LA Sax 
pieces I can find are selling for >$70 at WWBW. There is a local shop 
here in Houston selling cheap Asian-made metal pieces on Ebay for $30 
to $50 but the seller doesn&#39;t know much about the mouthpieces or even 
saxophones in general. When I get some free time (yeah, right), I&#39;ll 
drive over there to see what these are like.

I&#39;d rather have a few new mouthpieces with similar design to use as 
blanks than fish for the odd piece on Ebay.
