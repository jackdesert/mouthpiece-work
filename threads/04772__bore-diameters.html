            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Gang-

Just an observation with regards to bore diameters in vintage vs. 
modern mouthpieces . . . It seems that a standard bore diameter for a 
moder alto mouthpiece is somewhere around 0.625 inches.  I have two 
vintage pieces from the 30s-40s that have such small bore diameters 
they can&#39;t even share the same cork with a modern mouthpiece.  They 
range in the 0.61 - 0.62 inch range.  I thought there must be something 
about older mpcs that required smaller bores, but I also have a soloist 
for alto that measures 0.64 from the 50&#39;s.  It also can&#39;t share a cork 
with a modern mouthpiece (without a paper shim to hold it on).

Does anyone have any thoughts on this matter?

Thanks in advance!

  Yes, I do.  There are no, and never have been, any standards for bore diameter. 
   
  Acoustically, it makes little difference where the cork stops and the mouthpiece begins, as far as what is on the cork.
   
  But the portion of the bore past the end of the neckpipe is also part of the chamber volume.  That does affect the playing and intonation of the mouthpiece.  Any mouthpiece, to have true octaves, must have the correct ration of bore to length... and by length I mean from the end of the neckpipe to the tip.  But I am getting off the subject now.
   
  All you can do is sand the cork, or install a larger one, to fit the mouthpiece the player has chosen.

            <pre class='message__body'>The .625" bore you metioned for AS sounds about right based on what I have
measured.  A cork can handle +/- .005" well.  +/- .010" is difficult, if
not impossible.

If you only play a couple of mouthpieces, then sanding out the bore of the
smaller one is the way to go and get a neck cork to fit them.  But if this
makes both your mouthpieces larger than most others, you will not be able
to jam on other mouthpieces to try.

Some on SOTW have suggested getting two sax necks with different corks.  I
think that is silly, but it is a solution.

I have done several shank bore enlargements and reductions.  For
reductions, simply coat the inside of the bore with epoxy to reduce it.  I
use a clear quick set epoxy.  Then sand it out to shape using a sanding
drum on a high speed rotary tool.  Check with calipers as you go.
