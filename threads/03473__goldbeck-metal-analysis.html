            <pre class='message__body'>Goldbeck Sax Mouthpiece Alloy	

Cu	61%
Zn	19%
Ni	13%
Pb	2%
misc	5%

Measured 6/28/05  via	
X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrophotography (XRF)

Numbers are +/- a few %.

The impurities must include Iron.  Several I&#39;ve seen have specks in 
them that rust.

Anyone recognize this as a standard alloy?

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, to me its one of many formulations of "nickel silver" , old name  
"German Silver",  no Ag [silver] but the Ni color dominates, I guess.   Some of my 
old Chem-Physics handbooks list many Ni -S &#39;s with antique names,  will look.  
These alloys are used for clarinet et al keys, low tarnishing,  
machinable-bendable, capable of silver, nickel or chrome plating for  enhanced appearance.  
A widely used alloy.   Don

You need to saw off a 1/2" long piece of the shank and send it to me.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Anchor Bronze & Metals website (www.anchorbronze.com) website shows
the chemical composition of Nickel Siver Alloy CDA 974 as:

Cu     59.5%
Zn     16.2%
Ni     16.3%
Pb     5%
Sn     3%

Close, but too much lead and not enough zinc.

This is an alloy commonly known as "Nickel Silver" (yes, contrary to 
popular belief, there is no Ag(silver) in nickel silver...it is about 
the color). Without more accuracy, it is difficult to call the 
specific alloy, but it is from the C74x00,C75x00, or C77x00 family. 
These are generally specified in the range:
Cu 55-65%
Ni 10-18%
Zn 17-27%
The Pb is added to improve the machinability...Fe, Mn, and Co are 
also added to improve generally ductility in some cases. These alloys 
are used for precision hardware and fasteners, dental and surgical 
instruments...C75200 is used for slide tubing in high-end brass 
instruments. Steinway uses these alloys in pianos for bridge pins. I 
think that the Keilwerth nickel-silver saxophones are made from an 
alloy in this class of materials.
