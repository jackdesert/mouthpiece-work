            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Woodwind Mouthpiece Selection Book Review</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>There is a fairly new book out called "Woodwind Mouthpiece Selection" 
by Robert Scarff.  There is so little published on the subject I 
decided to grab one and review it for y&#39;all.

First of all it is a small spiral bound book that is of good printing 
quality.  It is about 5.5" wide x 8.5" tall with 95 pages.  Bob&#39;s 
writing style is humorous and entertaining and I tend to agree with 
almost everything he says.  His advice is very good and this book is 
nice contribution.   Most or all of what is in it can be gleaned from 
spending a lot of time on the Sax web forums, like many of us have.  
I could have really used this book even just 3 years ago.

The 95 pages is not all meat.  There is a lot of fluff that is sax 
related.  There is Larry Teal&#39;s reed adjustment procedure and chart 
(reprinted by permission).  There is a jokes section, miscellaneous 
sax tips, tip opening charts (same ones we&#39;ve seen, with the same 
errors), and pages for taking notes.    I counted 20 pages that 
actually have to do with mouthpieces, and some of them were half 
pages with some a reflective quotation taking up the other half of 
the page.   These are really good pages, but I want all of you to 
know how much material is actually in this book.

He talks about all the factors you would want him to talk about.  
This includes getting a sound concept, understanding long and short 
facings, open and closed tips, round chambers and high baffles.  He 
talks about what refacing can do for you, but does not get into it.  

The price is $22.95 + 3.95 s/h.  He only accepts a MO sent to his San 
Diego address.  It seems a little pricey for what you get, but I&#39;m 
sure it is what he needs to do to cover his costs and make a buck 
too.  We are a niche market.  I have included a link to his book web 
site in the Mouthpiece Works Links area under "Literature, Info" at 
the end of the list.  Here it is too:

Keith:
I&#39;m a professional writer/photographer. Keep that in mind when time comes for you to produce your own book, or if this forum collaborates on such a task. I&#39;d be happy to produce the photos at cost and edit for free. 
The things which have been contributed in this forum and other SOTW forums is staggering.
