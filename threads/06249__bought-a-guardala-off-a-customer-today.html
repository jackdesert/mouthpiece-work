            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Folks,
                 This brings up a question that may not belong here - but, I
figure the fine folks here would be "in the know" about this:
 
Question: Whatever happened to the supposed mess between Guardala, Barone
and the like? If you are to believe the rumors on usenet (use-less net is
more like it), and sax-wannabes on the web - there was a lot of animosity
and dirty business going on between the two. But, what are the cold, hard
facts? What&#39;s the real truth behind their apparent disappearance from the
market? I don&#39;t see much in the way of new Guardalas, Barones or Sugals
lately....
 
If you don&#39;t want to post here, and possibly stir up a hornet&#39;s nest - you
can email me privately. I&#39;m just simply curious.
 
Thanks!
 
Sincerely,

                Thanks for the suggestion - I had done so a couple of years
ago, exactly what you had said. But, with all the conflicting comments
posted in usenet and the WWW about the matter - it was difficult to
determine what was fact and what was fiction....
 
I knew the question wasn&#39;t entirely appropriate, and if anyone feels
offended in any way - I apologize. However, I figured that if anyone knew
the truth behind the stories - it would be someone here on this fantastic

Thanks again....
