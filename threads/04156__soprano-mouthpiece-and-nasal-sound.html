            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everybody.

Somebody can help me to understand why mostly of the soprano
mouthpieces  give a ... kind of nasal sound? Obviously that sound come
from the soprano himself but the mouthpiece can make it strong or lowest.
What do you think is the best mp to cut off what I defined as nasal?
My sop is SML Gold Medal, but I&#39;ve listen it with many mps and some of
those ad example a Yana 7 HR dont give that sound, the old metal
Selmer C* so and so, a Lackey HR7 plenty nasal. 

There is on your experience of mouthpiece workers a kind of line to
follow on the construction of soprano mp to exclude that problem? or
just some reeds compared to some kind of baffle can help?

            <pre class='message__body'>I haven&#39;t played very many soprano mouthpieces, but I find that larger
chambers with lower baffles tend to sound less nasal than smaller
ones.  Perhaps the "edge" created by a small-chamber, high-baffle
piece on alto, tenor, and bari comes out partially as a certain
nasal-ness on soprano.

refaced to 62 thou tip, Yamaha Custom (relatively cheap) refaced to 64

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith. I&#39;ve tested a Vandoren S35 but I found it a bit difficult to control, maybe a 25 will be more balanced. The ducky sound was not out anyway, better tuned with the Yanagisawa. From your words It seems to me you indicated the baffle as most responsable of ducky sound, as I was thinking...
 How much a metal mp can give a more ducky sound  than hard rubber?
 I heard from many source entusiastic people talking about the Bari for soprano. Seems reduce totally this duck-duck sound, someone have direct experience? I heard from Guardala stuff Bradford Marsalis use one HR64 on soprano. Somebody knows if it is true?

            <pre class='message__body'>Ciao GL,
I play a curved soprano partly for that reason (Yanagisawa). I currently use a standard Yanagisawa n°5 mp, and like the sound. The rubber Links are fine, and not nasal at all. I don&#39;t know exactly the "scientific" reasons, but probably these 2 brands have designs according to the comments made by Keith and the others.

In my opinion, no difference.  Its just that high baffles are found more
often in metal mouthpieces.

Yes, a HR Bari is a similar squeeze chamber design to the Vandoren.

I have a HR Bari 70 and a Ponzol HR 65.  They both are "squeeze chambers" (I
had never heard this expression until now). They look almost exactly the
same to me, except the Bari has a little bit more of a rollover baffle than
the Ponzol.

They are similar to a scrollwork HR Selmer D I have, except the Selmer
squeezes down to a smaller throat, and the throat constriction ends about
1/8 inch closer to the tip.

FWIW, the Ponzol plays more easily and projects better than the Bari, at
least for me, even though it is a slightly narrower facing. I&#39;ve been trying
to adjust the Bari to play as well as the Ponzol... so far unsuccessfully.

I find that a relaxed embouchure with the lower lip acting as a damper (like
subtoning) cuts down the nasality (I have a straight soprano.)

I think I borrowed the term from Theo&#39;s site.  I call it a squeeze throat
too.  I think it is sometimes called a double chamber, but this is less
common.

The HR Barone also appears to be from te same blank as the Bar and Ponzol. 
Meyers and Morgans have this design too but with slightly different
diameters throats.  Choosing between these MPs helped me to fine tune
intonation between ocataves.

It looks like Theo just calls this an extra small chamber.  I think 
most of the chamber is still fairly large.  The the throat is small.
