I think the mm grads are more standard, even in the US.

With the scale starting on the edge, you have the option of lining up the
scale with the tip by using some kind of "stop" like a table edge.  With
the set back style you must line it up by eye.

With the set back, there is more length near the tip to rest a feeler gauge
on.  Reading a low number, like a 2, on an edge zero gauge would be a
little more floppy, but you have one hand on the feeler anyway.

Its not that big of a deal.  If we only had one choice we would get along
fine.  I have 2 set back gauges.  I&#39;ll probably get an edge one for the
hands-on experiance.

I&#39;m not sure what you are asking here.  I think Morgan uses the Erick 
Brand system which is mm*2.

            <pre class='message__body'>I prefer to use the mm gauge with 0 setback, that is, the 0 mark on the edge of the gauge.  This way 
it is very easy to place the glass gauge on the table of the mouthpiece, and holding the table 
perpendicular to the edge of the workbench, push the gauge and tip against the vertical edge of the 
workbench to align them... and thus achieve a repeatable placement of the gauge, with fast and easy 
alignment while working.  I spend a lot of time measuring and measuring again while I work.

 

MM&#39;s (or half mm&#39;s) is the standard of comparison in the Eric Brand system and others, and is used
 by most refacers.  It is simple to convert from the half mm to mm, a divide by two... that is, a facing 
length of "50" in the E. Brand system is 25 mm.  32nd requires a calculator.  50 divided by 2 is mm&#39;s, 
then divide that by 25.4 to convert to inches.  Then multiply that by 32...well, you get my drift.

OK  I could use something bigger than the 280mm the
Morgan goes up to.  Also, thanks for the input on the
Link tenor, I will check the facing curve again.
