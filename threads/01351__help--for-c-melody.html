            <pre class='message__body'>I only have an old Buescher MP laying around.  I&#39;ll measure it if you do
not get any other responses.  But I have some other ideas for you:

You can probably get reasonably close by interpolating between alto and
tenor mouthpieces.  There are 5 half steps between Bb and Eb.  C is 2 half
steps above Bb.  So a C mel MP would take a weighted average of (3*Tenor+2*
alto)/5.  Tenor is weighted more because it is only 2 half steps away.  I
think this is called a geometric average, like averaging electrical
resistors.  But those brain cells are barely active.  Too much beer over
the years.

You can still buy C mel mouthpieces.  Runyon, Beechler, and Bill Street
have them.  You can get vintage ones off eBay too.

Last, you can probably getaway with a small chamber tenor mouthpiece.  Or
by an inexpensive MP (like a Rico Royal) and shorten it and put some putty
in the chamber.

            <pre class='message__body'>If an alto mouthpiece pitch is A, and the tenor G just below, I would 
suppose the C melody mouthpiece should produce a G# more or less.

The shank must be short enough to tune up on a Conn with Microtuner neck 
without bottoming out on tuner before correct pitch is reached.

I would make the facing length about 21 mm, and look for tip openings 
between those of alto and tenor, say, .082" - .090".

For our C melody we used a Runyon Model 88 tenor sax mouthpiece, with 
the shank shortened 1/4", and chose a #5 facing (.082").

            <pre class='message__body'>Not really necessary, there are plenty of tenor mouthpieces with smaller 
chambers.  That is why we used the Model 88 tenor mouthpiece.
