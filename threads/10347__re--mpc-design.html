            <pre class='message__body'>I have a tenor Crown New York B5 made by the Woodwind Company which I like very much. I want another as a spare.

However, I don&#39;t know if it is original or been modified. The chamber is very open with the sides under the rails really sculpted away.

Does anybody know anything about this mpc?
