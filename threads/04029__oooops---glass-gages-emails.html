            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry guys.  I thought I was sending replies to a bunch of you who 
indicated you were interested in glass gages but have not purchased any 
yet.  I then realized they were going out to everyone.

I deleted my recent gage posts from the site so they will not go out in 
the daily digest.  But for those who are set up to recieve individual 
posts, you will get about a dozen.  This will be the last one.
