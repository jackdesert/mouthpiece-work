I&#39;ve placed a copy of the program I wrote to generate the chart above

If your baffle is a high roll-over near the tip rail, consider lowering it
some.  Make sure your facing is even left/right, especially at the tip.

What type of gages are you using?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve got a standard set of spark plug gap feelers, running from .010
to .026. To get the bigger values i stacked them, to get the smaller
ones I put the moutpiece&#39;s table centered on a thinner feeler (i.e.
.010) and held it firmly against the glass while sliding the larger
feeler (i.e. .012) underneath the facing. The values were pretty
repeatable, so I think the measurements are usably close (plus
thepiece plays much better!).

My rails are very close, but my tip might be a little uneven. I&#39;m not
sure how to work it safely, any advice?

Paul Coats has some  good hand outs on voicing or Donald Sinta&#39;s voicing book is great well I hope you have some luck with a good batch of reeds.. Jason

You should be able to easily find automotive feeler guages down 
to .0015" for low $.  Precise measurements with the smaller sizes 
will help guide your work for better low note response.  For larger 
sizes I recommend the set Jeff Rosner sells.  

I too use to use stacked feelers.  I purchased a couple of sets so I 
could make up larger sizes.  I first tried taping the ends with 
electrical tape.  This worked for a while but eventually they warped 
with air pockets between the feelers.  I thin tried gluing up sizes 
with crazy glue.  Then you need to measure the exact thickness with a 
micrometer in several places to see what size they are and if they 
are tapered.  This worked better but they would still fall apart 
occassionally just when you needed them.  I am so happy those days 
are behind me.

What are you using for the length measurements?  A glass gage?

This takes practice.  Get 2 strips of 600-1000 grit sandpaper side-by-
side.  Turn one upside down for the rail/tip side you do not want to 
take material off of.  Mark where you want to take material off of 
with a pencil.  Try a light stroke to see if you are hitting the 
spot.  Adjust and try again.

If the problem is a low spot, instead of a high spot, you may need to 
open the tip to fix it or reface the entire piece to get to your 
targets.

            <pre class='message__body'>I will look for the smaller gauges this weekend.

I&#39;m using a small bit of glass from a picture frame for my glass
gauge, with a mm grid taped beneath. Not optimal either, I&#39;ll be
ordering a real one soon.

In general I&#39;ve heard that longer facings (to a point) offer better
low-note response. Is this true, or myth? What I&#39;m really looking for
is for the moutpiece to require less of the need for lower jaw 
forward extension  in the bottom ~fifth (g/f# down to Bb) of the
instrument&#39;s range.

Thanks for the tip on the tip. I&#39;ll give it a shot.

help with low notes, chirps? 
First, "Hello" from a new member (joined last week). Second, you guys

have made a huge difference in my enjoyment of the sax as I already

refaced a mouthpiece, and I&#39;m totally juiced about having a decent

piece for maybe the first time ever.


I refaced a new (virtually non-playing from the distrubutor) link 6 to

have a 25 mm facing, with a tip of 2 mm opening. The ideal radial

curve measurements are here, measured from the tip to the end of the

curve, and my actual values are within a reasonable margin of error:


mm frm tip mm gap inch/1000

0 2.000 0.000 0.078

1 1.842 0.039 0.072

2 1.691 0.078 0.066

3 1.547 0.117 0.060

4 1.409 0.156 0.055

5 1.277 0.195 0.050

6 1.152 0.234 0.045

7 1.034 0.273 0.040

8 0.922 0.312 0.036

9 0.816 0.351 0.032

10 0.717 0.390 0.028

11 0.624 0.429 0.024

12 0.538 0.468 0.021

13 0.459 0.507 0.018

14 0.385 0.546 0.015

15 0.318 0.585 0.012

16 0.258 0.624 0.010

18 0.156 0.702 0.006

20 0.080 0.780 0.003

25 0.000 0.975 0.000


Can anyone suggest adjustments to get the low notes speaking easier,

or to reduce minor chirping I&#39;m getting w/ Vandoren Classic reeds?


I&#39;ve placed a copy of the program I wrote to generate the chart above

in the files section. If you can run perl (or know enough VB to port

it to excel) maybe it will be useful, it&#39;s the mpieceSolver.pl file in

"methods".


Thanks,

Doug
