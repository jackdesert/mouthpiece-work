            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d suggest you use a magic marker to mark the facing where you want it to
begin.  Personally, I think if it&#39;s not perfect, leave it alone because the
reeds change this anyway. In other words, everytime you change your reed
it&#39;s like changing your facing.  You&#39;re probably altering the baffle to reed
ratio more than anything else anyway.  Phil
