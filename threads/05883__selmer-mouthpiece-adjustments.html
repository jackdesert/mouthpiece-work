            <pre class='message__body'>I have a question about some of the common adjustments you all make to
Selmer "Classical" Alto Mouthpieces.  For example, S80, S90, C*, C**,
etc.  I teach jazz and classical saxophone in a University setting,
and I think it is obvious that Selmer mouthpieces are recommended to
most young classical players.  However, as we all know, they are very
inconsistent.  While I believe that there are many "superior" legit
mouthpieces out there, Selmer seems to be the popular choice.  In my
studio, I have adjusted around a dozen C*&#39;s and they all play
extremely better.  However, my adjustments are based on the facing
measurements from my Alto C** that was refaced many years ago by Frank
Wells.  So, I was curious as to some of the schedules others use on
these mouthpieces, and are there other adjustments that can be done to
encourage these pieces to play better? Especially in the low end.  My
process involves flattening the table, evening the rails, putting the
right tip opening an facing on them and sometimes taking roll out of
the baffle.  basically reworking everything.  Any more suggestions or
measurements?

Thanks everyone.

            <pre class='message__body'>To say that Selmer mouthpiece facings are inconsistent is an 
understatement. However, a well designed mouthpiece can forgive an 
imperfect curve.  After measuring hundreds of C* alto mouthpieces 
over the years and averaging the results, the following appears to be 
the intent for a Selmer C* lay schedule using the Winslow kit:

.0015 - 48
.0005 - 40 
.010  - 34 
.016  - 30 
.024  - 24
.035  - 18
.050  - 10 
.063  - 4    

The tip opening is usually .068"

homepage said to have a tip opening on 0,67inch, and the length of the lay
was 22 mm.

Based on that, I am using the following numbers on the C* for alto:

 

I have a circular arc where R = 7,8

            

             0,0015   --  44  

             0,005    --  38

             0,010    --  32

             0,016    --  26

             0,024    --  21

             0,035    -- 14

             0,050    --   7

             0,067    -- End of tip

 

I am not shore if this is the very best  facing for these mouthpieces, but
it works very well for the students and others that I have been refaceing
these mouthpieces for.  I can tell you that they are very popular in Norway
too, and they are at least as inconsistent.
