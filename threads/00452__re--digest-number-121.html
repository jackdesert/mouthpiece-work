            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Thanks for these very interesting measurements, but I'd take them with a grain
of salt. While I don't know much about the tenor players, Johnny Hodges never
played a metal Link or any other metal mpc. His pictures all show rubber mpcs.
I've been told he played a Brilhart and also (from a couple of sources) that
he used a double lip embouchure, like a bassoon player, without putting his
teeth on the top of the piece. Even if that's not true, based on his ability
to do bends and glisses, I'd guess that he used a wide opening and a fairly
soft reed.

And thank you for including Coleman Hawkins. Some of us do still care.

            <pre class='message__body'>I talked to Santy Runyon about facings a while back.  He said that
during his Runyon Studio days in Chicago (1940&#39;s-50&#39;s), just about every
pro saxophonist came through there sooner or later.  He did a survey of
lead alto players&#39; mouthpieces, and almost without exception they played
tip openings about .074".

But this was at that time, and players of big band music.
