            <pre class='message__body'>Im having a hard time getting a straight answer on SOTW.  Do Bronze 
pieces need to be plated?  Also, if they are not plated do they tend to 
have an unpleasant taste.  Ive found some brass to leave a metalic 
tast.  I think Lawton and Berg used Bronze unplated...am I correct?

plate it.

Hi Sigmund,

I have a bronze Berg.  It is not plated.  A benefit of bronze is that
is does not need to be plated, since it does not tarnish as much as
brass.  It just goes a slightly duller colour.  Another benefit is
that is is tasteless, at least to me.  It is also slightly harder than
brass.

Basically brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.  Bronze is an alloy of
copper and tin.  They both may contain small percentages of other
metals as well.

I think it is a good material for mouthpieces, but I understand that
brass is cheaper and easier to cast, hence more common.

Regards,
Andrew

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, brass is easier to machine, but a little more difficult to
cast. Bronze is very easy to cast...I know a few people that do it in
their backyards, but it does not machine as easily as brass for a
variety of reasons. The plating on mouthpieces is generally to protect
the mouthpiece, not you. If you don&#39;t like the taste, then you need to
plate, or just use rubber (I don&#39;t like the taste of HR). I personally
don&#39;t detect anything with brass. The one caveat with brass, is that
if you eat a lot while playing or have basic (i.e. not acidic) saliva
and never clean your mouthpiece, the brass can decompose and will form
a green layer of copper carbonate. The &#39;green grunge&#39; that forms on
mouthpieces (and other brass) with poor care and hygiene is, in fact,
toxic. That said, the LD50 (point at which half the rabbits die) is
about 200 mg/kg of body weight . This says that an average 70 kg
person would have to eat 14 grams (half ounce) of the stuff in one
sitting. Long term it&#39;s bad for your liver. If there is no green,
there is nothing else toxic...the little bits that you wipe away are
probably 1-2 mg at a time. If you wipe off and swab your mouthpiece
each time you put it away, you will have no problem.
