            <pre class='message__body'>If I may, I think many of us, mouthpiece makers included take the mouthpiece design theory too literally. The design is, and should be entirely based on the results that you wish to achieve.  Getting into hyper-technical dimensions in an effort to create the perfect mouthpiece frequently leads to frustration and is fruitless.  There is no right and wrong, only what works and what works for one person may be entirely wrong for another.  Billy Drews uses a metal Otto Link 9* tenor mouthpiece on his alto.  It works for him and this gives you an idea of how much leeway one has in design.  Billy plays in tune. 

Adolph Sax thought the chamber should be round and so do I but most classical sax players use square chamber Selmer mouthpieces. Many great players like Lennie Picket and Mike Brecker use square chambers too although I believe that the way to achieve the most individual sound is to play a round chamber even if it means sacrificing volume.  

Presently, I make eleven tenor models all with vastly different size baffles, chambers, and bores, and intonation is entirely up to the user on all of them.  There is no "correct".

Now, if you want to talk about changing tone, that&#39;s another story but let&#39;s get of this subject because in the end it really doesn&#39;t go anywhere.  Phil Barone

Ralph is a purest and his stuff is good.  But there are a lot of 
great mouthpieces out there that do not conform to his ideals.

You can measure mouthpiece volume by putting some tape on the facing 
curve, filling the mouthpiece up with water, and pouring it into a 
graduated cylinder.  I do not have my readings with me, but each 
mouthpiece size has general volume.  Clarinet is 13.5 cc.  Sax 
mouthpieces vary by more than a tiny fraction of a cc.  Shank length 
variation alone would do this.  A sax mouthpiece with more volume may 
simply need to be pushed on the neck a little more to obtain the 
target volume.

I do not know how to figure out the optimum.  I dont think there is 
one that applies to all players and sax tapers.  But we can determine 
what works emperically.  Just measure great mouthpieces.  Just my 
opinion... let others chime in.

E.Ferron outlines a method to calculate the missing cone volume based 
on the sax neck taper.  He then measures the volume of a mouthpiece 
and calculates where it should be placed on the cork to obtain the 
volume of the missing cone.  I have tried this on several saxes and 
mouthpieces and could not obtain the best tuning with the calculated 
positioning.  Some were really close and others were off by 10 mm.  I 
suspect the neck taper on some saxes is not the best way to figure 
out the missing cone volume.  The "cone" is really a rotated 
parabolic shape.  But I gave up trying to make this work.
