            <pre class='message__body'>Really enjoy everyone&#39;s postings and info..

I had been using a stock metal Link 7* for about 20 years, and recently
bought a Vandoren metal V16 T75..... while I loved the sound of the Link
it was long overdue to look for alternatives. A long time ago
I had tried one of the early Guardalas but it didn&#39;t quite work for  
me at that time.

After getting used to the new piece, as well as the new ligature with  
it&#39;s 3 styles,
  I find it&#39;s quite the revelation playing wise..... ease of playing,  
quality of tone
  and overall amazing response throughout the horn.

I would appreciate knowing what is it that&#39;s different
between these mouthpieces that makes such a substantial
difference......

thanks..

Hi there (didn&#39;t catch your name) -

I played on a t75 for about 6 years on Tenor.  As I am mostly an alto
player, I found it useful for club dates and rock gigs (where I had to
quickly go from pop sound to jazz sound).  I don&#39;t use it any more
becuase my tastes on tenor have changed (and I don&#39;t do rock gigs and
club dates anymore) but it was a very reliable mouthpiece.  I also found
it performed best with the Optimum v16 ligature and (not that I&#39;m being
brand loyal) V16 #3 reeds.

It is my understanding that the t75 is sort of a link-like mouthpiece
with a smaller chamber (not quite round) and a longer facing length. 
The baffle is of the same style of a link (low rollover) but I&#39;m sure it
has subtle differences in dimension - I&#39;ll let one of the more qualified
mouthpiece workers answer that with more certainty.  I also think that
Vandoren has taken their finishing a little more seriously as of late
than Babbitt or other mass-production mouthpiece companies which makes
these play better on average.

Enjoy your t75.  And, if you&#39;re interested in a back-up, I have a good
one for sale on my website - www.singlereedconsultants.com
