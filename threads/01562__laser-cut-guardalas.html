NO!!!!!!!!

They are completely machine finished. But they are the best machine 
made 
models out there, by far. The last ones were made without our 
supervision. Those are the ones at W&B , not in other places. Look 
for a 
new series in the next six months or so, under my personal supervision
(And Dave&#39;s too) as I am back with Dave after a year apart.

Certain differences in opinion have to be overcome to preserve a 
unique 
partnership.  Fortunately the circumstances not under our control are 
not valid anymore

I&#39;ve measured up 2 Laser Cuts.  One was superb, one was not.  I would 
suspect the unsupervised WW&BW ones might have minor problems like 
most factory made pieces.  But I do not know that for sure.

That was put on by the sponser of this deal. I tried to have new 
boxes made but the sponser refused. One of the reasons I killed the 
relationship. It cost me alot of money to kill it. The last 1000( as 
per the disillusion agreement) were made without Dave&#39;s or my 
supervision.
