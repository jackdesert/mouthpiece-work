Thank you to you and also the administrator...

I would love to share but have nothing to share to further the
cause, at this time, other than encouragement!

            <pre class='message__body'>"Hello,

My name is Rich F., 
and I&#39;m a lurker". 

("hi Rich", "hello Rich", "howdy Rich"........)

I&#39;m new to the forum and will not be a lurker if I can help it.
 
I&#39;ve been repairing and restoring brass and woodwinds (trained at the 
old Allied factory) for the last 26 years, and I am growing (ever so 
slowly) more selective in the work that I take on in order to pursue 
the jobs I enjoy the most. I&#39;ve managed to find enough playing time 
to keep up my sax chops over the years and enjoy it as a serious 
professional-hobby. 

For the last 3-4 years I&#39;ve been poking around to see if I could find 
someone that could teach me the basics of M/P work, and came up with 
nil. 
Since joining this group 3 days ago I&#39;ve managed to get through 
messages #1 through #250 (and increase my knowledge of mouthpieces in 
general probably tenfold), and will get to the rest over the next few 
days. I feel the need to do this in order to avoid people having to 
back-track to respond to any posts I would make.
I have to take a break for the night but want to offer my thanks and 
applause, both to the owner of the forum for all the work it took 
(and takes) to create, maintain, and contribute, and to all 
participants, for the free sharing of information at this level, with 
such a friendly, helpful attitude. A very impressive bunch that I 
hope to participate with for some time to come.
  Kudos all,

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for sharing Rich.

Filling the void of your needs is exactly what this forum is about.  I have
learned a great deal on other forums and have met a lot of nice people. 
Creating this forum was my way of giving some back (even though I&#39;m still
taking).

As you have found out, the older posts talk about the basics of getting
started.  I think it would be helpfull to discuss them again from time to
time to clarify the details.  There is not so much traffic here that we can
not discuss previous topics.  I know on some forums this gets annoying.  I
do not think we will ever have that problem since it is such an obscure
topic.

Welcome.
