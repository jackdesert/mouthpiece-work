I worked on a metal Link style mouthpiece and was quite happy with the
result except the overtones are very jumpy and you can play them all like on
a trumpet. Do you have experience with this type of problem?
Thanks,

      Hi!
I worked on a metal Link style mouthpiece and was quite happy with the result except the overtones are very jumpy and you can play them all like on a trumpet. Do you have experience with this type of problem?
Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>I did not perceive it as a problem but another player trying it did. I did
