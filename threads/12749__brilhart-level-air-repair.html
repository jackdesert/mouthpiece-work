            <pre class='message__body'>First time posting here...looking for advice.

I've got a Brilhart metal level air mouthpiece that I used when I played Sax 40 years ago. Now I'm picking up the Sax again after 40 years, but I find that the Brilhart mouthpiece top "toothpiece" - the black plastic top that your front teeth bite onto...has a deep groove from all the constant use back then.

Is there any way to repair this, or is there a Vendor that will replace or repair that black plastic part of the mouthpiece ?

I think Brilhart is out of business, and I am not successful doing internet search for replacement parts for these metal mouthpieces.

Any advice is appreciated !

            <pre class='message__body'>I like to notch out the worn area so the edges are squared up.  Then I fill with black acrylic which seems to be what the original tooth deck is made of.  Typically a $25+ s/h.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Brilhart Levelaire's bite plate used to be sold separately in the '60's and 
'70's.  I have not seen a new one for years from any source.

The bite plate of the '60's Levelaire was a part molded from the same plastic 
as used to make Brilhart's plastic mouthpieces.  It was glued on, but I don't 
know what adhesive they used back then. 

You have several choices in repair.  First, you can fill the grooves with epoxy 
and file/sand smooth.  I use black plumber's epoxy putty.  After it is smoothly 
finished I apply a clear patch over it.

If there is a need to replace the whole bite plate, such as one lost or so badly 
damaged to be unusable, then I make a new piece from the beak of a cheap 
student alto sax mouthpiece.  It is glued on with a gel type CA adhesive.
