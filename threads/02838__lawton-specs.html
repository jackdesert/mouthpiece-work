I&#39;m moving this week, and when I went through a drawer of papers, I 
found an old Lawton Brochure.

It actually has tip openings and facing lengths for all SATB models.

It also states that all of the star markings are available only in 
the B or BB chambers.

Here&#39;s the spec&#39;d tip opening/facing length in inches:

4* .045/.656
5  .050/.656
5* .055/.688
6  .060/.700
6* .065/.700
7  .070/.719
7* .075/.719
8  .080/.750
8* .085/.750

Alto
4* .055/.812
5  .060/.812
5* .065/.812
6  .070/.843
6* .075/.843
7  .080/.843
7* .085/.843
8  .090/.843
8* .095/.875
9  .100/.875
9* .105/.875

8  .110/.938
8* .115/.938
9  .120/1.000
9* .125/1.000
10 .130/1.000
10*.135/1.000

This site probably got them off the brochure too:

http://www.saxophones.co.uk/lawton_saxophone_mouthpieces.htm

I have this in the Links section.  But it is good to have the numbers 
in the archives in case the site goes away.

I have checked several Lawtons against these specs.  The tip openings 
are usually pretty close.  The facing lengths vary a lot from spec.
