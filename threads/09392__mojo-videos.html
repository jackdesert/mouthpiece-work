            <pre class='message__body'>I posted a couple of ~15 minute videos on my Facebook fan page yesterday.  I think you can view them without joining Facebook:

One is of me grinding out the chamber of a Guardala LT MB2 using a high speed rotary tool.  I am converting it into a MB1 shape for a client.

The second video discusses the hand files I used on it and then demos the sanding phase of the job.  It shows how useful the plastic "sanding sticks" are.  I plan to offer these for sale soon.
