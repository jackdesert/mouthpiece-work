Hi,
   I wanted everyone to know that I am back from traveling and have finally gotten my 
website back up.....a difficult thing to do while traveling.  I have heard that some people 
where in the process of getting refunds, etc. from me while the website went down.  I 
apologize for the problems this must have brought, and I know it must have been 
concerning.  Please know that anyone can contact me at tw@... now 
and I will make sure everyone with a concern is given my full attention and that all matters 
or properly handled in a timely matter.   
     I wish all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and I apologize to anyone who has 
felt mistreated by my website going down and my email going out.

elsewhere - in court if needed.  I, too, have been out some funds from
people that one hopes to trust and I can appreciate your frustration but
other than the initial notes that I had no problems with on this list, I
think that this rehash of your private correspondence is a bit over the
line.

I&#39;m quite prepared to hear someone rant about an issue because I may be
looking to do business with that person/business and, given what Internet
dealings can be, I actually appreciate knowing about the kind of situation
that you have posted on this list.  

However this is a venue for mouthpiece work, not legal issues.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: Message from Theo of Mouthpiece Heaven



It&#39;s really nice that Theo Wanne can afford to go out traveling so 
much.  He has been away all this time.  Also is planning on 
traveling From January to April... 

    One might think of paying off any outstanding debts, and taking 
care of paying customers before going on vacation.  These are the 
very polite response emails that I&#39;ve been getting from Theo Wanne...
  Mind you it&#39;s been almost a year - no mouthpieces - no refund.

            <pre class='message__body'>It may not be anyone&#39;s business why Mr. Wanne had to travel.  Some 
things are "personal reasons", and that should be good enough 
explanation.  But you are correct, John, if someone, such as Mr. Wanne, 
has been a straight shooter in the past, there is no reason to think bad 
motives when there are problems.

I wish Mr. Wanne well, and am glad to see him posting and back taking 
care of things.
