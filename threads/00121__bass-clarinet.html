            <pre class='message__body'>Anyone have any success getting "more" out of a bass clarinet?  I&#39;ve 
made one .090" tip MP out of a Brilhart.  It works, but it really is 
not any louder than my stock Vandoren B45 (.073"), with a Powertone 
baffle.  The chamber of the Brihart is a little different, but it 
does not seem like it would matter this much.  I tried some 
variations with putty baffles, but nothing sounded promising.

I&#39;m about to work on a old Vito BC MP to see if I can make a winner 
out of it.  I&#39;m just trying to make something a big band bari sax 
player would like for doubling.  Maybe I&#39;ll try larger still...
