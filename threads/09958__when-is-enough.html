            <pre class='message__body'>Never EVER issue an exchange or refund until you have seen the returned 
item.  It is well within your legal rights to refuse to accept damaged 
goods.  When I was in college I worked for a large bookstore chain.  A 
guy once brought me an oil soaked book he had kept in his trunk for 
months and honestly expected me to give him credit for it.  I informed 
him that not only were we not a used book store, but that returns on new 
books had to be re-sellable.  Send the piece back to him and tell him he 
has just been the inspiration for your new returns policy.

            <pre class='message__body'>We encounter the new consumer strategy of canceling the credit card payment and failing to return the merchandise. This happened three times last year. We require payment via bank wire for all transactions over $500. Good luck to them when they try that with a bank wire. Again, some people don&#39;t like this. That&#39;s totally OK with us. We do.

            <pre class='message__body'>Although I agree that this customer should be SOL on the damaged mouthpiece, it was not the Woodwind/Brasswind return policy that sank them.  It was a legal battle with the former employees of Music 1-2-3 which WWBW took over.  They lost to the tune of $30M dollars.  The business was prosperous before that.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think that honesty its long gone, if the seller is willing to trust someone... Then way the costumer have to be an asshole and yet to be right???
(Sorry the the bad word)
But in order to do a living all points needs to be clears and if the costumer broke the aggrement need to be forced to keep the rules.
And please the costumer and the seller are humans, the humans do mistakes, they not allways are right.
