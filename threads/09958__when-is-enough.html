why accept returns, especially on custom orders?  We maintain a showroom where customers are welcome to try our products to their heart&#39;s content...we don&#39;t send things out "on trial" or "on approval".....this sort of thing forced Woodwind/Brasswind into bankruptcy a few years back.....yes, some customers complain, but the amount of business we miss as a result of this policy is more than offset by the lack of problems......works for us.......

A customer returned the mouthpiece- custom order Link with med chamber to 
exchange it for something else. Nothing new except he drooped it (tip and shank) 
and rolled on a concrete making it hard to sell even after fixing it.  How do 
you guys deal with such issues?

We maintain a showroom where customers are welcome to try our products to their heart&#39;s content...we don&#39;t send things out "on trial" or "on approval".....this sort of thing forced Woodwind/Brasswind into bankruptcy a few years back.....yes, some customers complain, but the amount of business we miss as a result of this policy is more than offset by the lack of problems......works for us.......

(Sorry the the bad word)
But in order to do a living all points needs to be clears and if the costumer broke the aggrement need to be forced to keep the rules.
And please the costumer and the seller are humans, the humans do mistakes, they not allways are right.
