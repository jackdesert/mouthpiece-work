            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all!  

Steve has a kit he uses, from Babbit?  He can tell you more about 
that.

I can also highly recommend the kit I use, from Madison Enterprises.  
Madison Enterprises is John Winslow, as in the Winslow Ligature.  He 
ran the facing machine for Santy Runyon many years ago in Chicago.  
This kit can be found at Woodwind & Brasswind.

There is also a kit from Ralph Morgan, and while I have not seen it, I 
am sure it has all you need and is of good quality.  Ralph would do it 
no other way.

While you are getting tools, lay in a supply of 600, 800, 1000, and 
1500 grit silicon carbide paper.  

Also, I like smaller, narrower files than the ones supplied in my kit. 
 You can get many good handtools, useful for gunsmithing, instrument 
repair, model work, as well as mouthpieces, from www.micromark.com.  
Their main clientelle is model builders, particularly model 
railroaders... but the tools required are the same.  The catalog is 
free for the asking.

            <pre class='message__body'>I got a large granite block (level to 15/10,000ths) from Enco Supply; glass gauges from J. J. Babbitt; and feelers from Pepboys. Paul showed me how he added larger grips to the feelers, and I went a step further and covered the ends with Plasti-dip. I got a tip opening gizmo from Babbitt, but it&#39;s not very precise, so I use a digital caliper that I got from Enco. For baffles, I use (upon Jon Van Wie&#39;s suggestion) J. B. Weld.

            <pre class='message__body'>The larger feeler grips were simply screws and wing nuts.  They came
with the Madison Enterprises (Winslow) kit.

When I visited with Steve last year, and met Ron Coelho there, he used a
glass gauge (with lines for measuring along the facing with feelers)
that on the opposite end had a hole drilled in it.  To measure tip
opening, he would turn the glass around, and hold it on the facing with
his thumb, the hole over the tip of the mouthpiece.  He would then
insert the end of his dial caliper, the "depth gauge" and get a reading,
subtracting the thickness of the glass.

Of course, with any method, you must be right on the tip of the tip
rail, about to fall off the end.  You can get various readings as you
move the probe around the tip rail.  This is difficult to do, and you
must practice to get consistent, meaningful readings.

I would like to measure the same mouthpiece with various types of
gauges, and see what differences are inherent in each.
