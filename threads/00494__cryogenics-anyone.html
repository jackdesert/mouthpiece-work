There is no scientific basis or evidence whatsoever that cryo treatments change--or can change--the playing characteristics of a saxophone. Once the metal is thick enough and rigid enough to withstand vibrating sympathetically with the air column, changes in the material cannot change the sound.
 All the explanations so far put forth--such as relieving stress or rearranging molecules--have no scientific basis, apart from the fact that these things do no happen when treating brass with cryo.

The most plausible explanation for the "cryo effect" is psychological, in line with expectations. The easiest way to test for this would be double-blind testing of a cryoed horn plus control. No one seems to have done this. Other possibilities are changes in other factors, such as pad seating,
 after the rebuild required by cryo.

I welcome divergent opinions and the reasoning behind them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Here are some of the claims about cryogenic treated saxophones that I
have found on the web in my research.

The first is taken from this link:    Cryogenic Treatment
&lt;http://www.saxgourmet.com/cryogenic.htm>

In an ideal world, the saxophone would be responsive at the softest
pianissimo levels and would not break up at at fortissimo; intonation
problems could be easily adjusted; and the timbre of each note would be
even. Of course, we know that this is not the case, but through
cryogenic treatment, many of these deficiencies can be considerable
improved.

   The problem starts with the manufacturing process. As tone holes are
drawn from the body, as the bell is shaped over a mandrel, and as posts
are soldered, the natural lattice of atoms in brass is disrupted,
causing internal friction. The natural structure of brass is such that
the atoms line up in perfect rows that are densely stacked atop one
another. During the manufacturing process, this alignment is disturbed
as the atoms are dislocated. The metals ability to resonate is
diminished so that only the strongest harmonics of each pitch are
transmitted.

   Cryogenic treatment removes residual and compressive stresses in the
saxophone by allowing the brass to return to its optimum structure. The
instrument is gradually cooled (over a period of 24 hours) to
approximately -400 degrees F, and then allowed to return to normal
temperature gradually (another 24 hours). The saxophone is NOT immersed
in liquid nitrogen (this is a dry process) and no damage will occour to
lacquered or plated finishes. There is occasionally some loosening of
pads and corks.

   Cryogenically treated saxophones are more responsive dynamically, have
a more even scale, and have less "dead" notes.

From the Yamaha article at this link:  Yamaha
&lt;http://yamahawinds.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/cryogenic-treatment-special&#92;
-yas-82z-saxophone/>
The cryogenic treatment helps to  reduce this inherent stress caused by
the manufacturing and assembly  process.  This in turn allows the
cryogenically treated instrument to  respond more easily with greater
resonance along with a more even  sound/color characteristic.  In
general terms, the cryogenic process  doesn&#39;t change the basic
qualities of the instrument but rather enhances  the various positive
aspects no differently than playing the same  instrument for decades of
live performances would.

You would think that at least Yamaha would have the resources to do a
more "scientific" study than have Greg Vail play the sax before and
after a week apart.   Perhaps they could have Joe Wolf at UNSW run
measurements on the same saxophone before and after the cryo treatment
to measure the sound spectrum and acoustic impedance and do a
comparative analysis.
I have discussed this at length with Wayne Tanabe, and I am convinced he
really believes in what he is doing.  He claims that the cryo won&#39;t make
a poor instrument play like a quality instrument, but that it will make
a good instrument play better---whatever that means.  In my next post I
will include some of the findings of the Tufts University study.

If we accept the premise that the metal does not vibrate enough to influence the sound perceptibly, we are forced to conclude that the reasons given in both these citations are without any foundation in acoustic fact.

As you know, there has been a great body of experimentation and research in the past 100 years on this question, and none of it has indicated that the material of which a woodwind body is made has any perceptible influence on the sound.

Given that, all the reasons given below in your citations turn to vapor.

Marketing vapor.

I would tend to agree with that statement.  However there exists  substantial anecdotal evidence from professional brass players who had their instruments treated by Wayne Tanabe at Brass Bow before he went to work for Yamaha that the cryogenic treatment improved their instrument&#39;s playing characteristics.

I think it is important to note that they would not freeze an instrument without first doing a thorough ultrasonic cleaning first. That may have been a contributing factor in some cases.

I am also a bit curious as to whether "relaxing" the molecular stresses in a thin walled brass tube could possibly alter the interior shape and dimensions enough to produce a noticeable change in the way the instrument plays and responds.

As you know from our previous discussions I tend to agree with the science, but at the same time I am reluctant to believe that skilled highly intelligent professional players are deluding themselves when they perceive a change in an instrument they have played for years and are intimately acquainted with its playing characteristics.  

That said, I recognize a substantial difference between cryogenically treating a trumpet and a tenor saxophone as they are world&#39;s apart structurally and acoustically.

            <pre class='message__body'>I understand your reluctance to accept that competent and sensitive players are fooling themselves. That is what keeps this debate alive. Here is an interesting excerpt from a discussion on a scientific newsgroup. Read especially point 3.

*********

 Ok,
 Here&#39;s what we "really" do know.
 1) The walls of a flute do not participate measurably or noticeably in the sound production. Benade aside, still living acousticians such as Coltman have done much to validate or dispel statements about gold or silver or platinum or various alloys of these metals. Coltman did some fascinating
 double blind tests of different metals against each other, and against some oddball materials (including cardboard and concrete). No contribution to the sound making process.  
 2) People who have done work on other woodwinds (including sax, which has the highest ratio of enclosed airspace to metal mass of any woodwind) and brasswinds like trumpet and English horn (Fletcher, Nedervee, Coltman, Rossing, sorry about the spellings) have gotten similar results. Including
 some published papers utilizing nearfield acoustical holography and vibration sensors mounted on the walls of the horn.  
 3) The measurable change in physical properties (hardness and modulus of elasticity) produced in cryogenic treatment is much smaller than the tolerance variations introduced by variations in wall thickness produced by tubing manufacturers from batch to batch, variations in hardness and elasticity
 produced by tolerance drift in the metal drawing and forming processes, contamination of the alloys, and variations in machining and soldering processes.  
 4) Everything that the Miyazawa web site [http://www.miyazawa.com/tech3.htm] that you pointed us to, as far as metallurgical effects that can actually be measured, indicates that cryo treatment has exactly the same effect on the metal as heat hardening (increased strength, hardness, and stiffness
 of silver, no noticible effect on gold). Although 50 hours of cryo treatment looks like it would cost about 100 to 1000 times as much as a four hour heat hardening.  
 5) Cryo treatment (and heat hardening for that matter) can&#39;t be done with the pads in place. Any time a competent instrument technician dismantles and reassembles a flute, you either replace or at least readjust and reshim the pads, as well as adjusting (regulating) the mechanism. The end result
 is exactly the benefit that is quoted for the Cryo treatment "Virtually all the instruments treated have an increased capacity to play softer and louder, by as much as 30%. (This is based on substantial anecdotal evidence, not a decibel meter.)" Plus other stuff about increased pitch stability,
 cleaner attacks, and evenness of tone, all widely acknowledged benefits of repadding and readjustment.  
 What&#39;s more, we have measured, on a good sound meter, the effects of a competent repadding on a flute, and it&#39;s way more than 30% louder or softer. This even includes most brand new, freshly padded flutes.  
 So, unless they can show us some measurable results, with a really masterfully padded and regulated flute as a starting point, I&#39;d put the claims of the Cryo folks over in the shallow end of the credibility pool.

            <pre class='message__body'>These points are well taken.  I will have to accept your word for #3 since I have not read the technical piece that makes this claim.  However, I disagree completely with #5:

"Any time a competent instrument technician dismantles and reassembles a flute, you either replace or at least readjust and reshim the pads, as well as adjusting (regulating) the mechanism".

That is simply not true of any woodwind, even flutes.  I disassemble flutes that are in perfect regulation and adjustment all the time to remove the tarnish from the body and check them again upon reassembly.
If keys are fit well to begin with and no keys are bent in handling then reinstalling the key putting the pivot screws back exactly as they were does not change the seating/sealing of the pads.

The trickiest woodwind of course is the oboe if it has cork pads with deep seats.  Those keys must be put exactly in the same location or they leak upon reassembly, but again if the keys are well fit to begin with it does not present a problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, I agree that probably--if the flute is re-set up using the same pads--there should not be anywhere near a 30% difference as claimed. This changes somewhat if the whole thing is overhauled, of course.

As with so many points in the materials debate, the effect of expectation or belief on perception can really only be controlled in a decent double-blind test. But there is no known physical basis by which things like cryo alone could make a perceptible difference. Personally, I have quite a bit of
 faith in the state of knowledge in this regard, as I witness the reliability of more extreme applications of this knowledge, such as in aeronautics and space flight.

 "Any time a competent instrument technician dismantles and reassembles a flute, you either replace or at least readjust and reshim the pads, as well as adjusting (regulating) the mechanism".
 
 That is simply not true of any woodwind, even flutes.  I disassemble flutes that are in perfect regulation and adjustment all the time to remove the tarnish from the body and check them again upon reassembly.
 If keys are fit well to begin with and no keys are bent in handling then reinstalling the key putting the pivot screws back exactly as they were does not change the seating/sealing of the pads.
 
 The trickiest woodwind of course is the oboe if it has cork pads with deep seats.  Those keys must be put exactly in the same location or they leak upon reassembly, but again if the keys are well fit to begin with it does not present a problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>An additional thought.  If the keys were also cryogenically treated,  then the pads would need to be removed and replaced.  That would introduce the need to either reseat or replace each pad.  That said, I would seen no reason to cryo the keys in the first place.

I believe I read somewhere that Goodson would only sell his cryo treatment as part of a complete overhaul.  The customer would certainly claim that the sax played better afterward---especially if there were leaking pads to begin with which is usually the case when a sax needs a complete overhaul.

I&#39;m still intrigued by the anecdotal evidence from brass players on this topic just as I am about the effects of adding weighted bottom valve caps, adding or moving braces, or adding mass to the third valve slide.  

Has anyone ever done a study of the effect on a note of adding mass to the outside of a thin walled tube at the exact place of that note&#39;s node or antinode?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,

As always with anecdotal evidence, it is very difficult to know how to use it, apart from as an indication of a good direction for more formal research. Seems to me that the effects of the mods you mention would be easy to test in double-blind situations, in order to eliminate observer bias, which
 has been shown to be a major factor in things like this. Once that is eliminated, then you immediately get to a point where such mods either make a physical difference or they don&#39;t. 

If they don&#39;t, end of story. If they do, then of course it is time to start searching for physical causes. With this kind of thing, it might also be very possible to eliminate the player in the first place: blow the horn artificially and measure acoustic data, as well as using laser
 interferography to see what is vibrating and how much.

Unfortunately, until such testing is done, we are left in the dark.

Seems to me that Gilbert&#39;s study addresses your question tangentially. He found that when a tube finally does vibrate in a breathing mode (and it is not so easy to get it there, as you know), 

In Sec. IIIC for this unusual instrument ,it has been
shown that some slight tone color variations can occur when
an acoustic resonance or antiresonance coincides with the
resonance frequency of an ovaling mode of the resonator .An
approximate value of the &#64257;rs tovaling frequency has been
computed for real instruments using realistic geometrical and
material parameters...As the eigenfrequency of
the &#64257;rst ovaling mode for the &#64258;uteis 1900Hz, effects similar
to the ones described in the present paper, such as slight tone
color modi&#64257;cation, might occur but may however be even
weaker due to wea kellipticity and because of additional me-
chanical damping due to stoppers or &#64257;ngertips. Acoustic
impedance measurements of a real &#64258;ute resonator has been
carried out, but no clear evidence of additional peaks ap-
peared. Brass instrument bells, which have large diameters
and low mechanical frequencies,and which are free to vi-
brate, might show small acoustic impedance disturbance. For
metal clarinet or trombone slide, coincidence may occur on a
high harmonic, and effects are unlikely to be expected.For
the wooden clarinet ,such effects, even if present, are likely
to be inaudible as the ovaling frequency lies in the ultrasonic
range. On the contrary, because of their softer construction
material--lead tin alloy--and a larger inner radius, greater
effects can occur for organ pipes, as the ovaling frequency is
only a few hundred hertz, as shown in Table I. This mechani-
cal frequency may match the fundamental playing frequency
on particula rpipes in a stop.In that case, wall vibrations may
even induce transition to pseudoperiodic regimes of oscilla-
tion and wolf notes,,as has  been already observed
experimentally.

The perturbation can be signi&#64257;cant near the eigenfrequencies of 
the ovaling modes of the duct. The importance of asymmetry
already noticed and studied has also been shown experi-
mentally and theoretically; it has been demonstrated that for
a perfectly symmetrical tube such a coupling cannot occur.

In practice, for real instruments, perfect symmetry s not
achievable due to the presence of side holes or keys, for
example, but would not be suf&#64257;cient to achieve measurable
coupling with mechanical ovaling modes of the structure.

John, read that last paragraph again, although the grammar is wrong, it says something important.

 reason to cryo the keys in the first place.
 
 I believe I read somewhere that Goodson would only sell his cryo treatment as part of a complete overhaul.  The customer would certainly claim that the sax played better afterward---especially if there were leaking pads to begin with which is usually the case when a sax needs a complete overhaul.
 
 I&#39;m still intrigued by the anecdotal evidence from brass players on this topic just as I am about the effects of adding weighted bottom valve caps, adding or moving braces, or adding mass to the third valve slide.  
 
 Has anyone ever done a study of the effect on a note of adding mass to the outside of a thin walled tube at the exact place of that note&#39;s node or antinode?

            <pre class='message__body'>"Differences in behaviour between cylinders and cones are demonstrated.
Contrary to cylindrical instruments, for conical instruments there is a
subcritical threshold and no small amplitude oscillations. Moreover,
there is more than one regime at the fundamental frequency in conical
instruments. Two of these, similar to the Helmholtz motions in bowed
string instruments are studied in this paper. Theoretical results are
qualitatively compared with experiments using a blowing machine."

It is publication #13.  The part that interests me is the two regimes of
oscillation of the fundamental in conical instruments.

            <pre class='message__body'>The gist is that a a cylindrical instrument is like a string bowed in the middle, whereas a conical instrument is like a string bowed somewhere else. Gilbert says that the main difference between cylindrical and conical is that the conical instrument has at least two resonance frequencies, the

Just consider the difference in timbre between a string bowed in the center and near the bridge and you&#39;ll get the idea.

It is publication #13.  The part that interests me is the two regimes of oscillation of the fundamental in conical instruments.

            <pre class='message__body'>A resonance encompasses a range of frequencies, having minimal amplitudes at the extremes and one peak amplitude in the middle.  A regime is the formation of a self-perpetuating relationship between one select frequency of a (fingered fundamental) resonance and the respective integral frequencies of other natural tube resonances, that integral value falling within their frequency range.  A regime in a conical instrument consists of resonant frequencies of at least 2 natural resonances, forming the fundamental and the octave harmonic.
