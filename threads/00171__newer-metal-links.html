            <pre class='message__body'>I have not looked at a lot of Links.  I just got a used newer STM 
6*.  Along the center inside the baffle/chamber there is a ridge.  
Instead of a nice gentle arch, there are like two arches.

Are these MPs still cast in two halves and then joined somehow?  If 
so, what I am seeing is just some sloppy work on smoothing out the 
seam.
