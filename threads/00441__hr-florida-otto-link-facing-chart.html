            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone got a facing chart for a HR "Florida" Otto Link (4* to 5* 
is what I&#39;m looking for)? Since I don&#39;t know which feelers are 
supposed to be used for each of the lengths given, it&#39;s probably a 
good idea to sa which ones are at which lengths, just to make sure I 
don&#39;t misunderstand things.

Alternatively, if anyone has a facing for Getz&#39;s mpc&#39;s from 
the "Bossa" period (of course, the real facing would be more useful 
than a contrived one, but who knows if Joe&#39;s old boss actually had 
the real facing or not???), that would be a great help. This is for 
the Rico Royal mpc that I said about earlier (obviously I&#39;m going to 
grind out the baffle and chamber to be more like a Link&#39;s chamber).

Thanks in advance.

Danny

From "Joe" on SOTW (again we can not verify this info):

Stan Getz 
Metal Link STM 
87 tip 
27-20-13-10-6 1/2 (in mm.) Note: Most glass gauges are marked in 1/2 
mm. 
Rico #3 reeds 

Feelers .0015, .010, .024, .034, .050 

Getz did play on a lot of different pieces, but this was his favorite 
facing on metal Links as he had several Links done to this facing.

use Ben Harrod, so it makes me wonder if Joe&#39;s old boss actually did 
do the Getz pieces, of whether it&#39;s just another one of those "I 
think Getz would use this facing" things...

Also there are a few "Pompano" Otto Links. Is Pompano another 
mouthpiece refacer, or is this some sort of special model?
