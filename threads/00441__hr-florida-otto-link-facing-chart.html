            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone got a facing chart for a HR "Florida" Otto Link (4* to 5* 
is what I&#39;m looking for)? Since I don&#39;t know which feelers are 
supposed to be used for each of the lengths given, it&#39;s probably a 
good idea to sa which ones are at which lengths, just to make sure I 
don&#39;t misunderstand things.

Alternatively, if anyone has a facing for Getz&#39;s mpc&#39;s from 
the "Bossa" period (of course, the real facing would be more useful 
than a contrived one, but who knows if Joe&#39;s old boss actually had 
the real facing or not???), that would be a great help. This is for 
the Rico Royal mpc that I said about earlier (obviously I&#39;m going to 
grind out the baffle and chamber to be more like a Link&#39;s chamber).

Thanks in advance.

Danny

From "Joe" on SOTW (again we can not verify this info):

Stan Getz 
Metal Link STM 
87 tip 
27-20-13-10-6 1/2 (in mm.) Note: Most glass gauges are marked in 1/2 
mm. 
Rico #3 reeds 

Feelers .0015, .010, .024, .034, .050 

Getz did play on a lot of different pieces, but this was his favorite 
facing on metal Links as he had several Links done to this facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>From something else that was put onto the SOTW list, Getz seemed to 
use Ben Harrod, so it makes me wonder if Joe&#39;s old boss actually did 
do the Getz pieces, of whether it&#39;s just another one of those "I 
think Getz would use this facing" things...

Also there are a few "Pompano" Otto Links. Is Pompano another 
mouthpiece refacer, or is this some sort of special model?

            <pre class='message__body'>"Florida" Links were made in Pompano Beach, Florida.  Hence the reference to 
"Pompano".
