            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

I&#39;m giving a clarinet mouthpiece masterclass at Kennesaw State 
University, just outside Atlanta, Georgia on the 24th of April.  If 
anyone is interested, here is the link to the event: 
http://www.kennesaw.edu/music/CLARINET_PAGES/clarinet_symposium.shtml
 
In regards to the commercial postings, it is my opinion that the 
manner in which we receive these messages is easy enough to skip 
over a posting in which one is not interested.  I&#39;d rather know what 
is available (especially in the way of tools) to help me in this 
business--I know we all like to do this, but we are trying to make a 
living too.  If someone has a good product for sale, I&#39;d love to 
hear about it!

Musically,

Ben Redwine
