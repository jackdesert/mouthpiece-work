I&#39;m just beginning with the mouthpiece work,something that has 
interested me for years though.I have found the basic tools but I 
find it very hard to find a completely flat glass surface I could 
work on.If I understand,correctly this is a must thing to have.Where 
to get one? I have some glass surfaces but these are not completely 
flat.

            <pre class='message__body'>I went down to the local glass store and had them cut me one.  It 
only needs to be flat enough for table flattening work.  Maybe USA 
glass is flatter.  

I think a Formica topped table would be flat enough too, but you 
would end up scratching the surface a lot with "sand" and metal 
dust.  Precision granite would work great, though it costs more and 
shipping is high if you can not find one locally.

Glass is nice in that it is somewhat portable.  I use to store my 
stuff in a briefcase.  Lately, I have been experimenting with 
adheasive backed sand paper.  I have 2 plates of 3/8" thick glass 
that I flip over to get 4 wrking surfaces.  I have 1 surface blank 
and the other 3 surfaces with 220, 400, and 600 grit mounted on 
them.  I lay finer grits on the blank surface as needed.  This could 
be done with a larger granite surface, but more space would be needed.
