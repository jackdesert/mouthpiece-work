I have some 12inch strips that I can cut to length.
They are not however stainless steel.

            <pre class='message__body'>In a discussion with John Winslow he commented to me that you obtain 
very nearly the same reading with a .002 feeler as you do with .0015", 
and the .002" is less likely to wrinkle.  He sent me a few, and I have 
to agree, a good substitute for .0015".

            <pre class='message__body'>On a typical soprano facing, .0015" gives 37 on a glass gage and .0020"
gives 36.  One number difference would be typical on larger mouthpieces too.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, you just take that into account. You can accomplish the same work 
in the end.
