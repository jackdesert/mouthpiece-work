The mouthpiece looks like it would have a clarinet tenon design.  

I have seen some pics of an alto and tenor versions that have what look like metal alto and tenor necks on them.

                  Does anyone know how the mouthpiece neck transition is made in the Tarogota?  It is a Hungarian wood instrument with a tapered bore and looks like a straigh sop sax.

All the "soprano" sized instruments all have clarinet-style mouthpieces and tenons.  The larger versions have what looks like normal saxophone-type necks and moutnpieces.  Interesting,  What significance would you attribute to this difference?  Convenience or acoustics?

The brown sop (2nd pic from left) has a sax-like mouthpiece.  The tenon is on the upper section of the Tarogota body.  So it looks like both designs are in use (MF & FM).
 
I have read that the Tarogota was invented shortly after the sax.  I would doubt that its inventor(s) knew more about acoustics than Sax did though.  But who knows?  Differences could be motivated by acoustic theory, mis-applied air flow concerns, wood cracks during manufacturing/use, trial and error....
