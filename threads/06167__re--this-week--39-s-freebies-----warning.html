As Moderator here, I have removed "carlaclayton15"&#39;s membership.

This spammer has shown up under various names on other yahoo groups
of which I am a member or moderator.

Whatever you guys do, do NOT click on the link in carlaclayon15&#39;s
post. If you do you are letting yourself in for free viruses,
trojans, and other problems.
