            <pre class='message__body'>What follows is a reiteration of what I think I&#39;ve read here so far.  
The main idea behind my doing this is to be sure I&#39;ve pulled together 
the correct info to begin working with.

Thanks in advance for any feedback, including further clarity or 
details, about this stuff.  I&#39;m not so worried about how accurate the 
supplier info is as I am concerned with and would like feedback about 
the list of tools and supplies I&#39;ve pulled together from all previous 
postings.
