It might be fine dust left over from sanding getting between the

rinse off the mp in water and let it dry before continuing.

            <pre class='message__body'>My biggest issue is putting the glass measuring gauge in the same 
exact spot both left to right (perfectly straight) and top to bottom 
after a slip or remeasuring, etc.  After all, if you are off top to 
bottom .005" in it&#39;s position, your gauge is going to be off the 
same amount.

The best method i&#39;ve found it to butt the glass & mpc up against a 
preknown flat surface to confirm the tip and gauge are matched - and 
then visually check.  Of course, you do have to make sure that you 
are perpendicular with both too otherwise it will be off.

I have to ask... to the people having inconsistent readings... 
   
  Are you using zero end gauges or set back gauges?

  I use a zero end gauge, and align by holding the mouthpiece/glass perpendicular to the vertical edge of my workbench each time.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a set back gage and I use the same eyes to zero it as I trust to read
the feeler measurements.  ;)

Once in a while I think I may have a HR mouthpiece that seems to be
changing on me.  I think there may be some thermal swelling of the table
that makes the smallest feeler drop in a little farther.  But it is also
very easy to mess up the facing length while working near it.  So I&#39;m not
convinced one way or another.

Some wood mouthpieces are really bad to work on.  About half are stable,
the rest deform with temperature and moisture.  I had one I had to reface
"wet" and warm in order for it to play well.  When it dried, it did not
measure well, but I left it alone.

            <pre class='message__body'>The temperature would have to be extreme to affect the results of a  
mouthpiece job in progress. 
I also use the set back glass gauge and place a thick feeler gauge at 
the zero line with the tip of the mouthpiece against it to assure that 
the mouthpiece is correctly placed for accuracy. My kit also includes a 
zero at the edge glass but I prefer the set back glass and have used 
both in tests for accuracy. The readings for both are the same as long 
as the mouthpiece is assuredly at zero on the set back style glass.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Moisture could be the problem. Condensation from playing or even that of your
warm hands touching the cold surface of the hard rubber (especially during
humid atmospheric conditions) can cause the glass gauge to float on a thin
film of water on the table’s surface. This issue is a little less profound
when measuring a facing with a concave table. This issue can be a real problem
when measuring a mouthpiece with a convex table.  I always like to proof my
work by measuring the mouthpiece **dry** and clean. I also agree with the
folks who recommend cleaning your tools frequently. Any dust or moisture on
your glass gauge or steel feelers will also cause issues. Brad Behn
