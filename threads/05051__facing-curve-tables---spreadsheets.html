            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------The numbers in black indicate how far each feeler gauge (thicknesses listed in
blue on the left) goes down a glass gauge, calibrated in 1/2-millimeters (as
most are). So, on the tenor spreadsheet, if you look at the values for a "6"
facing, the .016 gauge, for example, will slide down the gauge to 30.1. (This
would be 15.05 mm).  
  
These numbers are generated by the spreadsheet (not taken from measurements of
factory-fresh mouthpieces, which can vary wildly). By changing the radius (R,
on top) and 'absolute-length-at-zero' (M) numbers, you _will_ change the
facing values below. They will match some other radial curve (that's what the
spreadsheet does). But you want a curve with the facing length and tip opening
you choose, and that compensates for the width of the tip rail (usually set at
1.5 here), and these are those curves for the specified facings.  
  
If your feeler gauges are different thicknesses, you can insert those and the
spreadsheet will tell you the correct values for your feeler set.  
  
Hope this helps.

That does help, thanks.  While facing lengths are commonly expressed,
along with tip openings, upon what does one base their chosen radius
values?  Does that value represent the curvature of a perfect circle
with that radius in inches?  I&#39;m missing something in there.

length you're shooting for. One of the possibly confusing aspects is that some
of the measurements are in inches (radius, tip) and some are in mm (or half-mm
- like facing length). The beauty of the spreadsheet is that it sorts all the
geometry out, as well as accounting for the different units. My clarinet
mouthpiece, for example, is labeled 108, for 1.08 mm, even though saxophone
mouthpieces (and most clarinet mpcs, too, I think) usually use thousandths of
an inch to express tip opening (like a Berg 110 = .110", although it rarely
actually measures that way, which is part of why we have refacing work!).

            <pre class='message__body'>If you specify a tip opening and a facing length, there is only one radius
that will give you them.  This assumes that the radial curve is tangent to
the flat table at some point a little longer than the facing length.  The
curve then swings up a little to pass through the XY point that is defined
by the facing length and the .0015" feeler.  Then it swings further until
it passes through the XY point defined by the tip rail width and the tip
opening.  You either have to manually guess at the Radius or use Excel&#39;s
built in solver tool to iteratively solve for the best R that minimizes the
"error".

  By varying the radius of the curve, and where the arc is tangent to the table (facing length) tip opening can be varied.
   
  We can&#39;t measure where the arc meets the table (facing length) because that would require a feeler of zero thickness... the best we can do is use a very thin .0015" feeler (or 0.04 mm), which is close.  That is the standard for designating facing length.

This last bit of facing adjustment at the very tip seems to be (in my
limited experience) a necessary final touch, and has made a huge difference
in how responsive mouthpieces I&#39;ve been working on play. It feels very much
like a seat-of-the-pants adjustment, altho I can imagine that some kind of
jig for holding the mouthpiece at various fixed angles could be useful for
getting it done very accurately.

            <pre class='message__body'>OK, I&#39;m looking at "Facing Curve.xls" as downloaded from the site and
unmodified.  I see six figures entered into the Spec column.  I
presume those came from Eric Brand and serve as some sort of base
standard upon which this spreadsheet operates.  But what happens if
you don&#39;t have those values to work with--do you ignore the Spec
column, and therefore the Diff column and Error Sum function
altogether?  And if you don&#39;t have the Brand figures to work with how
would you have any idea what to put in the Spec column?  I mean,
that&#39;s why you NEED this spreadsheet, right?  (I have the original
Selmer Band Instrument Repair manual, and I guess the chapter on
mouthpiece refacing is from Brand, but there&#39;s not much in there in
terms of measurements.  Are those available elsewhere?)

Then the instructions say at a minimum in the Spec column to enter the
.0015 and Tip values.  If that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got in the Spec column,
mustn&#39;t you need to get rid of the other Brand Spec values and the
math functions in the Diff column for all but those two lines,
otherwise the Diff values and Error Sum function become meaningless? 
And do those really have any meaning if there&#39;s only two of them?

After adjusting M so that "L at Tip = 0" you&#39;re then supposed to
"Adjust R until the Error Sum of the Diff is minimized."  But as soon
as you do that "L at Tip" no longer = 0, right?  Is that OK?

principles involved in applying the facing curve, I&#39;m just not
following what to use for reference points.

There is some discussion in Message Post #1453.  I think you said you read
that message, but if not it does answer some of your questions.

You can use the "Spec" column to record your starting measurements of a
mouthpiece you would like to improve.  You can work off of some E.Brand
numbers directly.  But the spread sheet radial curve will give you even
better numbers for facing targets if you are looking for a smoother facing
curve.

You can get a feel for typical ranges of tip openings and facing lengths by
measuring every mouthpiece you can get your hands on.  There are also a few
sites that have this info, but mouthpieces vary a lot from listed specs.

There are some old message posts that will help, but I know it can be
cumbersome to search for them.  If you want some facing length and/or tip
opening suggestions, ask the group.  I&#39;m sure your interest in this is not
unique.  Lurkers and active members have the same question but have not
asked them.

Yes, you need to delete the other entries and formulas.  You will be left
with an error sum based on two values: the tip opening and the facing
length.  You need to determine the R and M value that creates a curve that
passes through (or real close) to the tip opening and the facing length
points.  You need a minimum of 2 XY data point to determine a radial facing
curve.  Its one of those "2 equations, 2 unknowns" things.  If you have
more points, you need to decide how to run a curve through the points.  The
spredsheet suggests minimizing the error sum as a way of fitting the curve.
 But you could als, say, run it through the low spots so you only need to
work on lowering the high spots.  But in practice, if you flatten the table
some, you will have enough material "raised" to work towards a best fit
average curve.

It is best if you go back and adjust M some more, then R again.  Back and
forth a few times until you zero in on values that give you the smallest
error sum.

Most "old timers" work off tables of numbers scratched in their personal
notebooks or from memory.  I think the spreadsheet methods take the art to
the next level.  It gives you a visual analysis of where you are at and
where you want to be.  Speadsheets can also be used show how much reading
on the left and right rails are off from each other.  I magnify this
left/right error X10 and plot it as I work.  This highlights areas I need
to "attack".

I think that would be a difficult way to work.  

The edge zero glass gauge is intended to be physically zeroed with the
mouthpiece tip on a table edge or other suitable "stop".  I suppose any
glass gauge could be zeroed by eye anywhere.  But the convention is the
very tip (outside the tip rail).

            <pre class='message__body'>Exactly right, Dan, that&#39;s what I was confusing.  I assumed that
because you measure the tip opening at the inside of the tip rail that
you&#39;d measure the length of the facing from the same point.  That
actually makes sense to me on some intuitive level.  But it sounds
like the convention for measuring the facing length is, in fact, from
the outer tip of the mouthpiece.  And that makes sense, too, as I
guess the entire width of the tip rail comes into play in how the reed
vibrates against the mouthpiece.  Right?

            <pre class='message__body'>Another reason for my confusion:  in the spreadsheets one is
instructed to enter the tip opening in the F column and then "adjust M
until L at Tip = 0".  The tip opening, of course, is measured at the
inside of the tip rail.  I assumed, therefore, all the other facing
length values followed from THAT point back to the break.  In the
absence of reading anywhere else that "you measure the facing length
from the outer edge of the mouthpiece tip," measuring from the inside
of the tip rail struck me as pretty sensible.

  I use the zero edge glass gauge.  The gauge is placed on the table, and holding the mouthpiece so that the table and gauge are horizontal, the mouthpiece and gauge are pressed lightly against the vertical edge of the workbench, quickly aligning them.

          Thanks, Keith, that is hugely helpful. Just one followup, and it has
to do with where zero on the glass gauge is set: at the outer end of
the tip or at the inner edge of the tip rail. I understand how to
account for that on the spreadsheet, but if someone passes along a
list of values, say, .0015H, .005C, .0108, etc., do you PRESUME
zero was set at the end of the tip or at the inside of the rail tip? 
Is there a convention or consensus on that? Thanks again.

  Yes, it should be the radius of a perfect circle whose arc is tangent to the table.  (See?  I paid attention in geometry and calculus!)

  By varying the radius of the curve, and where the arc is tangent to the table (facing length) tip opening can be varied.

  We can&#39;t measure where the arc meets the table (facing length) because that would require a feeler of zero thickness... the best we can do is use a very thin .0015" feeler (or 0.04 mm), which is close.  That is the standard for designating facing length.

    with that radius in inches? I&#39;m missing something in there.

      Yes, it should be the radius of a perfect circle whose arc is tangent to the table.  (See?  I paid attention in geometry and calculus!)

      By varying the radius of the curve, and where the arc is tangent to the table (facing length) tip opening can be varied.

      We can&#39;t measure where the arc meets the table (facing length) because that would require a feeler of zero thickness... the best we can do is use a very thin .0015" feeler (or 0.04 mm), which is close.  That is the standard for designating facing length.

  What if you used a .0010" feeler?  Or .0005"?  It would go in perhaps a mm further.  Hah!  If you used a .00000000" feeler, it would pass all the way to the butt end of the mouthpiece!
   
  Measurement with the .0015" feeler is considered the facing length.

    If I sometimes want to measure closer to the point of zero to 
make sure that the lay starts parallel, I use a new sheet of 
cigarette paper to measure the start with. They are even thinner than 
the thinnest feeler.I use the side with no glue on. I have not found 
any other way to come closer to the point of zero.

       If I sometimes want to get closer to the point of zero to 
controll that the start of the lay is parallel I use a new sheet of 
cigarett paper which is actually thinner than the thinnest feeler. I 
use the side without glue onit.that is the closest I have been able 
to get to the point of zero on the lay.

           an interesting thread,
I have been filling in my spreadsheet measurement points, from feeler
.0015" to Zero, with 5.3 ( E Brand scale ) This was based on the
average of a selection of posted Clarinet curves.

It might be useful as Geoff says, to have an agreed figure for this
measurement, for clarinet through to baritone.

 This might be difficult though, as lays vary in length so much and
opinions differ as to what is a medium length.

I bow to Paul&#39;s greater knowledge, but was surprised to see he
classified 15 - 16mm clarinet as Medium length.

I find this particularly interesting, as I have been experimenting
with the length of Clarinet lays and have a preference for this
length, thinking of these as Short, based on published charts.

With Vandoren clarinet lay lengths seeming excessively long and Rico
Graftonite lengths, often greater than the published figures, we will
perhaps never have an answer to the .0015" to Zero question ? Eddie.
