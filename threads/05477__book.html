            <pre class='message__body'>You can purchase it from Ferree Tools. I don&#39;t recall the price, but it is
not expensive.

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s about $25.  Somebody is selling it on Ebay now for $27.  
Google "Band Instrument Repairing Manual."  I just got a copy and now 
I&#39;m looking for the specialty tools that it shows.  It seems like the 
only one that isn&#39;t fairly standard is the "glass direct reading gauge" 
shown in the book at figure 92.  Where do I find that?

Sure, I would take one. And while you&#39;re at it, I would also take 
one of your glass gauges. You could send both at once. JT
