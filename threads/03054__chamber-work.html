What are your opinions on opening up the chamber on a HR LINK similar 
to the vintage style pieces? What else would you have to do? Would it 
be feasable to add a slight baffle at that point? How would this 
affect the playability of the stock facing curve and tip opening. 
Please advise.

I think all players should do their own experiments with making 
baffles using a temporary putty, wax or clay.  This allows you to 
explore that variable without damaging a mouthpiece.  Its best to 
start with a large chamber MP so you have room to play around before 
you choke the chamber off.  If you find a baffle you like, you can 
make it more permanent using epoxy putty.

Enlarged chamber mouthpiece sound lush, dark and sultry to those who 
like them, tubby, stuffy and unfocused to those who do not.  I think 
adding some baffle after enlarging a chamber helps to fight the 
stuffy&#39;s while preserving the "roundness" in the low notes.

            <pre class='message__body'>Opening up the chamber will give it a hollow, more muffled tone, and 
lose the "core" to the tone.  Leave the chamber as it is.
