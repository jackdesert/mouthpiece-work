            <pre class='message__body'>OK, guys, some of you have placed preorders, and yours will be shipped
by Wednesday morning.

I have some clarinets, most with good cork, and the facings all look
good, will play.  They have some cosmetic stuff... misstamped logos, or
multiple stamps.  Looks like they were used to adjust the die on the
branding machine.  But they are all playable.

Altos, all with good facings, same thing as above.  Some have logo
misstamps, some are clean.  If you order just one, I will send with logo
misstamps.  If you order more, I will toss in some clean ones.

Interestingly, there is one set of four alto mouthpieces, with little
stickers, 5,6,7,8.  As if they were adjusting the facing machine or
something.  Actually they range from .078"-.086" approximately.  The
tips need filing to contour, and perhaps minor baffle filing.

Tenors, some have the tip filed to shape, some not.  Since you are
facing to a larger size, this does not matter.  Most of the tenors are
clean, no logos.

One bari left, and it has an area where the logo has been ground off.
With a little sanding and polishing, that can be made to look OK.  Like
the tenors, the tip is not filed to reed contour.

No caps, ligatures, or boxes are included.

So... prices...  $7 each, regardless of alto, tenor, bari, or clarinet,
plus $3 for shipping (within the U.S.) to you, regardless of quantity.
No overseas shipping, sorry.

I could make every one of these into a playable mouthpiece with just a
few minutes work, without touching the facings.  And if refacing to
larger sizes, some interesting pieces.  Many of the unstamped ones could
be made into sellable pieces with minor work.

If interested, email me at tenorman@...
