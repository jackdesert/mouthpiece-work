Last I heard, it sounded like you were in or near the path of Rita: just 
hope you&#39;ve battened down the hatches and that you&#39;re OK! Sounds like 
(hopefully?) less of a problem for Steve and New Orleans this time. Hope 
everyone else reading this from the Gulf Coast is ready and in a safe place!

            <pre class='message__body'>Joe, it&#39;s rainy and windy, but about like a bad thunderstorm.  We are out on the
very edge as it passes us by.  Thanks for asking... we&#39;re fine here.  Paul
