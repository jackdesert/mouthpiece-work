Rita [off-topic] 
Paul,


Last I heard, it sounded like you were in or near the path of Rita: just 
hope you&#39;ve battened down the hatches and that you&#39;re OK! Sounds like 
(hopefully?) less of a problem for Steve and New Orleans this time. Hope 
everyone else reading this from the Gulf Coast is ready and in a safe place!
