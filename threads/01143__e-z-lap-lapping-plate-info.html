            <pre class='message__body'>A "real" lapping plate is used by a machine shop to flat finish metal
parts.  A lapping compound (like a gritty mud) is put on it.  Grooves are
cut into the plate so the excess compound and metal dust has a place to go.

The E-Z Lap is not a true lapping plate.  But I think it is better suited
for refacing needs.

Normally I don&#39;t write in to you.  I love to read about the foibles we sax players are constantly facing.

Here&#39;s one.  I sent in $60. for the E-Z Lapping Plate, heard from him once about being behind, now the being behind, is being behind the behind.  Tried to get a phone # to call, and there is no listing.....can you help?

Thanks,

Fred Gruenebaum
