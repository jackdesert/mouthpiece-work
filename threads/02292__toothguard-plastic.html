            <pre class='message__body'>Greetings, I know we have discussed the plastic for toothguards
before, but I had an "idea" that I wanted to bounce off you. (Having 2
Brilharts that needs toothguards, and being cautions about the
inertness of  epoxy..) Can we assume that most plastic mouthpieces are
made of "food safe" plastic? If so, then a current "student model" MP
ought to have the makings of about 10  or 15 toothguard inserts of a
cost of under $10, and sometimes less. Whaddayathink? JimG

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, I have done exactly this, cut the beak section from a student 
mouthpiece, and ground/filed to shape, then polished.
