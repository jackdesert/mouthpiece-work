            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve got a couple of the oft talked of yet hard to
find tile seperator baffles. Got them from a firend
who got them from a tile setter directly, I have not
been able to find them locally either. 

One caveat with them, they are narrow. they fit nicely
into a Runyon Quantum tenor piece, but they are too
narrow for my Link STM so they would probably be of
limited use anyway.

Has anyone tried using the rubber casting molds, like
I see in the Micro-Mark catalog, that would allow
reproduction of the same baffle several times.

            <pre class='message__body'>Even though they are narrow for some tenor pieces, they sound like they
would work for many pieces (alto, sop).  

I have made baffles and Spoilers fit tighter or more toward the tip of the
MP by making them wider.  "Paint" on a layer of epoxy on the sides and
lightly sand when dry for a custom fit.  I would think you could make the
tile spacers work for all tenor and bari MPs by augmenting them some.

Maybe you could epoxy two of them side by side and trim them to suit. 
It looks like time for another trip to Home Depot.

            <pre class='message__body'>The nice thing about using a plastic substance like epoxy putty as a baffle is that you can shape it and test the response for several hours. When you are satisfied with the result just let it harden.

            <pre class='message__body'>They are not at my Home Depot.  I could not find them for sure on the 
web (not enough pictures on the sites).  I have not tried our local 
tile supplies stores yet.
