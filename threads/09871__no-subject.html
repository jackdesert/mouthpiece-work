  Hello, everyone
iMy name is Fran, I am 30 and I am a clarinet professor at the Cadiz Conservatoire (South of Spain). I am new at refacing mouthpieces. I would like to Know if starting to reface from the tip downwards is a good idea. Also I would like to ask yoor opinion about Pyne Bel canto open facing. 
Me and my students usually play on open facings mouthpieces. The ones which allow more air to come in.
Do you have any suggestions?
All the best,
Fran 		 	   		  </pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Fran,
I usually start the other way around from the window but I don&#39;t see why
somebody would not start from the tip.
I have limited experience with clarinet mouthpieces and their facings since
I play only saxophone.
As a suggestion you can subscribe to the yahoo group - Mouthpiece Work.
There are a lot of people sharing their knowledge there and I&#39;m sure your
time will be well spend with it.
Regards,

Hi Fran:

It is more sensible and less time consuming to start with a level table and proceed towards the tip with your procedure. If you start at the tip and then level the table it will change the measurements that you have already accomplished. Then you will have to go back and adjust the target measurements on the curve once again.
