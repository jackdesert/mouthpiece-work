Senators:
   Accidently I&#39;ve started my learning of refacing technique by 
reading this dispute (December 2004). I would like to add some 
comments. They may look naive for you, gugus, sorry. 
   I&#39;ve studied hydrodynamics 20 years ago and still have some 
memories. Common rule is that chaotic detours start for sure if the 
channel opens more then 12 degrees. So there is a bunch of detours in 
ANY mouthpiece, swirling flows, etc. Shortly speaking- there is a 
full chaos there, no reason for a dispute.
 
I&#39;ve tried comparison of spectras  of couple Mouthpieces and found 
that there is another real mess there, hundreds of piks, not much 
predictable. I&#39;ve dropped this activity after I found that sound 
sample from internet recorded in .mp3 has the whole range of &#39;middle-
high&#39; frequencies missing completely but sound did not loose its 
quality. I&#39;ve used recommended trial version of &#39;CoolEdit 96&#39; 
software.

After all, I would vote for intuitive approach and practical advices 
of players.  

With Best Regards
Dmitri

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Dimitri,

I didn&#39;t mean to start a dispute with Adam, I just wanted to point out that since you have standing waves happening in the mpc you can&#39;t really think of it like a normal laminar flow. I figure that the better picture you have of what is happening in there in your head, the better your intuitions are going to be. 

I agree that the dynamics are so complicated that it is very difficult to model what is happening inside a mpc on a computer, so seat-of-the-pants intuition and empirical experimenting are still (and probably always will be) the order of the day. 

One other problem you will have in analyzing mp3s taken off the internet is that you have no control of the mic position, the mic itself, the sax, the reed, the player, or of the ambient reflections. Without standardizing those variables you don&#39;t stand a chance of coming up with any meaningful results re: mpc variations IMO.

Toby, I agree completely. Progress is made by intuition armed with a 
science.
