            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, I had a diffuser made for my enlarger by a local glass shop out 
of thick frosted glass.  They didn&#39;t want to chamfer the cut edges, but 
they &#39;softened&#39; them with no complaint.  Looked sort of like they had 
been belt-sanded, with no sharp edges.  Safe to handle.  Might not be 
accurate for the &#39;zero&#39; gauges, though.

Just an idea,
Len

            <pre class='message__body'>I explored a couple of lower cost glass options that had sharp edges and/or
quicky belt sanded corners.  It would be possible to make and "economy"
glass gage and save even a few more bucks.   At this point though, you
really are getting what you paid for.
