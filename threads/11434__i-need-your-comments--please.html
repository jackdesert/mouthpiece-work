I need your opinions. I am an apprentice  clarinet mouthpieces maker . I am learning since 1 year and 30 blanks spends. I think my progress has been good (better than my english), but I have a problem. When I play with my mouthpieces  f or ff, the sound is  not centered, withouth any focus. The brightness is in excess, is not round sound.  Can anyone help me to know why it happens? What area I am working wrong?
Thank you so much for your comments,

            <pre class='message__body'>In the files section of this group, read the Runyon Papers / Runyon Mouthpiece Articles.

The area just past the tip rail is known as the "baffle".  The first 1/4" (6 mm) has the most effect on the higher overtones you hear -- the "brightness" or "edge".  The closer that area is to the reed, the faster the response, but too much can cause "chirps" and "squeeks".  If you file away too much material the tone can become dull and not responsive.  Be careful here, remove only a little material each time and test play often.

I will put a drawing in the photo section in my folder of how and where to remove material.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have just posted a new drawing in the photo section, File_Baffle_Darken_Tone.jpg.  

 

 Also you must realize that it is normal for the higher overtones to increase as you play louder.  This happens with all wind instruments.  Most of the additional energy (blowing harder) increases the overtones (or harmonics), both in intensity and number of harmonics, more than the fundamental.
 

 I used to have a sound analysis program that was quite useful, but it was not updated to work with more recent versions of Windows.  I have lost touch with the fellow that created the program.  It was quite good.  But you could play softly, and see the fundamental, and the first few overtones, and very little of the higher ones.  As you played louder, the higher overtones increased in number and intensity, the fundamental did not change.
 

 And it is that "edge" to the tone that allows you to be heard well in a large theatre.  The "edge" disappears with distance.  

 

 Also, those stronger overtones are right where the ear is more sensitive, from 1000 hz (1 khz) to 3 khz.
