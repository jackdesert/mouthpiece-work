            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys 
 

 

 I just want to know if it is possible to make a rollover baffle from a flat baffle when refacing???
 

 

 I tried many times on how to do it but unfortunately it just forms a concave-ish shape on the baffle..
 

 

 Anyone can help on how to do it?

            <pre class='message__body'>You need to open the tip to get enough material to shape a rollover.  Then you need to close the tip if it is too open.   Using epoxy or layers of lacquer (clear fingernail polish) can work to build up a rollover baffle.  But I do not really like how it turns out.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys
 

 

 I just want to ask
 

 Is it possible to make a rollover baffle from a flat baffle when refacing? 
 

 

 I wanna know how to do it. Tried to file the baffle a time but it seems that nothing is happening..It just forms a sort of a concave shape on the baffle
 

 Anyone out there that can help?
 

 

 I'd would deeply appreciate it..
 

 

 Thanks
