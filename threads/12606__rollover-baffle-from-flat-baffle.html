            <pre class='message__body'>You need to open the tip to get enough material to shape a rollover.  Then you need to close the tip if it is too open.   Using epoxy or layers of lacquer (clear fingernail polish) can work to build up a rollover baffle.  But I do not really like how it turns out.

 I just want to ask
 

 Is it possible to make a rollover baffle from a flat baffle when refacing?

 Anyone out there that can help?
 

 

 I'd would deeply appreciate it..
