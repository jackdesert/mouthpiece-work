            <pre class='message__body'>I have a few older pieces that I&#39;m trying to clean up, one in 
particular is half brown from oxidation.  I&#39;ve tried Kit "Scratch 
Out" and a vinegar solution, but without much success.  Any other 
ideas?  Has anyone tried the stuff from the link below?
