            <pre class='message__body'>Is the Winslow gauge simply an indicator dial on a half bar or base I 
think I remember mentioned in an earlier post?

Also, am I correct in understanding calipers and a glass gauge from 
Babbitt can be used to make the same tip measurement as the Winslow 
gauge?

BTW, thanks Keith, for the feedback on the SaxJ articles.

            <pre class='message__body'>Look at the home page of the Mouthpiece Works site.  There is a picture of
the Winslow gage there.  Your description is correct.

(If your are reading this post at some later date, I may have moved the the
picture to the photo area on the site.)

            <pre class='message__body'>The Winslow gauge is a dial indicator mounted on a fixture, made of bar
stock aluminum.  The Babbit kit, I think, has a glass gauge and a
�tapered wand� type gauge to measure tip, not calipers.
