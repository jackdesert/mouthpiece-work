for me personally i would like the bite plate on one of my otto link 
tenor mpcs replaced not with epoxy. i would have a metal bite plate 
instead to get more vibration through the mpc. that would give a 
minimal amount of sympathetic vibration and therefor an increase in 
sound but this is only in theory. i own mpcs with no bite plate and 
you can feel the vibration, just cover it with some tooth patches and 
your all set. waddaya say Kieth?

            <pre class='message__body'>Soft tooth patches definately change how vibrations are transmitted to you
ears via skull vibrations.  I think the listener hears very little
difference unless the player is trying to over compensate based on his
perception of the tone difference.

For many players, the tooth vibrations are too irritating when not using
soft tooth patch.  I&#39;m one of them.  The side benefit is that they protect
the mouthpiece and keep you from ingesting tooth deck material.

vibration does 
equal more sound correct.

Sure.  We can put a man on the moon, I&#39;m sure a metal bite plate can be
done.  Some MPs like SRs are solid metal.

But I do not think the listener will hear more sound.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve used epoxy to repair various tooth grooves in rubber/plastic pieces but I think you should always use a clear tooth patch on the repair.  If a tooth patch had been used in the first place the repair probably wouldn&#39;t have been necessary.

I also use epoxy to build baffles but I only use an epoxy putty that is approved for contact with drinking water sources.  I still don&#39;t feel totally comfortable using the stuff but it seems more safe than anything else I have found without getting into the whole epoxy debate.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have done some not so scientific experiments with different necks and using different patches and even reeds on various mouthpieces in my home studio.  I have a very nice 24 bit card that is very similar in quality to the Pro Tools stuff.  Anyways, I have a Mark VI tenor that I was never truly happy with and as a result picked up a 103k or so neck.  I really liked that neck and thought it made a nice difference to the sound of the horn.  I then recorded the new neck and the old neck back to back after asking my wife which neck she liked and she replied that they sounded the same.  On playback, there was no difference between the necks.  I then repeated the experiment with a single mouthpiece and different levels of tooth patches - no difference.  The only difference was when I changed reeds and even then I would argue that the average listener wouldn&#39;t know the difference between the sound of a horn with a Hemke versus a Rico Royal or a Fibracell.

I eventually solved my VI issue by having the key heights raised and suddenly the horn played like a great VI instead of an average VI.  Needless to say I&#39;m putting the 103k neck on eBay soon.
