            <pre class='message__body'>Speaking of CA glues, I have found some CA, through my model railroading hobby, specifically made for engineering plastics, Delrin, Celcon, Acetal (generic name for Delrin), etc.  It works quite well.

Yesterday I saw a version from Locktite at the hardware store that also came with a sort of primer or activator for the plastic.  Here it is:

And an aside, the "Baking Soda Trick"

I&#39;ve done this for years.  This works because the CA requires a high PH and a bit of surface moisture to set.  Sometimes, if very dry, just the moisture of your warm breath (like fogging a window) will quicken curing.  You can also mix a little water and baking in a spray bottle.  This is the same as "Zip Kicker", or CA accelerator.

            <pre class='message__body'>One good app for a glue that works on Delrin would be adding a tooth deck to a Runyon Custom Quantum mouthpiece.  Runyon offers the option for their metal Quantum but not their Delrin one.
