            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, Everyone!  This is my first redo of a Dukoff, so I&#39;d like some 
input from the group.
The piece is marked: Super Power Chamber, Dukoff, Miami, Florida on the 
top and D7 on the table side. The facing length is a 47 using the 
Morgan gauge and the facing is balanced, ending in a .108 tip opening.  
The rails and tip are clean and sharp.
Here are three issues I have to deal with: 
1. Very heavy oxidation of the Silverite.  It is almost black in 
spots.  What&#39;s the best way to clean/polish this type of metal?
2. The shank is bent out of round, not much but it doesn&#39;t fit on the 
cork very well.  Recommendations?
3. There is a "blob" of metal at the bottom of the ramp that leads from 
the baffle into the chamber proper.  It appears to have been added at 
some point in time.  Since it is irregular in shape, I&#39;m assuming it 
should be removed/smoothed.  I would radius it like the chamber.  Why 
wold anyone do this?  Is it simply a manufacturing flaw?
Thanks in advance for all advice.

If a client wants it cleaned up, I&#39;ll use light grades of sandpaper.  220,
320, 400, then steel wool, then a polishing compound.

This is cool:  I use a set of socket wrenches on an extension handle.  Just
find one that barely fits in and wiggle to straighten it out.  You need to
be careful enough not to create a bulge.

I think you are referring to the Dukoff "wart".  It is more evenly formed
on the newer pieces and the plastic Dukoffs.   It is part of the design.  I
like to remove it on tenor mouthpieces but altos I do either way.  

I have a photo spread of my rework of a Dukoff on my site.  If you have not
seen it.  www.MojoMouthpieceWork.com

            <pre class='message__body'>The "Silverite" metal is very soft, like solder.  It is easy to dent, and just using the glass gauge and feelers will mar the facing.  Be aware of that and handle very carefully.  When you return it to the customer wrap the mouthpiece separately in bubblewrap. Do not put the lig and cap on it.

            <pre class='message__body'>My thanks to Paul for the helpful advice on working with "Silverite."  
The material doesn&#39;t seem so soft when trying to gently remove 
the "wart," but I take your caveat seriously and am handling the piece 
accordingly.

Thanks also to Keith for answering my questions, especially the super-
neat idea for using a socket and extension handle as a rounding die.  
I&#39;ll keep this in mind for other applications as well.

This is truly a terrific site!  I really appreciate the expertise-
sharing attitude of everyone.
