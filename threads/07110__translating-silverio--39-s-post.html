I thought Silverio&#39;s post was very descriptive, and well done considering the difficulty of translating difficult technical terms and procedures.

Yes, he was suggesting roughening the rails, applying an adhesive such as CA or epoxy, setting the mouthpiece face down on I think, poly film ("Saran Wrap" or similar?) until it hardens, then reshaping with a file, and refacing to a smaller size.

Hi folks,

This is a bit of a dicey issue, but here is the deal:

I was looking for a good chromatic tuner for the PC and
ran across an older app called G-Tune. I find it really
great, as it has many features which are useful, including
a spectrograph, an oscilloscope and needle ballistic
settings, which are very valuable for getting the average
tuning of a note. Lots of other good things too. A very
nice piece of work

It was shareware, at a very reasonable price, but it is
now discontinued and one is not able to register it. I
looked around and found a keygen for it which is clean and
works fine. I would be happy to have paid for it, but at
this point I feel that it is not too sinful to use the
keygen, as there is no other way to get it to work.

Is anyone interested in this? I could upload it to a
file-sharing site for download.

OTOH if this is illegal, immoral and/or unethical forget I
ever posted this message...

Toby

Hi, Yes his post was good.  I had not heard of this procedure before and wasn&#39;t looking to close any opening as I wasn&#39;t concerned about the opening on the mouthpiece in question.  I would be interested in knowing the state of refacing in South America.   What are the techniques and what equipment they use. Perhaps Silverio will respond if he reads this.   All the best.

No estimated John, my indications not talk about removing file marks in the baffle area. I was refered about the good traslation and interpretation of Paul, that&#39;s correct. 

This solution in the very open tip mouthpiece, save have that scratch or rasp the table to obtain down the tip in relation of straight line of complete table. Expect that you can be understood!!

I presume that this handwork in South America are in the same situation that worldwide level. For the little money personal situation of the mayority Argentine people here sell clone of relevants mouthpieces, facsimiles that i don&#39;t to do; but i know that&#39;s happen and not only in my country don&#39;t you?

I have my proper system of calibration and gauges are tested to succes and errors.

Finally, i believe yet in the intuition, attribute that to facilitate together with all theorical conceptual to advance and to progress to the humanity. But not be able omit that all that the humanity to do are absolutely apply to the same. The person, the people is the referent or referable. The technology is OK when not omit that we are a part of nature.

Each human denture, tongue, lip, buccal cavity, aero-phonology capability, adaptation capability, talent own, etc., is so important as the best mouthpiece and your tip aperture, facing rails, baffle features, chamber magnitude, bore, etc., and have to coincide.

Those coincidences are that i procure, without major complexity.

Fraternally yours

Silverio

            <pre class='message__body'>-Hi Silverio,  It is interesting how unique we are.  Even when testing mouthpieces we have to use our own skills and our own embouchure.  I recently experimented with some teeth guards that would help my sharp bottom teeth when playing the clarinet.  The material was too thick but more interesting was what it did to my sound.  It totally changed my control of tone on the clarinet. A little change of mm or two made a drastic change ...I really couldn&#39;t test any mouthpiece with this guard in my mouth.

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s Right John. I have play friends that your embouchure is as horrible the same as my english language jajaja!!!! Well, the mine embouchure also that jeje The reason, the lower denture. Commonly this part of the mouth, for aged person, as me, (63 y.o.) isn&#39;t conditions for good pressure under the lip, is deficient or injure or hurt the lip. Is impossible play well and outcome fault performance.
 
The teeth guard, if are very well hand-made is irreplaceable for us. This problem is so important for me that i have postponing to do unipersonal shows and group together for this reason. The problem is that the local dentist not know our situation despite i explain him. Solely know the nocturnal denture bruxim protection and this not it&#39;s the same for me. I believe than my solution is in the NBA&#39;s dentist jajaja!!!

know you how i can make one hipoallergenic teeth guard. Fundamentally the material to use? Reality, it is an matcher of low denture, especially of the frontally denture, well polished and rounded. I have some idea, but not encounter one material sufficiently malleable.

Respect flute i just now starting learn all of this noble instrument,
just as the trumpet and horns. The woodwinds have us very applied only on these and the costumer need always more services.
Fraternally...Silverio

I recently experimented with some teeth guards that would help my sharp bottom teeth when playing the clarinet.  The material was too thick but more interesting was what it did to my sound.  It totally changed my control of tone on the clarinet. A little change of mm or two made a drastic change ...I really couldn&#39;t test any mouthpiece with this guard in my mouth.

Very different sounds - although surely the miking also made a difference

The best sounding (to me) was on that white plastic piece - a Brilhartz
Tonalin was it? Ballsy, juicy, thick. What a kick-ass solo.

Of course, if Don was also selling his own mouthpieces, there&#39;s no telling
what was *inside* that white mouthpiece - did his own pieces have raised
baffles?

The shaved-headed Menza on what looks like a Link seems to be working more
to control the piece. I think he&#39;s going for a smoother sound though, to
match the style of musical piece. And there&#39;s a little clip towards the end
where he riffs briefly on yet another mouthpiece - hard rubber with a
standard lig is all I can tell - sound is closer to the white Bril, and he
sounds more facile

Last clip sounds like a small-chamber high baffle piece, with a cutting
quality.

            <pre class='message__body'>No way. I have seen Don Menza do this demo, live. And he makes them sound the same. It is really rather amazing.

The demo he did was on a Metal something (Dukoff or Guardala), a link, and some plastic student mouthpiece. 

Though last time I saw Menza he was saying he liked to get old Links and mod them to his own sound liking. I don&#39;t remember what he did to them exactly......

him one on one listening to him play and learning from him. I&#39;ve seen him
use a variety of mouthpieces, and he always sounds pretty much the same.
He&#39;s one of the greatest players I have ever heard, and one of the most
consistent. He&#39;s given me a good bit of advice (he is HIGHLY opinionated!)
on my designs.

            <pre class='message__body'>So, possibly the very open mouthpiece has certain tonal advantages, demonstrated by those well know players who use them - Pete Christlieb, Plas Johnson, Ernie Watts, Lennie Pickett...., but like everything else saxophone, it comes at a price - there is a trade off.  I know from my own  experience playing a Link 10* for some time on tenor, the sound was great, but it took more energy to get it going and more energy to keep it under control, and there&#39;s only so much energy to go around.  Once you get that big sound in your head though and how it feels, you can take some of it back with you to a smaller set-up, and use that energy for other things.

It is a good counter-point.  I can not think of an example of a famous player changing "their sound" without changing their mouthpiece.  Other than when they play a ballad or in another style.  Then there are lots of examples.

But that&#39;s just the point isn&#39;t it?  Isn&#39;t that the same thing as saying that the mouthpiece makes a big difference?  It certainly made a big enough difference for him to prefer one mouthpiece design over another.  If the sound comes from the player, and not the mouthpiece, as some advocate, then the player wouldn&#39;t need to change mouthpieces, when his sound concept changed.  He would just change his sound.  It never works that way though, because the mouthpiece is an integral part of the player&#39;s sound formula.

            <pre class='message__body'>-    I had rather the opposite experience than what you describe.

            <pre class='message__body'>I tried a RPC .150" for a while.  It was surprisingly playable due to Ron&#39;s good facing work.  It felt more like a .125" in other brands.  But I could only sound similar to Plas.  It was a "one trick pony" for me and I could not control it to play the sounds that I needed.  Extreme mouthpiece designs do make a difference.  Very open/closed tips, very high baffles, and very large chambers with no baffles.  If you play them softly, you can make them sound similar.  But at higher volumes, their character comes out in the higher partials.
