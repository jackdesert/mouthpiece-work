            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m not going to install this app, so what I am saying is flying blind, 
so to speak, concerning details. For one thing, there is reed compliance 
to take into account. The volume must include the volume occupied by the 
vibrating reed. I don&#39;t know if this was done--it is very difficult to 
measure this volume. There are other factors that need to be taken into 
account as well. One is that the "cone" of the saxophone is not 
ideal--most all saxes consist three separate conic sections: the neck, 
the main body (which is not always a straight cone anyway), and the 
bow/bell. Also, the compliance introduced by the tone holes changes the 
effective bore profile. Finally, there are mechanical reed effects, and 
impedance issues with the upstream resonator in the oral cavity which 
change the frequency at which the reed vibrates relative to the 
theoretical ideal. And doubly finally, temperature and the gas 
composition of the breath also affect the pitch.

 Toby, do you have any figures for what the magnitude of the typical Reed position correction is?  Are we talking 1 ml, .5 ml?

Beyond that, it depends on facing and reed strength. According to what I 
have read, it is not at all inconsequential. For example, relaxing the 
embouchure lowers the pitch of the sounding note--in large part because 
that increases the effective volume under the vibrating reed, although 
probably there are mechanical reed effects involved as well.

The best way, IMO, is to reverse engineer this: when the sax is playing 
in tune (as designed and at the correct temperature) you know that the 
internal volume is correct ;)

            <pre class='message__body'>The effects of volume/frequency discrepancies, even slight cases, are readily predictable and identifiable.  In the end, as Benade so appropriately pointed out, no matter how exact and/or complicated your measuring and calculating might be, you will still need to make fine adjustments to eliminate/minimize them for the individual player.  
In my experience, it is far more practical and effective to dispense with calculations completely and let the degree of scalar abberations and tonal instability themselves be the indicators of how close one is to an optimal mouthpiece match.  
The mouthpiece volume/missing cone ratio is not an exact 1/1 relationship.  The theory goes as far as to say, and rightly so, that it is an "approximate" relationship.  The experienced saxophonist doesn&#39;t play the numbers.  He plays the combined acoustical compromise, whatever that might be.  It is more than worthwhile to become aurally familiar with the scalar and tonal characteristics of the various degrees and directions of volume/frequency deviations.  Then you can tell instantly, without taking a single measurement or making one calculation, how well a mouthpiece matches a given horn and player.

My guess is that most of the players are classical style players with very tight embouchures.  I get this from looking at the type of mouthpieces listed.

Whatever bari they used, it most likely has some increased conicity compared to the less acute taper of the bari body (and bass - the larger the horn the less acute the body taper). Using the neck alone to determine the missing cone data will lead to some very inaccurate results.
