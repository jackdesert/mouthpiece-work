            <pre class='message__body'>Up for sale is a Phil Barone Hollywood #7 tenor mouthpiece made in 2002


The mouthpiece is in good condition except for a few surface scratches 
where the ligature has made contact. The biteplate is in very good shape since I use teeth patches.

I bought this a few months ago. Its is a very fine mouthpiece, but just not my cup of tea. It has a nice dark, full sound with good projection. Reminds me of an old New York Link on steroids. The workmanship is of excellent quality, typical of Phil Barone&#39;s work

This just the mouthpiece only, it came with no ligature or cap when I bought it. I found a hard rubber soprano sax ligature works just fine.

I would like to get $300 but will take any reasonable offer.

Please contact me either at taylor_chad@..., or my cellphone at 815-343-2492

                         Best Regards, 
                          Chad Taylor
