            <pre class='message__body'>Hey, guys - here&#39;s a little tip - for any one that isn&#39;t already 
using one: buy an optivisor! These are fantastic aids for mouthpiece 
work!

I ordered one and just got it the other day - wow, I can see again!
:-)

I&#39;m using one the I bought at www.contenti.com (jewelry and 
metalsmithing tools) - called a Three Lens Multi-magnifier - 
and reasonably priced at $19.90.

From the Contenti web site:

"These magnifiers have 3 lenses: one binocular lens, a second 
binocular lens behind the first that flips up, and a pivoting loupe. 
Using different combinations of these lenses, 4 magnifications are 
possible: 1.8X, 2.3X, 3.7X, and 4.8X."

Here&#39;s a link:

Pete
