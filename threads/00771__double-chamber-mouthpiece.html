The `Emanon&#39; 
A revolutionary New Mouthpiece Design
The first new design for saxophone mouthpieces in over half a 
century. This is the only mouthpiece that works on the principle of a 
double chamber; indeed, there are two baffles and two chambers. Each 
mouthpiece is hand made and the baffle and chamber designs are 
integral to the mouthpiece facing - unlike mass produced models. 
There is a total clarity of sound, especially at soft volume levels 
even in the very high extreme registers, with equality of tonal 
response. The two chamber principle offering unlimited volume without 
any tonal distortion. Fully tested in public at the Frankfurt Trade 
Fair by world class saxophonists, the praise was immediate and 
totally unreserved. The hand making process is naturally slow and 
limits quantity, however, you may test models which are available at 
the shop in our testing rooms.

just a distinct change in geometry partway through their chamber.  Rovner

Some old mouthpieces were called double chambers, like the Conn Comet. 
They have a squeeze throat, like Selmers, followed by a bulb shape, like Caravans.

anyway, that was touted as having a "double chamber" looked a bit 
like a swimming pool indentation in the larger chamber.

Interesting I went to the Dawkes site, couldnt find pictures of the 
Emanon piece anywhere,. some nice shots of the exterior of the bldg, 
the sax diplays etc, but not one picture of one mpc, maybe I wasn&#39;t 
looking in the right place??

I wonder just how much a "double chamber" of any configuration would affect the tone of the instrument, aside from whatever effect a change in air flow resistance might provide. It sounds more like voodoo than anything else (to me, anyway).

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, we know that different baffle heights and chamber sizes definitely affect the tone. The question is whether having a mpc with a chamber that is composed of two discrete components that equal a certain volume really sounds or responds much differently than a mpc with a single chamber of the same volume. I&#39;ve never read about any objective tests of such a thing. Apparently you can make a conical bore (like a sax) out of a bunch of stepped cylinders and it will still work, so it seems that the air column sort of "averages" out the dimensions of the cone, ignoring the steps for the most part. If that is also true for a mpc (and I don&#39;t see why it shouldn&#39;t be) then voodoo is probably the correct word. Or maybe "gimmick"....

  I wonder just how much a "double chamber" of any configuration would affect the tone of the instrument, aside from whatever effect a change in air flow resistance might provide. It sounds more like voodoo than anything else (to me, anyway).

Unlike other mass produced mouthpieces that are faced from one blank serving

            <pre class='message__body'>The Conn Comet I brought up was one of the pieces Wyman studied.  That is
the one with the squeeze throat then it opens up to a bulb that is bigger
than the bore for the cork.  This piece had some good points, but not in
proportion to the difficulty in making the piece.  At least that is my
impression.

That is the problem with all odd-ball mouthpiece ideas.  Is the benefit
worth the manufacturing effort and the high selling price?

            <pre class='message__body'>I think the triple rail with 2 equal chambers side-by-side was its own
thing.  Most of these other "dual chamber" concepts elude to an upstream
and downstream chamber.  One in the baffle area, one in the throat.  Or one
before the throat and one after.  Its just a way of hanging a marketing
name on their geometry.  Is a squeeze throat design actually a triple
chamber?  Large-small-large?

            <pre class='message__body'>I mentioned the Triple Rail a few posts back.  What would be interesting 
would be to take a Triple Rail and build some baffle into one side only.  At 
first, that&#39;s what I thought the Emanon might be.
