            <pre class='message__body'>I wanted to drop a quick note to say that I've been able to use LibreOffice to display and edit Mojo's facing curve spreadsheets. I've had success on systems running Windows 10 and Linux Mint 18.
 

 Here are some tips and caveats:
 Download LibreOffice from libreoffice.org and install it.
 Install Java JRE from www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp. I had to install the 32-bit version of Java because LibreOffice complained that I had a bad version of Java installed when I tried to run the non-linear Solver plugin with the 64-bit version of Java. I believe that it is possible to install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Java at the same time, but I haven't tried it.
 When you open one of Mojo's Excel files, the axis labels on the facing plots will be in a very small font. This is easy to change. Be sure to load the Excel files and then save them in the OpenDocument .ods format so that you don't have to tweak things each time you load them. In other words, it is easiest to work in the .ods format when using Calc. I haven't tried opening the ods files in Excel to see have well it it works with OpenDocument formats. It seems like the Windows version of LibreOffice came with the non-linear Solver plug-ins installed, but the Linux version did not. Refer to the following to install the nonlinear Solver plugin if you are running Linux: https://www.libreoffice.org/assets/Uploads/EN-Documents/Installingextensions.pd https://www.libreoffice.org/assets/Uploads/EN-Documents/Installingextensions.pdff, https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/79526/non-linear-solver-doesnt-show-up-in-calc/ https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/79526/non-linear-solver-doesnt-show-up-in-calc/ If the nonlinear Solver isn't enabled by default, go to Tools->Extension Manager to enable it. About Solver:
 Solver is needed in some spreadsheets to calculate the curve radius "R" and length "M". Unfortunately, the Solver parameters are lost from the xls file when it is loaded into LibreOffice Calc. You have to add the target cell (labelled Err or Sum err) and the changed cells (labelled R and M) in the Solver dialog. It can take quite a while for the non-linear Solver function to compute results and stops when "stagnated". Just accept the results if the "err" cells are zero and the curve data looks reasonable.
 

 I hope this helps folks that want to use Mojo's incredible spreadsheets but don't have access to Microsoft Office.

I tried some of the free spreadsheets a few years ago.  But I gave up on them when their version of the Solver did not work for me.  I did not try some things to make them work like you did.  I just bit the bullet and use Office 365 now at $10/month.  

Congratulations and thanks for sharing your findings.
