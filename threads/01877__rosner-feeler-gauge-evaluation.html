            <pre class='message__body'>I recieved my "Rosner" feeler gauge set today.  I checked them out 
with my Micrometer and also remeasured my smaller sizes that I have 
from a stainless steel feeler gauge set.

The Rosner set is as good as any purchased set I have measured.  They 
all have some variation.  They typically can be off from the marked 
size by up to .0005".  They are typically parallel within .0002".  
These measurement are somewhat subjective since I&#39;m eyeballing a 
Micrometer marked in .001" increments.  But I have a lot of 
experiance doing this.

I uploaded a file with my evaluation in the Files Tools area called 
"Feelers.xls".

As Jeff suggested, I&#39;ll be lightly sanding the edges of the new set 
as they are sharper than I can use as-is.

Thanks again Jeff, these are great!

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, 
Thanx for the unbiased evaluation...I have measured three sets, and 
they are identical to within about .0002" (as good as I can measure 
in my home shop). So, if we ALL use these feelers (hint, hint) our 
facing comparisons will be excellent.

I will minimize the commercial, and just point anyone curious for 
these gages to:

I will post this in the Links section under Tools.

thanx again, jeff
