            <pre class='message__body'>I have just finished a metal Berg. It was one of those with the"lake" 
in it right from the tip. It was a 95/1/sms. After refacing to 110 thou 
with 24 mil length and straightening and polishing the baffle , the 
piece plays very well but I would like it to have a bit more balls in 
the bottom end.  It has a bullet chamber.
Would altering the chamber to be more like a Guardala Brecker make the 
bottom end thicker?
Thanks
Ross McIntyre

            <pre class='message__body'>The Berg 1 chamber has a fairly narrow bore (or chamber as some call
it) after the &#39;bullet&#39; which contributes to its focussed tone quality.
 You would need to find a way of enlarging the bore to fatten up the
bottom end, which I think would be difficult . . .

Andrew
