            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m sure that many members of this list attend the upcoming music shows and
conferences. I would be pleased and honored to meet as many of you as
possible and shake your hand. I&#39;ll be at the Midwest Conference in Chicago
next week; the IAJE in New York in January, the Winter NAMM show in Anaheim
in January, and the TMEA show in San Antonio in February. I&#39;ll be at the
Orpheus Music booth and would really appreciate the opportunity to put some
faces with the names I see on this list!

The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
