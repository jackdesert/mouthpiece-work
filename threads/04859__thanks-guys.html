            <pre class='message__body'>It has been several years sence I have posted on this thread. I just 
wanted to thank you for the recommendations you have made in the 
past. I was looking for superior tone for my clarinet, and found it 
after stumbling on this web group. I have tried several mouthpieces 
and have come to the conclusion that there is not "much" difference 
until you go for the original Kaspar and Chadaveilles. I have not 
bought the new reproductions (Kaspar copies) yet, but may give them 
a try. I have found a pure, dark, classical tone with the high end, 
original pieces. THey are worth every pennie IMO

Now I am looking for that classic Jazz tone. The raspy, woody tone 
found in the old New Orlean&#39;s recordings. Not necceserely " Artie 
Shaw, or Pete Fountain". But a no name street player. That raspy 
woody tone. So Cool. I bought a Jody Jazz #8 piece this week and 
hope that will loosen it up a bit. It was recommended to use Saprano 
sax reeds from someone on this board, cuz "de got mo meat on um". 
They DO change the tone, but something else is missing from what I 
am looking for.

The quest continues!


Reguards,

Coop

I guess it was you who gave the recommendations. I remember now 
looking for the Meyer&#39;s and gave up. None to be found. Any idea on 
who might have one stashed away somewhere? I would guess they are 
old rubber style as well?
