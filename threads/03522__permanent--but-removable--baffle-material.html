I suppose that perhaps greasing the "mold" beforehand might let you get it out after hardening, but I&#39;m not sure.

Plexiglas is extremely durable stuff and handles filing and sanding quite nicely. It&#39;s become the de facto standard (instead of buffalo horn) to make the sharp blowing edge of shakuhachi flutes. It takes an edge and doesn&#39;t splinter or wear out for years in the presence of saliva. It is also much harder than epoxy putty. I would guess that it is the better choice, but it will take some work to get it to the right shape.

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] permanent (but removable) baffle material


  I&#39;m looking to create a removable permanent baffle for my rubber Link, 
  but I believe epoxy putty gives off a lot of heat in hardening, which 
  I&#39;m afraid would damage the rubber.  I have a feeling plexiglass might 
  work quite nicely; does it deal well with filing, or does it crack, 
  splinter, etc.?  I would prefer to deal with something soft and 
  moldable, though.

  I&#39;ve been using dental wax, but naturally, it changes shape slightly 
  every time it goes in and out of the mouthpiece, and I&#39;m getting sick 
  of trying to re-perfect it every time.

Toby, your casting idea sounds very interesting.  I&#39;m afraid I have
almost no knowledge of this sort of thing, so how would I make the
mold?

Does poster putty dry in place if left for a long time, or does it
remain tacky indefinitely?

Toby, your casting idea sounds very interesting.  I&#39;m afraid I have
almost no knowledge of this sort of thing, so how would I make the
mold?

Aha! I&#39;m not sure...

There seem to be lots of resources on the net. Check out:

http://www.smooth-on.com/howto.htm

http://www.hirstarts.com/casting/plastic.html

for starters. Google up "casting resin" and "mold making" for more.

It should be an easy project and you wouldn&#39;t need much of either molding 
rubber/plastic or casting resin.
