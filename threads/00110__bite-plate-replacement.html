            <pre class='message__body'>Hard rubber is too soft.  What I suggest is getting a cheap student
mouthpiece, such as the �Bundy Plastic Special� from Woodwind and
Brasswind (I think it is still about $6).  You can rough cut the beak
from this mouthpiece with a cutting blade on a Dremel, a razor saw,
bandsaw, etc.  Then it is a matter of grinding and shaping.

As you shape it, keep the piece cool, cutting material away slowly,
dipping in water, etc.  Otherwise, you will melt the plastic.

A piece of smoke or colored plexiglass or acrylic, from a glass shop, is
also a good material to work with.

Once the piece is shaped to fit, sand it with 600 silicon carbide paper,
then 800, 1000, and finally, 1500.  Now buff to a shine with a cloth
wheel on your Dremel tool, using a slow speed, some compound, and
perhaps a little water.  Kit Scratch-Out, from an auto store, will work
well for this.  You can also use Colgate white toothpaste (not the green
gel type) and a little water, as this has a mild abrasive.  Work slowly,
not allowing the plastic to heat and melt.  Do not apply pressure, keep
the cloth buff moving, do not hold in one place, easy does it!  The part
will soon shine brightly.

The plastic can be glued in with thick, gel type CA glue.  You can also
use my favorite (you know I have to say it�) E6000 craft glue.  This is
also sold as Alene�s 7800 (in craft stores) and Goop Automotive Sealant
and Adhesive.  All the same stuff.

Finally, I like to finish it off with a clear mouthpiece patch.
