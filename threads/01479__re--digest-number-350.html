You know it was Celluloid plastic that I was thinking about, and just came to that realization about two seconds after hitting the send button. I hate it when that happens! I&#39;ll just retreat back to my corner and shut up now :)

            <pre class='message__body'>RE: Bakelite

Michael, Come out of your corner.  I was going to ask If you were thinking of Celluloid but of course didn&#39;t. 20 years ago I use to work for Underwriters&#39; Labs and test Plastics and one program was for srewdriver or tool handles to make sure they were NOT made from Cellulose Nitrate.  Seems like back in the 30 and 40&#39;s, there were problems with guys having screwdrivers catch on fire so that&#39;s why UL got involed with the testing.  I don&#39;t think you can even buy the stuff any more.

To bring the above around to insturments, I have a small scewdriver in my bari case from the 30 or 40&#39;s with the handle made from cellulose nitrate.  I don&#39;t know where I got it but I knew it was old but it was just the right size for emergency screw tightening.  The handle is in bad shape and a piece was ready to crack off so I put it in an ash tray and lit it. Burned up lite jet fuel!  So don&#39;t use cellulose nitrate for barrels!

            <pre class='message__body'>Celluloid... yes... during the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, it was 
found the Afghans were buying lots of old movie film.  Turns out they 
had lots of little old ladies cutting it up into little slivers with 
scissors, and soaking it in (deleted on purpose, you chemists know 
what), to make smokeless powder for reloading ammo.
