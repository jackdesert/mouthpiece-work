            <pre class='message__body'>I belong to a "maker studio" coop where I have access to 3D printers.  I&#39;ve
programmed a few clarinet tuning barrels.  They typically take 2-hours of
machine time to print.  The plastic goes down molten and cools  --and
shrinks.

I&#39;ve been keeping close track of the ratio of finished size to "design
size."  Typically, the tuning barrel sockets come out considerably smaller
than what I&#39;ve told the machine to make.

That means that there is considerable hand work required just to size the
barrel sockets. The plastic is much harder than wood, so sanding or
scraping the sockets to size is a slow process.  I think that with more
test prints I should be able to have the printed part fit the corks without
hand work, but typically the printed barrels take more work than a lathed
wooden barrel.
