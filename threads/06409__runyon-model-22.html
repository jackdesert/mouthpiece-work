            <pre class='message__body'>I recently was given an old plastic alto piece to copy. The piece had a 
crack through the middle. The piece resmbled the Runyon 22&#39;s that I had 
purchased from Paul some time ago.  The bight was smaller and the 
chamber was slightly more oval than up and down. There was a slight 
rollover and the baffle did not have as much downturn as the modern 
22&#39;s.  The piece was quite old and played ok. 
The thing that got me was the tone. Very full in the top with no 
thinness and the bottom and middle register&#39;s were extremely rich. The 
tone was nothing like a Meyer. Possibly somewhere between a Meyer and a 
very rich very sweet Selmer.
I went through three of my blanks trying to match the sound and nearly 
got there in the end.  Could this be an original Runyon 22?
Thanks
Ross McIntyre
