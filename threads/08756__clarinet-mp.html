            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Bill:

The 5JB is a jazz model with a more open facing. The one that I worked measured .057" which is pretty open for most clarinet players tastes.  The B45 is a medium facing.

As this is a fairly large difference on clarinet, it rather goes against Vandoren&#39;s reputation for the accuracy of their product.
Maybe they have bad days like everyone else.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Vandoren measures openings at the very tip and I measure to the inside of the tip rail.  So this can explain .057" vs .054".   Vandoren is probably within +/- .001" of their target.  

Measuring at the very tip is much more difficult to take accurately.  You need a gage with a pointed probe and you must sneak up to the tip without falling off the edge.  It is even more difficult with calipers and not possible with a wand or flat probe machinist depth gage.

 Thanks for the explanation Keith. I should have remembered that you have mentioned this before. I agree with measuring at the inside  of the tip rail, as it is easier and more precise. Vandoren give the length as 22mm, compared to your measurement with a .0015" feeler of 18mm. Again their tendency to measure at extreme points, gives a false impression of the lay when compared to other makes. It now looks less extreme and closer to ones I have made and like.  
 Eddie.
