The double embouchure has been used by many different players over 
the years, I even heard a rumor that Coltrane used a double 
embouchure at some point...

I know many clarinet players who use double

            <pre class='message__body'>0Downside ... is stability. The downside of the double is that the
support for the instrument is weaker and therefore in highly technical
passages, especially where you have very few fingers on the
instriment, it becomes a problem to play a lot of notes and keep the
horn from moving all around. This is particularly true when stanging
up. At clarinetfest 2003 in Salt Lake I actually saw a double-lip
clarinettist play a solo concerto with an orchestra while sitting down
so she could put the bell of the clarinet on her knee for stability.
