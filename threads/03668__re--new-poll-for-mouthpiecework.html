All of the listed attributes play an important role in the playability of the mpc--if any of them are seriously out of spec it is going to create problems.

I don&#39;t get the point.

Although I can appreciate the passion some of you feel for the 
subject I can only say how this only proves one thing... 
Saxophonists are a strange bunch and mouthpieces are such an 
individual and personal decision that no one will convince me that 
any one particular mouthpiece is better than another because if that 
were the case there would be no need for more than one company 
making them..

                             I only posted this poll as a way to spur some conversation. It 
 wasn&#39;t intended to be biased at all nor to leave anyone out. 
 Although I can appreciate the passion some of you feel for the 
 subject I can only say how this only proves one thing... 
 Saxophonists are a strange bunch and mouthpieces are such an 
 individual and personal decision that no one will convince me that 
 any one particular mouthpiece is better than another because if that 
 were the case there would be no need for more than one company 
 making them..

            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

My thoughts-- I think this is the mission of this group that Keith 
set up- to teach us and to share with each other about how to make 
good mouthpieces.

Now that Keith and many of you experts have taught me how to "fish," 
I don&#39;t buy specialty pieces. I am not proclaiming that I am an 
expert refacer, far from it.  I just like working on things. I work 
on my own horns and rebuild vintage ones. I enjoy working on my own 
mouthpieces and getting them to play the way I want them to play.

I am also not knocking the mouthpiece vendors; I know many of them 
are here reading this list. There will always be a market for those 
that do not know how to work on pieces, do not have the time to work 
on pieces, or have no interest in the matter-they just want to play.

For me, I have never played any of the brands and vendors mentioned. 
I grew up pretty poor and could never afford a nice, branded 
mouthpiece. Even now, I look for no-name mouthpieces or "student" 
pieces, or nice vintage HR pieces at bargain prices. They make great 
blanks to work on.

Thanks, Keith and all those on the list for empowering me to enjoy my 
playing experience.

-Willis
