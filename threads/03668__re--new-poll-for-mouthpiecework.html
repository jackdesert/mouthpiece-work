            <pre class='message__body'>Guys, isn&#39;t this a bit stupid? Isn&#39;t this like asking what plays a more vital role in making a car go: the engine or the wheels or the transmission or the axle? Or what is more important physiologically for the body: the heart, the lungs, the kidneys or the brain?

All of the listed attributes play an important role in the playability of the mpc--if any of them are seriously out of spec it is going to create problems.

I don&#39;t get the point.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby, I agree.  I have seen chamber/baffle shapes that make a facing 
feel as if it is smaller or larger than it really is.  All of the 
components must work together for a good result.

Saxophonists are a strange bunch and mouthpieces are such an

            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

My thoughts-- I think this is the mission of this group that Keith 
set up- to teach us and to share with each other about how to make 
good mouthpieces.

Now that Keith and many of you experts have taught me how to "fish," 
I don&#39;t buy specialty pieces. I am not proclaiming that I am an 
expert refacer, far from it.  I just like working on things. I work 
on my own horns and rebuild vintage ones. I enjoy working on my own 
mouthpieces and getting them to play the way I want them to play.

I am also not knocking the mouthpiece vendors; I know many of them 
are here reading this list. There will always be a market for those 
that do not know how to work on pieces, do not have the time to work 
on pieces, or have no interest in the matter-they just want to play.

For me, I have never played any of the brands and vendors mentioned. 
I grew up pretty poor and could never afford a nice, branded 
mouthpiece. Even now, I look for no-name mouthpieces or "student" 
pieces, or nice vintage HR pieces at bargain prices. They make great 
blanks to work on.

Thanks, Keith and all those on the list for empowering me to enjoy my 
playing experience.

-Willis
