            <pre class='message__body'>Arrrrrr, when were these made? I had one just like the one shown in the
listing photos, but I bought it new back close to 30 years ago. Threw it
into the case as an afterthought when I traded my Yani-stenciled Whitehall
in for a friggin&#39; flute. Arrrrrrrrr..........

        I own 2 off these , a 8* and a 5 .  I offered one for sale on Ebay in 2002 , it did not even reached $300 which was my reserve.
        The 8* is hard work on soprano, but I get lots of compliments. I considered having the 5 opened to 6* .... Should
        I rather sell it and look for a 6* ?
        Mouthpiece Heaven bought a 10* slant signature tenor (like new) mouthpiece from me (ebay) for  $440 . The 
        winning bid was reached on the first day of the auction.   I think THEO is a great guy to do business with.

well known mouthpiece gurus pay that much for a
mouthpiece that they could probably create themselves?

Is their plan to do just that: duplicate the design?

both Theo and Phil bid big bucks on old Links in good condition.  Phil is a
