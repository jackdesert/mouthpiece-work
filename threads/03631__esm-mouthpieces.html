            <pre class='message__body'>I just accquired an ESM Jazz 7* mouthpiece. Does anyone know anything 
about this mouthpieces reputation. It is a hard rubber mouthpiece with 
a metal band around the shank. It has a pretty substantial raised 
baffle as well. I am wondering if I could have this baffle taken down 
more similar to the Branford model Guardala as well as round out the 
chamber and inner walls as well.. It doesn&#39;t seem to be very well 
finished. Has anyone had any experiences with these type of pieces, 
and if so, could it be worked on to accomplish what I am looking for 
very easy. Please offer any suggestions that you can. Thank you so 
much for your time.

            <pre class='message__body'>The ESM web site is in the Links area.  Not that that helps.  There 
are no pics of the chamber.  I have not worked on an ESM.

Modifying the mouthpiece comes down to tools, ability, risk, and 
reward.  High speed roarty tools are nice for chamber and sidewall 
work, especially with a flex shaft and a foot switch.  But HR pieces 
can be worked on with just hand files.  Riffler files are handy for 
curved work.

Other than that, I know nothing about them.
