Theo&#39;s web site is down.  Not sure what this means, maybe he didn&#39;t 
pay his service provider bill (hopefully). Can&#39;t find any obit info 
for him.  Let&#39;s hope he&#39;s on vacation and not in mouthpiece heaven.  
Theo we need you.

            <pre class='message__body'>OK here is the scoop.

Theo is alive and well....He is on vacation ..... He just got a new computer.

The web site should be up and running soon, if not already.

This is all info from his mother. My boss talked to her today. 

So J.w. go crawl back under your rock, HE IS NOT DEAD.

OK here is the scoop.

Theo is alive and well....He is on vacation ..... He just got a new computer.

The web site should be up and running soon, if not already.

This is all info from his mother. My boss talked to her today. 

So J.w. go crawl back under your rock, HE IS NOT DEAD.

            <pre class='message__body'>As I said in a n earlier email I had asked Theo for some advice about a mouthpiece that had gone sour (tasting, horrible chemical taste) and he responded to that inquiry. then a couple of weeks later someone else replied to my request withthe news that Theo had passed away. Unfortunately, I deleted theat note along with many others in cleaning up my mailbox so I don&#39;t know who it was that responded. Thus wwhen I saw the inquiry from someone asking for info re Theo I innoicently passed on what I had heard. I am sorry that it has contributed to the confusion.
