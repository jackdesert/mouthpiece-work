            <pre class='message__body'>As I said in a n earlier email I had asked Theo for some advice about a mouthpiece that had gone sour (tasting, horrible chemical taste) and he responded to that inquiry. then a couple of weeks later someone else replied to my request withthe news that Theo had passed away. Unfortunately, I deleted theat note along with many others in cleaning up my mailbox so I don&#39;t know who it was that responded. Thus wwhen I saw the inquiry from someone asking for info re Theo I innoicently passed on what I had heard. I am sorry that it has contributed to the confusion.
