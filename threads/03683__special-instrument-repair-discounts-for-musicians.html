Steve Goodson Woodwinds LLC in New Orleans will discount ALL hurricane
related repairs and restorations 50% off our published prices as soon as we
are able to reopen. We have additional technicians standing by to join our
staff as soon as we are able to restore our equipment (which was flooded)
and restock our supplies. This discount applies ONLY to hurricane related
damage. Visit our website, www.saxgourmet.com for overhaul prices (deduct
50%) and options. 
 
Questions? email me at steveg@.... 
 
We suffered VERY substantial losses ourself, and lots of people and
companies have graciously and compassionately helped us out. We feel like
this is the least we can do, and encourage other repair facilities to do
likewise.
