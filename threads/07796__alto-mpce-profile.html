If you don&#39;t have an alto piece you like, it&#39;s hard to figure out where
you&#39;re at. What have you been playing on? What reeds also?

What are the mp&#39;s you have? It sounds like they are no-name stock pieces.
What are their facings?  Often this type of piece has a very narrow facing,
as they are intended for beginners with weak embouchures.

You can practice opening them up a bit, and see how that goes. I should add
that the hardest thing to do is (IMO) creating a good facing curve that
works well. Tiny changes make big differences.

After that, the profile of the baffle just behind the tip rail is also very
influential on how the mouthpiece blows. Again, small changes make big
differences. When you open up a piece, the curvature of the baffle as it
goes to the tip rail is changed, and needs to be adjusted. That is also a
sensitive area, where small changes can make a big difference (and one can
get improvements up to a point, and then get diminishing returns!)

IIRC there are some alto facing schedules on the Yahoo mouthpiecework site -
although they may be buried in the postings.

Tastes vary - but if you&#39;re looking for more bottom end, my impression of
the Dukoff has been that they have they have a cutting sound due to the high
baffle. However, tastes vary, and sound is also a function of the reed one
plays.)

            <pre class='message__body'>There are a couple of good alto facing spreadsheets in the files section.  But you need to be good at using MS Excel to get the most out of them.

If you have never found a mouthpiece that you like, I would suggest you find one first, then you can try to copy its features and measurements over to some of your blanks.

You do want to consider using long facings (44-48) and whatever tip opening feels comfortable to you.  A radial facing would be free-blowing.

You do not seem to have tried enough mouthpieces to know if large chamber or small chamber is what you like.  Baffles too.  You seem to be leaning towards a Dukoff D style, but you may prefer a Link style mouthpiece.  Or instead of either extreme, something in the middle...

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks all, good info. I&#39;ll check out the recommended sites. The mp&#39;s I have are a variety of HR and plastic, some good, some not. I buy, repair, and sell horns, they came in the case. I play tenor using a VAndoren S HR and an Silver STM LInk, both refaced by Keith B., Great pces. I am going to use the proportions and baffle etc from these, scaled down as a start. See what happens.
I&#39;m not really tied to getting the bottom end I&#39;m more on a mission to get one that plays as freely
as my tenor pces. With this in mind I might get all of what I need.
Thanks again guys.

            <pre class='message__body'>Portallatro> Recently I discovered some of my problems getting a beefy 
low end are caused by a playing problem. Instead of remaining static, my 
tongue wants to move down for low notes. When I don&#39;t change my tongue 
position, low notes speak much better. A longer facing helps low notes 
to speak. I like the 4C. It is the best student MPC on the planet. A 
Beechler Tuffite is an interesting student MPC. The Tuffite has some 
vintage meyer characteristics. I&#39;ll be putting both up for sale on ebay 
in coming weeks.
