What would be the best practice to passivate the surface of a gold plated brass mouthpiece after it has been refaced?
1) Do nothing and let natural oxidation occur2) Spot re-plate copper followed by silver then gold over the exposed area -table, rails and baffle3) Electroplate the entire piece with rhodium which I believe will stick to all exposed metals involved; brass, silver and gold
I believe plating should add about  2microns of material -less than 0.1 mill and should not affect the refacing work.
Thanks for the info,
Marco

If they want it replated, the old plating is stripped off by the plater using a reverse electroplating process.  Then new plating is usually copper, silver, gold.  Sometimes nickel instead of silver.

It&#39;s worth noting that nickel allergy is not at all uncommon, and
prolonged exposure may trigger sensitization; I would advise against
nickel plating a mouthpiece, however nice looking and durable it might
be.
