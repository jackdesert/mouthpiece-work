>Hello Griff,
I too am a newbie but I confess to have been lurking around here for 
quite some time!
I have just aquired an old Selmer (London) Clarinet.It is 
inscribed "Student Console" and underneath "Foreign" s/n 343032.
I wondered if you or anyone else might be able to throw some light 
on the mpc that came with it.It is inscribed "Calteau" also the 
marks &#39;2&#39; and &#39;made in England&#39;Any info will be appreciated.

Regards Peter

Hello Pete & Griff,
Pete, your Console is a large bore clarinet from the 50&#39;s. 
The Calteau&#39;s I used in 1958 were ivory coloured hard plastic costing
about Â£2 sterling then. 
I remember they came in tip openings 1/2/3 and I found them rather
close for Jazz, resulting in my first crude attempts at refacing, on a
smooth doorstep at RAF Nicosia, Cyprus.
With all the info available here, I would not recommend this approach
today.         Eddie.
