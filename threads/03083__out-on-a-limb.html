Seems I cant leave well enough alone.  I straighted out my metal 
piece but the facing was still short and it blew real stuffy.  I 
lengthed the facing but transposed some numbers and blew the curve.  
I lengthed it again to correct the problem but it played tubby  I had 
to mill down the table to get back to a resonable starting point.  
Now the facing is 23 instead of 20.  I used Keiths table for a 105 
and got pretty close...as close as I dare to mess with again.  It 
plays quite well.  I did some more thinning of the rails and the tip 
rail.  Not tubby but still a tad dark.  I may have to add a small 
baffle to add a bit of edge.
