            <pre class='message__body'>On behalf of Phat Reeds, I am very proud to announce that the legendary
SKIP MESQUITE has just signed on as our latest Endorsing Artist.  Skip
has been a friend for several years, and I must admit that I have a bad
case of "hero worship" for his playing. His input will be invaluable to
us as we strive to develop the very finest saxophone reeds available
anywhere, at any price.
 
Here are some highlights of Skip&#39;s impressive resume:
 
Back in the Day, on the mean streets of Oakland, CA., Skip Mesquite was
a part of one of the most Influential bands and horn sections of the
day, The Tower of Power. Skip is an original member and first in a long
line of lead tenor players and multi-Instrumentalists to head up that
famed horn section. After leaving the Tower of Power, Skip headed up
another Bay Area favorite, Cold Blood. His recording credits include:
Santana, Jennifer Warnes, Redbone, Tower of Power, Cold Blood, Doctor
Hook and the Medicine Show just to name a few. He has toured with
Deniece Williams and currently working with Lenny Williams, another
Tower of Power Alumnus. As a songwriter, Skip has placed songs with Greg
Adams and wrote a song on the latest Tower of Power CD "Oakland Zone".
Still located in the Oakland, CA. area, Skip is very active with
recording and live dates throughout the West Coast.
