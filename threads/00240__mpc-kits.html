            <pre class='message__body'>This morning, I received the following information from the Woodwind 
and Brasswind:  "Winslow Mpc/Reed Kit $195.00, these are on back 
order from Winslow and due here at anytime."

International Musical Suppliers carries the Morgan Mouthpiece 
Measuring Kit for $165.99.  The Woodwind and Brasswind is asking 
$148.00 for the same Morgan Kit and lists it as also being on 
backorder.

All things considered, I&#39;m going to opt out and start collecting the 
pieces and parts on my own, now that the information is much more 
clear, thanks to everyone participating here.

FYI:  my copy of Ronald Saska&#39;s Guide to Repairing Woodwinds arrived 
this afternoon and I&#39;ll browse it over the next few days to see if it 
has anything else I can contribute from it&#39;s appendices of suppliers, 
etc.

            <pre class='message__body'>There is no substitute for some of the tools in the Winslow kitï¿½
specifically the glass gauge and the dial indicator tip opening gauge.
I encourage you to wait and get that.

Yes, start collecting mouthpieces now.
