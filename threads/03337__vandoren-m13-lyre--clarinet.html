            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

I&#39;ve got a client that wants a mouthpiece with the M13 Lyre facing.  
Does anyone know what the facing length and tip opening are supposed 
to be on this mouthpiece?  Thanks.

Ben

            <pre class='message__body'>Thw WW&BW chart lists a M13 as a .040" tip opening.  I may have an older
Vandoren brochure that has the specs.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have access to new Vandoren pieces, and I may already have some M13 
lyre specs. 

The chart with clarinet facings that was compiled from data I posted 
here has the regular M13 on it.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a chart I printed from IntMusicalSupplies a few years ago.  It lists
a M13L as 1.03mm tip and 36 L.
