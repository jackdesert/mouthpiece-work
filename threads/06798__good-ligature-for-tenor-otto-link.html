            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m on a Otto Link NY 7 that I had the same problem with since college. Recently got a Ultimate Ligature. Best thing that could have happened to me. Check out www.myspace.com/jazzsax1906 to hear how it sounds. Very resonant. My former jazz professor at USM used a oleg ligature on his 70ish STM. About a 6 or 6* I believe. Beautiful huge sound that was quite versatile also. Look him up.....guy named Larry Panella. Im sure there&#39;s a mp3 with his sound on it. Or then again there&#39;s also the ol&#39; school route.....selmer ligature thats big enough and bend it onto the mouthpiece. Never fails. I&#39;ve seen Joshua Redman(I think) as well as others use this technique in the past. Let me know how it goes.

My screw type ligature is not holding the reed flat on the table - I can slide .0015" feeler all the way down to the table. I have tried other reeds too.

            <pre class='message__body'>Try other ligatures like Rico H, Olegature, Brancher or Selmer. If the table
is flat FL Ultimate will work to.

            <pre class='message__body'>The ligatures for Link metal mouthpieces are notorious for this.  If you look closely at your reed, you will probably notice a circular indentation in the center of it, right where the screw hits it.  Of course, the screw is not SUPPOSED to hit it, but the outer four parts that ARE supposed to have bent through use and now the reed is being held down only at the center.  You can bent the ligature&#39;s reed plate back into its correct shape, or try another ligature.  I use an Rovner Eddie Daniels model on mine.

  What does work beautifully is a  ligature for  a Selmer metal piece. You can form the ridge as on a Link by tightening the ligature onto the mouthpiece, with the reed on, and  then using a squared -off piece of hardwood to shape it. Don&#39;t use a piece of metal. It  will leave ugly marks on the ligature.   Peter Deley --

Agreed, the link ligatures completely useless.  The selmer ligatures for metal mouthpieces fit older vintage links but they will not fit the newer links.  I had a new link that i didn&#39;t particularly care for so i decided to experiment.  I filed off the ridge on the top of the mouthpiece and the selmer ligature fit perfectly.  It kind of took a while but it was worth it because now i actually kind of like that mouthpiece.  The new links are a discussion in themselves, terribly inconsistent.
