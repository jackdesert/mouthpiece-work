Written in 2001, I have found this article an interesting alternative to Runyon&#39;s method of determining embouchure support.  Mr. Duke cites many experiences in correcting tight embouchures which he calls "high pitch centers".  My guess is that these players often come as clarinetists who have switched to sax and/or as players who have been encouraged to play harder and harder reeds as their embouchure muscles have developed.

He describes the most common problem to be flat low notes and sharp high notes.  He suggests that the player needs to relax their embouchure until they are playing flat and push the mouthpiece in farther (though he says push in first then loosen up).  

Hopefully most of us here are past the point where this type of adjustment would help us.  But maybe not or maybe you know some players who could benefit from trying this.  

When faced with a player complaining of sharp high notes and/or flat notes, I usually suggest they try a smaller chamber mouthpiece and pull out some.  I even suggest some temporary putty in their current mouthpiece to test the suggestion.  Perhaps I should suggest reading this article too as a second opinion.  

While not a technical acoustics article, it is interesting fodder for discussion.

Thanks Keith.  That is one of my favorite essays on saxophone tuning.  It is interesting that he refers to mouthpiece pitch in a general way but does not go so far as to give a specific pitch on each size of saxophone.

Using his suggestions for tuning, I have come up with my own variation which is to check the tuning of written F# (on all saxes) in the first and second octaves, and then fingering low B over blow to the the second overtone F#(without octave key) and find the embouchure pressure and mouthpiece position that gives the closest match to all three F#&#39;s.  In tuning the short tube F#2 and the long tube F#2 overblown from the sounding length of the low B it really locks in the pitch throughout the registers for me.

            <pre class='message__body'>I started using F#1 and F#2 tuning on sop sax after I realized how much I could lip C2 and C3 all over the place.  I now use it on all sax sizes when play testing mouthpiece I have worked on.  But I have not incorporated low B.  I&#39;m going to start fiddle around with it on the next few mouthpieces I play test.
