            <pre class='message__body'>I have a tenor metal Link that was always kind of non-responsive, even
after putting on a nice even radial curve.  On a whim, I recently
decided to try straightening out the curve a bit from about half way
along the facing to the tip.  This seemed to make it play better and
easier than before.  Is this a good thing to do?  It doesn&#39;t seem to
have been discussed much here before.  I got this idea from an older
Guy Hawkins piece I came across and measured.

I find this result interesting, since the radial curve has worked well
for me on tenors Bergs that I have done in the past.

Regards,
Andrew

            <pre class='message__body'>If it sounds and feels good, it is good.

There are a number of non-radial curves that work.  I find elliptical
curves that get a tighter radius near the tip are also good.  It sounds
like you are trying something like an elliptical curve with a longer radius
as it approaches the tip.  I have had some good results with this type of
curve on clarinet and sop sax.  But I think I get better results not using
it on the bigger saxes.  But the curve you have may be something else.
