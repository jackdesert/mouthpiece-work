            <pre class='message__body'>Those of us who own multiple mouthpieces all know that there is a  
significant variation between brands in the diameter of the shank,  
resulting in poor fit for some on the neck and the lack of  
interchangeability without applying teflon tape or paper as a spacer.  
Even though this variation is slight, it is sufficient to cause  
problems. It is most unlikely that mouthpiece manufacturers will ever  
agree upon a standard diameter UNLESS some legitimate reason can be  
given to do so.

I got a complaint this morning from a customer who had purchased one  
of our mouthpieces and found that the shank diameter was larger than  
the mouthpieces he had previously used. I have also gotten complaints  
in the past that our mouthpieces were SMALLER than the mouthpiece the  
customer was using! This set me to thinking: is there an acoustic  
reason that one size is better than another? I can find nothing in my  
files which addresses this issue.

Chamber size I understand. I&#39;m speaking ONLY about the diameter of the  
shank itself with regard to the fit on the neck cork.

            <pre class='message__body'>It would be nice if someone would address the physics of this.  It seems to me that the greater the surface area @ the front of the tube, the more turbulance it would produce.  I think that to do the testing right, you would need a series of identical necks with differing thicknesses of cork, and a series of mouthpieces which were identical in all specs except shank diameter.

This actually brings up a bit of idle curiosity on my part.  Has anyone on this board had the opportunity to try/analyze the interchangeable venturi system developed by Ken Warburton?  It was brought about due to a request by his sax playing brother.  Ken&#39;s research of saxophone physics has led him to focus on the mouthpiece to horn connection or "initiation point" as he would say.

Like I said, just a bit of curiosity.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think you may all be thinking too hard on this.  Ideally, there should be a standard-size shank, designed to be a universal fit for all of each size of sax.  Even if there is variation in the sax neck sizes, that can be compensated for by cork.  The object is that a player could freely substitute one mouthpiece for another.  However, some mouthpiece makers, either through sloppiness or orneriness, mis-size their shanks.  I&#39;d like to believe it is just a matter of being off the specs a bit, but I suppose a maker COULD deliberately design his piece to be smaller or larger, necessitating the cork to be built up or shaved down to the point that it becomes difficult to try competing mouthpieces.  Of course, that also makes it difficult to try HIS mouthpiece, so...   I have a couple of Sugal acrylic mouthpieces that were essentially unfinished blanks when I got them.  They make playable mouthpieces, but the shanks are too large so they have gotten
 very little use.  Wrapping paper around the cork is a pain.
