It seems to me that the greater the surface area @ the front of the tube, the more turbulance it would produce.  I think that to do the testing right, you would need a series of identical necks with differing thicknesses of cork, and a series of mouthpieces which were identical in all specs except shank diameter.

This actually brings up a bit of idle curiosity on my part.  Has anyone on this board had the opportunity to try/analyze the interchangeable venturi system developed by Ken Warburton?  It was brought about due to a request by his sax playing brother.  Ken&#39;s research of saxophone physics has led him to focus on the mouthpiece to horn connection or "initiation point" as he would say.

Like I said, just a bit of curiosity.

 is that a player could freely substitute one mouthpiece for another.  However, some mouthpiece makers, either through sloppiness or orneriness, mis-size their shanks.  I&#39;d like to believe it is just a matter of being off the specs a bit, but I suppose a maker COULD deliberately design his piece
 to be smaller or larger, necessitating the cork to be built up or shaved down to the point that it becomes difficult to try competing mouthpieces.  Of course, that also makes it difficult to try HIS mouthpiece, so...   I have a couple of Sugal acrylic mouthpieces that were essentially unfinished
 blanks when I got them.  They make playable mouthpieces, but the shanks are too large so they have gotten
 very little use.  Wrapping paper around the cork is a pain.

I doubt turbulence enters into the equation at all, except where there are sharp edges. The air jet through the reed slit detaches from the reed channel within a cm or so of the tip and breaks up into vortexes, and there might be a slight difference depending on mpc design, but my guess is that
 the effect is minimal. Basically a larger shank is going to give more internal volume, necessitating pushing the mpc slightly further on the cork to get the tuning correct. There might be a just-noticeable difference in the harmonic spectrum (just guessing) due to the differing bore profile of
 the mpc, but my feeling is that it would be insignificant overall.

The Warburton system is interesting, and probably has a noticeable effect on intonation, timbre and response. If you want to play with an analog, take a bit of chewing gum (adequately chewed) and make a ring of it inside the end of your neck. Change the thickness and profile of the gum ring and
 see what happens.

It would be nice if someone would address the physics of this.  It seems to me that the greater the surface area @ the front of the tube, the more turbulance it would produce.  I think that to do the testing right, you would need a series of identical necks with differing thicknesses of cork, and
 a series of mouthpieces which were identical in all specs except shank diameter.
 
This actually brings up a bit of idle curiosity on my part.  Has anyone on this board had the opportunity to try/analyze the interchangeable venturi system developed by Ken Warburton?  It was brought about due to a request by his sax playing brother.  Ken&#39;s research of saxophone physics has led
 him to focus on the mouthpiece to horn connection or "initiation point" as he would say.
 
Like I said, just a bit of curiosity.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Shank Diameter

Those of us who own multiple mouthpieces all know that there is a significant variation between brands in the diameter of the shank, resulting in poor fit for some on the neck and the lack of interchangeability without applying teflon tape or paper as a spacer. Even though this variation is
 slight, it is sufficient to cause problems. It is most unlikely that mouthpiece manufacturers will ever agree upon a standard diameter UNLESS some legitimate reason can be given to do so.  


I got a complaint this morning from a customer who had purchased one of our mouthpieces and found that the shank diameter was larger than the mouthpieces he had previously used. I have also gotten complaints in the past that our mouthpieces were SMALLER than the mouthpiece the customer was using!
 This set me to thinking: is there an acoustic reason that one size is better than another? I can find nothing in my files which addresses this issue.


Chamber size I understand. I&#39;m speaking ONLY about the diameter of the shank itself with regard to the fit on the neck cork.
