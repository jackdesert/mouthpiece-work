ciao Keit,
I am sorry to write to you only now, but I am very busy (this is a 
bad bad time for me).
I have made a phone call to Mr. Rino Peverelli and he have said me 
that RIA is the old trademark for his products (totally hancrafted 
mouthpieces).  Now he sell his mpcs with Peverelli trademark. 
For more information: Peverelli Rino - Bocchini Per Strumenti 
Musicali 22100 Como (CO) - Via Paoli Pasquale, 27 ITALIA
Phone 031.524310  

RIA = Reed Instrument Accessories
Ciao Filippo
