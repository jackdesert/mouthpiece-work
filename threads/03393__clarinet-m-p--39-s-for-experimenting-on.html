            <pre class='message__body'>I can get a large number of plastic stock Buffet clarinet mouthpieces 
(with cap & lig) for the members of this group to play around with. The 
tips are about 1.25mm, but I&#39;ve taken down the table and refaced some 
to M13 specs with good results.

Anyone interested?

            <pre class='message__body'>I can probably lay my hands on about 30 pieces w/ligs - what do you 
think is a reasonable price for say lots of 5?
