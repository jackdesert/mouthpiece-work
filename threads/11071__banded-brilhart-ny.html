            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to band a tenor Great Neck NY Brilhart.  The Great Neck engraving is on the shank and all of the banding jobs that I&#39;ve seen would cover this up.  A lot of the banding jojobs that I&#39;ve seen also look cheezy.

Part of the value of the piece is in the fact that it&#39;s a Great Neck, so I wanted to leave this engraving visible.  In my drawer of oddball mouthpieces was blank that I&#39;m sure was a Conn Eagle C Melody.  Not common, but not too rare.  As a piece, it was a dud, but it did tune okay on a CMel.  What I noticed was the the shank ring looked just the right size for the Brilhart.

I&#39;ve posted pictures in the photo section of the procedure.  First, I knocked the ring off of the Conn.  No harm done (in fact, I opened up the CMel mouthpiece and sold it on Ebay minus the ring).  Next, I used a diamond needle file to cut a groove in the Brilhart shank.  The Brilhart has lines molded in the shank, so it was easy to put in the groove.  Then I sat the ring on the shank and tapped it into place with a resin mallet.  I think I&#39;ll put a drop of super glue on it just to make sure, but the ring snapped into place.  No more worries when I put this one on the neck.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just did the same banding on an alto Brilhart Tonalin Great Neck, leaving all of the shank printing visible.  As with the tenor, I used the band off of a Conn Eagle, this time an alto piece.  Unfortunately, the old Conn shank shattered when removing the band.  The band was then heated on a ceramic top stove to expand it.  I picked it up with wet leather gloves (so that I didn&#39;t put in on the mouthpiece when it was "sizzling" hot) and tapped using a resin mallet into the groove I had made on the shank.  Again I used a drop of superglue, although the fit was tight enough that I don&#39;t think it was necessary.  I added a photo in the banded Brilhart file.

I&#39;m putting an Otto Link 7* TENOR facing on the old Conn alto piece just for jollies.  I have no idea what that will be like.
