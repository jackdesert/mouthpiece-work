From Argentine country and by questions of best to intend the 
explanation of that thematic so specify, for those that be located
in countries of Spanish language, i think that will must possibility of 
correctly traslation. Because the system of automatic traslation not 
allowed even traslate correctly the manners, idiomatic expression, 
techniques expressions, etc., etc.,

For example: Terms as, sharp, flat, millimetre, inchs, etc., etc., 
generate promote confuse for the correct translate.

Will be very interesting that somebody supply some method of translate 
this terms correctly. Ex: Sharp = ........ or ..... (in Spanish), 
Gauge=....... or ...... (in Spanish), size or measurement too, because 
to talk in tenth of millimeter or inch are entirely different. In 
Argentina the principal system of measurement is the meter and 
millimeter; although the inch are used too, but in the car mechanics 
principally.

Later that, begin to explain again from the origin how to work on the 
mouthpieces correctly. 

The Spanish-speakers have mean contribute with ours experience relative 
to mouthpiece retouching.

Fraternally yours.
