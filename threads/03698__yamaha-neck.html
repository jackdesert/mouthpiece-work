You need to specify which horn you have. The YTS- 2X (21, 23, ect.) YTS-3X, 
YTS-5X, YTS-6X, and YTS-875 (Custom) have different neck sizes and styles 
due to differening bores and octave mechanisms.

My main tenor is a YTS-875 Custom made around 1994. It came with the stock 
M1 Yamaha neck and I tried a few other M1&#39;s and an F1 plated with different 
materials and what not. None of them seemed much different then what I 
already had. A few years later I ordered a Ponzol on the recommendation of a 
few folks on the "Sax on the Web" site and I like it a lot better then any 
of the Yamaha necks so that&#39;s what I use now.

Here&#39;s a link to the sax necks presently available from Yamaha.

Unison also makes necks which have gotten good reviews;

And if you have the money to spend the Glogers are reported to be excellent.
