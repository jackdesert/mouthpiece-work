No, actually the opposite, if the .0015" feeler is 44 and the .010" 
feeler is 34, you would want a longer facing.  So you might bring 
the .0015" feeler to 50 and the .010" feeler to 40 for better subtone.

.0015" = 50 and .010" = 40 is already a long facing.

You are correct.  But also, too small tip opening inhibits bending 
notes.  Larger tip openings make bending notes easier.

Thanks Paul,
so you are saying just a longer facing with the distance between the 
0.0015 and 0.010 kept at a distance of "10" on the glass (ex. 44-34, 
48-38 etc) would generally give you easyer subtones. It is true in 
most cases works that way; but I had tenor pieces with a 50 (25mm) 
facing length, where you&#39;d feel that it could do with even an easyer 
subtones production. Thats ofcourse in a case where the sax works at 
it&#39;s best, and also with the same reed but different piece you would 
actually get more and easyer subtones


I gues what I was also wondering is if anyone tryed to cut a curve 
where the 0.010 feeler comes to a distance bigger than 10 points on 
the glass gauge (5mm); 
.......or a smaller distance instead of keeping those 10 points( 5mm) 
between 0.0015 and 0.010 create a curve with just 4mm distance 
between them.
Thanks a lot,
Gabriel

            <pre class='message__body'>Quite by trial and error, I have found that the area behind the tip rail is the key to easy subtone.  

Try this: When you refaced, after you cut the curve you are left with a heavy tip rail. It is easy to scrape a nice tip rail with a reed knife or triangular scraper of file. Try to keep the baffle area behind the tip flat.  Spread this flatness to a good amount into the baffle. You don&#39;t want a rapid short rollover baffle. You need a good flat spot leading to a long baffle.  Test and adjust unitil you are happy. Clean it up with a fine riffler and fine sandpaper.

Look at some mouthpieces with easy response (and therefore subtone), Theo&#39;s Kali, Brilhart Levelaire, and DG original Brecker. All have a relatively flat area behind the tip.

I wonder what other have to say about this!

            <pre class='message__body'>I am not a big fan of roll-over baffles that are high near the tip rail.  They can make response sluggish like a wide tip rail does.  Jon Van Wie used to say that they block the sound from coming out.  Lowering them a little can make a mouthpiece "bloom" into a better mouthpiece.  Good subtones comes with better response.
 
But I also think this depends on a player&#39;s embouchure.  Those who like to take in a lot of mouthpiece can blow past most irregularities that annoy those who take in little or a medium amount of mouthpiece.  Some makers spend a lot of time trying to get their clients to take in more mouthpiece rather than make a better mouthpiece.

HI
Could you send me some pictures as examples of what you are talking about when you say "roll-over baffles that are high near the tip rail" and maybe a proper adjustment technique or a finished product of this kind of baffle adjustment?  That would be a great help for me.  THanks
