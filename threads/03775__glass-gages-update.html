  Late on the band wagon, but would you put me down for one "end zero" gauge please.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, 

If you&#39;re going to get them made yourself, I&#39;m interested.

I&#39;m using a narrow setback gauge all the time. I have a wide one with 
the zero flush with the edge which I only keep around as a backup.

Narrow with a setback appeals to me, though they&#39;re going to be my 
backups - I don&#39;t want to change gauges unless I&#39;m forced to through 
accidental damage.

I have a glass blank supplier and a etch/paint supplier lined up to 
make these.  If all goes well I should have gages to sell in about 5-6 
weeks.

I will be selling them initially at $12 each + s/h.  Later they will go 
for $15, still less than the Babbitt price of $20 + $7 s/h.  My s/h 
will be about 1/2 their rate. 

But there still is some risk until I get a finished sample produced.  
So stayed tuned.

            <pre class='message__body'>my company develops software for graphic arts.
I have a customer that can print on glass at euro 0,052 for glass (glass 
not included) + 30,00 euro for start up cost(film developing from file).

may be possible include each glass gauge type on a single "film" (to save 
on developing) and laser cutting each glasses after.
I dont have any idea about glasses and cutting costs.

I&#39;ll keep you advised.

Unfortunately, it did not go as well as I had hoped it would.  I 
have 6 samples etched here from 3 different companies.  Best of them 
is acceptable to me but the cost is higher than I had hoped.  The 
lines are slightly thicker than the Babbitt gages I have been 
using.  This is difficult for me to measure but it looks like .005"-
.008" vs .004"-.005" thick.  Since I just have one sample from 
the "best" etcher, there is a chance the lines will improve in 
thiness and consistency.  The individual lines do not waver in 
thickness but some at the bottom of the scale are thinner than the 
ones at the top.

On the minor plus side, the MOJO glass gages will have a more 
symmetric layout.  Babbitt is inconsistent with their horizontal 
line lengths and centering of them.

For another comparisone, the Morgan gage I have has brown painted 
lines on it that are .015" thick.

I&#39;ll most likely need to sell them initially at $18.50 + 3.50 s/h in 
the US.  International s/h will be $7.

I will not take any orders until I have the gages in hand.
