Could you pls describe how exactly you printed it (on transparency ?) and how you mounted on the glass.
Btw what is "plate" glass? (sorry not a native english speaker here).

            <pre class='message__body'>Plate glass is a bit thicker than normal window/slide glass.  I cut it to size, ground down the edges, and stuck the high-res printed transparency (transparent label) and covered it with a layer of clear tape.
