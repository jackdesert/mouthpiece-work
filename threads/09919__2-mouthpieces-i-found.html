            <pre class='message__body'>HI All,

I came across 2 mouthpieces that I had from the early 60&#39;s. One is a Selmer D for a contrabass (I think) clarinet) the other is a baritone sax mouthpiece.

I&#39;m interested in finding out more about these. I looked at Selmer&#39;s site and saw that if this Selmer D is a contrabass mouthpiece it is worth some money. If it is I&#39;ll sell it and use the money to buy another mouthpiece for either my Soprano or Alto Sax.

The baritone mouthpiece (at least it looks like a bari mouthpiece) has no name on it. There is a picture of an Eagle engraved on it and the words Trade Mark. Like the one above If it is worth it I will sell it for more musical supplies. It never ends :)

BTW does anyone here have a reedual? I have one but have not used it so much because of lack of time to learn how to use it. I&#39;m disabled and between doctors, hositals and some volunteer work for rape victims. Thus leaving little time for what I really Love.

Thanks,

Steve
