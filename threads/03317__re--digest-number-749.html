I&#39;m sure this is the case but why? It seems with as many of us looking to 
have a few of these around that we should be able to get some. You&#39;d think 
they were made out of Unobtainium or something, jeez. Couldn&#39;t we find out 
where they come from, get together like we have in the past for other stuff, 
and put in an order for 200 pieces then split them up (5-10 a piece ) 
between us??? Even if they charge us $3 a piece it would be worth $15 to 
have them around.


Just wondering,

Keith

            <pre class='message__body'>Bite plates for currently manufactured mouthpieces are available from 
the manufacturers, no problem.

Where do they come from?  The bottoms of drawers and boxes in dust 
covered shelves of old music stores.  New ones are not produced.

But biteplates for the Brilhart Levelaires, which have been out of 
production since, I think, the early 70&#39;s are difficult to obtain.  
Brilhart sold out to Selmer, but who knows what happened to the dies to 
mold the old biteplates?  To make new dies would be very expensive, on 
the order of $10,000 or so.  The cost for such a low number would be 
prohibitive.

The manufacturers, if still around, are not interested in making parts 
for long out of date products.  Selmer, for example, does not want to 
supply parts for Mark VI&#39;s.  They want to sell you a new Selmer product.

$3 each?  We could not have news ones made for $30 each.

            <pre class='message__body'>I can get them via eMachineShop for about $20 each for 25.  This is 
for clear acrylic.  They do not list black but it may be available.  
For 200, I can get the price below $8.  But only if you pay me up 
front.  They would still require some hand shaping to fit.

Its annoying when you need one, but I dont think there is this much 
demand for them.  I would just rather make them one at a time as 
needed.
