            <pre class='message__body'>Paul has graciously retyped the three Runyon articles from the 
1960&#39;s "On Clarinet Mouthpieces".  They were missing some words and 
were tough to read.  They, and the original scans, are in 
the "Files", "Clarinet" section on the MPworks site.

The title is misleading.  I think the info discussed pertains more to 
sax mouthpieces.  You can see Runyon&#39;s high baffle ideas emerging.

            <pre class='message__body'>There is an 8/2/02 revision by Paul that has the correct missing 
words.  See the Files/Clarinet section.
