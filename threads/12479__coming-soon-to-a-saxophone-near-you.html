> We make every possible effort to listen to you in order to provide products which make playing your saxophone easier and more enjoyable. Players told us that they needed a mouthpiece which enabled them to play and be heard with amplified instruments without being hard to blow, harsh in tone, or excessively bright and thin sounding. After a great deal of experimenting, we are pleased to be able to offer you the Saxgourmet Super Duck Delrin. This Made in USA mouthpiece combines the very latest in polymer technology with precision manufacturing using CNC technology. There is simply nothing remotely like it, anywhere, at any price! As always, when better saxophone products nare needed, Saxgourmet will bring them to you. Please fell free to call me with your questions. Remember, this is the only place you can actually talk with the designer!

Very good question. 

I&#39;ll be interested in Steve&#39;s response; but
one possibility is the presence of "plastic memory" in the finished
product due to stresses in long chain polymers comprising the mouthpiece
material. The degree of accuracy you mention applies to metal items, but
may not be attainable in machined thermplastic items 

Considering
thermoplastic items in general, that are molded out of shredded former
items, small beads, or even powder, the smaller pieces retain a "memory"
of their shape, resulting in internal stresses. Machining exposes such
stresses , for example at a tip rail. The result could be slight
warping. Play testing and touch up could be necessary, even in Delrin,
which is claimed to have "excellent dimensional stability."

            <pre class='message__body'>it’s true that using CNC technology does allow the manufacture of mouthpieces which come off the machine FAR more accurate and are produced quicker……that being said, remember that the machines don’t program themselves, and that the initial set up is a considerable expense. Also, and very importantly, we have yet to find anyone giving away CNC machines, which are incredibly expensive.

We’ve been doing a good bit of research on 3D printing, and after a couple of years and a lot of different attempts and several generations of machines can now accurately print mouthpieces.

 Unfortunately, although you can print a copy of any mouthpiece you can scan, the economics are currently just not there. The process simply takes too long.

The CNC off brand mouthpieces are high quality and often reasonably inexpensive. Once the tech process gets worked out for the more complex woodwind mouthpieces, it is the design and last little bit of QC and hand tweaking that will set the good apart from the great. There should be better intermediate mouthpieces for much less, soon.
