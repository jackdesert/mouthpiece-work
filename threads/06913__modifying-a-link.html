Steve, I do similar work on Links, but go a step further and also fill in the sidewalls so that they are flat, too.

The result is a focused tone, faster response, and a brigher tone without being harsh.

I think I get much better results this way than from the step baffles a lot of us have been putting in Links for a long time.  It&#39;s a lot more of a job, though.  
Obviously it&#39;s not groundbreaking work -- I&#39;m not the first and can&#39;t be the only one doing Links like this.  Ultimately the results (as with anything we do) are all in the quality of the craftmanship.
