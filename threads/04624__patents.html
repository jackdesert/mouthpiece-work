            <pre class='message__body'>There are many mouthpiece patents.  The newer one usually reference older
ones by name and number.  Check the Links - Patent area of the Yahoo MPWork
site.  I have some links there to a few patents.  They may not all work but
you can get an idea of where they are and how to search for them.
