            <pre class='message__body'>Dear,

Sorry my English!

I&#39;m new on this forum, and especially in the matter of Mouthpiece Work.

I searched the menu files I wonder if there is any information about the names of the parts, concepts of a mouthpiece.

It was interesting if there were any photo, picture (drawing) with the name of all parts of the mouthpiece, stating: open tip, tip rail, radius, start, facing radial fit, avg L, L, R, anyway. These data appear in the excel spreadsheet facing curve.

Thanks dear for me to accept this prestigious group discussion.

Ricardo
