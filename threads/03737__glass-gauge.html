            <pre class='message__body'>I have already contacted Babbitt and got a reply.  But I have not placed an
order yet so I can still accept a few more.

Babbitt says they are willing to process this group order "this one time". 
They do not have the number we need in stock.  It will be several weeks
before delivery.

I have decided to take a few days to see if I can find someone who will
make the guages for us.  The quantity is high enough that I think it can be
economical to not go through Babbitt.  But I have not burned any bridges
yet.

if you find someone who will make the gauges which are qualitative

Re plexi or acrylic, a piece chosen for this use should be tested for
flatness; may look flat, but may not be. And it may not stay flat. "Plastic
memory" (internal stresses among the polymerized molecules) may alter the
shape of plastic over time, except for special plastics that are specially
made for precision work.

I sold out of glass gages a while back.  I do not plan on getting more.  I
barely broke even and donated a lot of time to the effort.

I do still have metal reed sets for use as templates to shape the tip curve
and the table/side rail width.
