            <pre class='message__body'>HR 5M 0,0015 - 44
 0,010 - 32
 0,024 - 22
 0,034 - 14
 0,050 - 10
 Tip - Would say about 75. My digital is broken so it is hard to be precise.
 

 I also have Jet 5, 7. DV7 and HR 7m if you are interested. The rest I´ve loaned out but I can get my hands on them in a week or so

            <pre class='message__body'>Is it a tenor mouthpiece discussed here?  There&#39;s no listing for a 5M on 
the chart on jodyjazz.com. He shows a C* at .080" and a 5* at .085"

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>Wow! 
 

 Thanks
 

 It's ok..I have their tip opening chart

 

How about for the .002 feeler?  

 I use a different set of feelers. Started at .002

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry, only got 0,0015 feelers. Hard to get my hands on a .002. All the bike/car shops got MM setup and they never have anything similar to a .002..  

 But if I dont remember completely wrong I think there is a discussion on how to adjust these numbers in Excel or maybe someone even made a file for it

            <pre class='message__body'>Got the post 

 

 difference between .0015 and .002 feeler is just 1.
 

 If it's 44 on .0015 it's 43 on .002
 

 whew!!!
 

 Can I also ask for the other readings that you have on Jody?
