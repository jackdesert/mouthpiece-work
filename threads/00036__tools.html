Can any of the smaller, more hobby size lathes be of any use to us

rather than high production rate for metal.

           You betchum, Red Ryder!  Bring on the epoxy putty! 
          One thing I have done, to experiment, was to drip candle wax into the chamber.  Then carve this to shape.  It is more stable than chewing gum... Hah!  Then experiment with shapes, contours.  If I went too far, a few more drips of wax.  When I had a likely good shape (or not) I would just chip out the wax and start again with epoxy putty.

               Certainly right on the mark, Phil!  That is why I suggested we do as is suggested by John Winslow, and use some student model pieces, inexpensive, yet good players to start with.  Then experiment to find our for ourselves what change has what effect.  Constant working and playing is the only way to learn this. 
              I turned a lot of good mouthpieces into junk before I started to get some results.  But this was working in a vacuum... no internet help 30 years ago.

            <pre class='message__body'>Paul, one of the mistakes I made was getting into the mouthpiece thing too much.  I wish I had stuck to playing instead and left the mouthpiece making to the pros.  If you&#39;re willing to let your playing slide then go for it.  you can&#39;t be obsessed with two things at the same time. Phil

       Moooore Power!!!!!   Yes! 
      Can any of the smaller, more hobby size lathes be of any use to us duffers?  At least, if working in other materials, such as delrin, rather than high production rate for metal.

           Removing material... Well, once removed it is gone... I have made tools from dowels, with sandpaper glued on, have a number of files of different shapes.  Some great tools for this at www.micromark.com. 
          What do you use?

               You betchum, Red Ryder!  Bring on the epoxy putty! 
              One thing I have done, to experiment, was to drip candle wax into the chamber.  Then carve this to shape.  It is more stable than chewing gum... Hah!  Then experiment with shapes, contours.  If I went too far, a few more drips of wax.  When I had a likely good shape (or not) I would just chip out the wax and start again with epoxy putty.

                Paul, something we overlook also is that the chamber reigns king over the facing when it comes to importance in changing the sound.  Facings are a good start but knowing your chamber work is what seperates the men from the boys. Phil                    For all your mouthpiece needs

                   Certainly right on the mark, Phil!  That is why I suggested we do as is suggested by John Winslow, and use some student model pieces, inexpensive, yet good players to start with.  Then experiment to find our for ourselves what change has what effect.  Constant working and playing is the only way to learn this. 
                  I turned a lot of good mouthpieces into junk before I started to get some results.  But this was working in a vacuum... no internet help 30 years ago.

The elusive spreadsheet problem was resolved by right clicking the 
file, and using the "save as" option....(Came down in seconds)


Payback.....? To relieve the baffle close to the tip rail, I fitted a 
drafting compass with a home made, flat ended blade.

By trial and error, on paper, I found the outside tip radius,
and with the compas set to that radius, dimpled the baffle with the 
compas point.
By reducing the compas radius by the tip rail width, I was easily 
able to scrape away the interior baffle, with little worry of a slip.

Hope that helps someone, this site has helped me.
Thanks.
Ross

            <pre class='message__body'>I find vices and clamps just get in the way.  A mouthpiece needs to be
repositioned so many times while reworking it.  One hand holds it, the
other shapes.

Sometimes I will set a mouthpiece onto a gob of bluetack while working on
the chamber and baffle. I&#39;m still holding onto it, but the bluetack keeps it
from sliding around, makes it easier to hold it firmly in one position.

When measuring the facing curve, I find it helpful to strap the mouthpiece
onto the gauge using a modified Rovner ligature - see the photo in the photo
files.

I use a hobbyist&#39;s vice with rubber faced clamps.  It has an
adjustable ball and socket joint on the base and can be mounted on the
edge of a desk.  It can be set at virtually any angle.  I use it to
hold the mouthpiece with the facing side up so that I can work on the
chamber, tip or facing curve.  Mouthpiece is held rock steady and both
hands are free for holding tools, etc.

Sounds like everyone has their own method that works for them . . .

            <pre class='message__body'>Most (all) of the mouthpiece refacers that I know of (myself included)
hold them in their hands while they work. Especially while working on
the facing. I suppose if you were using a dremel to work on the
chamber then you might want to have the MP held steady in some kind of
vise, but otherwise, I find it necessary to hold it in my hand.

            <pre class='message__body'>Barry,

Those are both GREAT ideas. I&#39;ve tried various methods of holding the
mthpc onto the glass gauge, but none have been satisfactory. The
Rovner lig sounds like a great idea, though. I&#39;m gonna try it.

I tried holding the glass gage on with a Rovner lig once.  My readings were
significantly different.  I did not play with it long enough to figure out
exactly why.
