 hello all!  i have a hard rubber mouthpiece for soprano sax. that i love to death. and thru much time i have begun to wear a tooth groove in it .. my question!  is there some kind of substance  i can use to fill in the groove that will harden.that i can smooth down to preserve the life of this mouthpiece. i never use those teeth pads. dont like em!
 
 i was thinking something i could put in the groove that would stick to hard rubber. that i could sand the top of to make it even.. as time goes by no matter how you try to avoid it your tooth naturaly ends up in the crack.thus speeding the process. soon there will be a hole. i want to stop this process and preserve my favorite  mouthpiece.
 
 thanks for your input donn

The top few notes of the alto sax, E, F, F# require the oral cavity to be altered as if playing altissimo.  This is not necessary on tenor, and was one of the problems I had years ago playing alto.
 
For the "forked" high E and F, as well as F# to work correctly adjust the front F aka fork F aka auxillary F key to open the F palm key pad only about 1 - 2 mm&#39;s, just a crack.  That is why it is adjustable on most saxes.
 
Also for F#, you can use the fork high F fingering and add the right hand index finger (F). 
 
or use the fork high F and add the side Bb
 
or use the fork high F and add the high F# key (this works on tenor, too)
 
All three of these will work on alto and soprano.
 
Tenor requires to produce an F# using the fork high F fingering and adding both the right hand index finger (F) AND side Bb.

I can doit myself with some oral cavity adjustment but it&#39;s stillunpredictable if it will come out. The same goes if I use the Aux Fwith side Bflat fingering.She&#39;s using a Morgan 4M mouthpiece. It&#39;s slightly easier with a Morgan5M or with an SR legend, but still not as good as I would want it to be.I have a Borgani tenor which is again excellent except that the topF#, though easy enough to produce, but is somewhat weak. Is there a way of fixing this on the alto?Link to Paul&#39;s articles from Main page of "Saxgourmet":http://www.saxgourmet.comListen to Paul&#39;s MP3&#39;s and view saxophone photos at:http://briefcase.yahoo.com/tenorman1952Paul Coats is the sole US importer of SAXRAX products from http://www.saxrax.com For SAXRAX products, email Paul at saxraxus@...

            <pre class='message__body'>Epoxies can be used if you are willing to use at least a thin clear patch
over it.  I would use 810 2-part acrylic made by 3M.  It can be purchased
in a small cartridge from McMaster-Carr.  However, it is intended to go in
a special gun to dispense it.  I made up a wood 2-dowel plunger to push it
out.
