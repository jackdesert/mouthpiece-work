            <pre class='message__body'>Good day refacers
 

 

 Will the piece that has a facing length is 50mm and a tip opening of .064 work? 
 

 I noticed that mouthpieces with long facing has a tip opening of .070 above. 
 

 I refaced a stock mouthpiece that has a bump on the table and a crooked facing length so what i did was flatten the table first and remeasured the facing curve. I found out that even though the table was already flat, the facing length is really crooked with a length of 44 on the left side and 50 on the right side. 
 

 With that I decided to reach the 50 in order for it to equal.
 

 Is there a possibility to decrease the 50 to 44 or the 50 should reached in order for it both sides to be equal? 
 

 

 May I know your thoughts and or solutions for this case? 
 

 Thank you

You flip a piece of whatever sandpaper you are using over, and put the too close facing side on the sandpaper side and the more open side on the flipped sandpaper side and work slowly, measuring each time until they match.

 That's what I did actually
 

 

 Is my logic accurate that if the left is 44 and the right is 50, the side that I will sand is the left side and reach it until 50 so that both sides will be equal? 
 

 

 Can 50 be reduced to 44 or lesser?

50 can be reduced to 44 by flattening the table.  But the left side will get shorter than 44 unless you tilt the table.   The idea is to take more off the table on the 50 side and little to nothing from the 44 side.

            <pre class='message__body'>The longest facing length I know on a mouthpiece approaching that tip opening is actually a smaller tip opening but is advertised as 24mm, and that is the Selmer Concept. So 48, but that also means you wouldn&#39;t measure that on your gauge. If it is even with a nice facing curve and you like how it plays, then you have your answer.

            <pre class='message__body'>>> Can 50 be reduced to 44 or lesser? 

Yes taking down one side of the table by putting more pressure on the side that is too long. It may have arrived at the crooked results by leaning on one side more that the other.

Yes

 

 

That&#39;s what I did actually

 

 

Is my logic accurate that if the left is 44 and the right is 50, the side that I will sand is the left side and reach it until 50 so that both sides will be equal? 

 

 

Can 50 be reduced to 44 or lesser? 

 

 

Thank you
