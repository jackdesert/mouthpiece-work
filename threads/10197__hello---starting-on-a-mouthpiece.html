            <pre class='message__body'>Been playing sax a while....Just purchased a C-Melody from Aquilasax and it seems to be nicely made. The mouthpiece that I ordered with it doesn&#39;t do quite to my liking and I&#39;ve ordered a different one - but in the mean time I&#39;m going to see if I can make one... I&#39;ll machine it from brass - anyhow I have posted some images in "ClemCMelody" of the 1st attempt.....(may sound like a kazoo but it&#39;s a start!)

            <pre class='message__body'>Welcome. Looks like you know your way around a CAD program.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, that rendering took some &#39;English&#39; to accomplish! It is still not exactly what I want - but a starting point anyhow.... I left some of the features sort-of &#39;fat&#39; or &#39;full&#39; in order to machine a somewhat semi finished part. I&#39;m studying the files here to sort out in my mind what I really want. These mouthpieces are not so easily understood! Thanks!
