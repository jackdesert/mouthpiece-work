Hi everyone,
I have got a simple doubt. This might seem very obvious for those with a wide experience. If I want to make one side rail thinner I need to do it from the respective chamber side, isn´t it?
And if I want to make the tip rail thinner I need to reface the baffle, isn´t it? 
Thank you,
Fran 		 	   		  </pre>

If you want to make a side rail thinner, you should first center a reed on the mouthpiece.  Look to see if the reed is wider than the ouside edge of the rails.  If the rails are wider than the reed, you should thin the side rails from the outside.  Otherwise, you can thin from the inside.  

A tip rail can be thinned from the inside or outside.  If the tip end is pointed sharp (say from opening the tip), it is better to thin it some from the outside.
