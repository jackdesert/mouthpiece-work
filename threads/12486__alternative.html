 I have seen many tip gauge that are digital and manual. I can't find any tip gauge here in our place (Philippines). I tried to look in the web and found out that it is expensive

            <pre class='message__body'>The eBay depth gauge does look good.   I asked the seller the question:

Can the 4" base be mounted offset so one side is ~3" long and the other ~1" long? It looks like it may be possible in the photos.

They said "Yes".  I use a non-digital depth gauge with a 6" long base.  But only 3" is needed on one side of the probe.

http://www.dx.com/p/zndiy-bry-z-096-1-7-screen-digital-indicators-0-25-4mm-0-001mm-277886

...and attached it to a solid steel bench block with plastic epoxy. Then I put painter's tape so mouthpieces don't get scratches.

If you want one like Theo's but cheaper, with the very dial indicator I got, there is a company in Italy who makes it. I think it was 100â‚¬, 120 tops.

They seem to be under construction at the moment. Here is the web site.

By the way, I don't like the one on eBay because you probably wouldn't see the tip rail well to be able to put it right where you want it. I rather have the tip on the edge of the base.

Let us know what you end up getting!

            <pre class='message__body'>There is a photo album on the Yahoo group site that shows several tip measuring gauges.  One of them is the machinist&#39;s depth gauge I use that has a 6" base.  I can see the tip rail fine when using it.   But I still probe around a little to convince myself what the reading should be.  Tip measuring takes a bit of "art" to get a good reading.  More "art" than a gauge reading should need.   

I find the spring loaded plunger can give you a false large reading when measuring softer plastic mouthpieces.  Delrin Quantums are tricky to measure.  You need to hold back the plunger and kiss it up to the tip rail.   With a machinist&#39;s gauge, there is no spring loaded plunger.
