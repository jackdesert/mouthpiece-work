Subject: [MouthpieceWork] facing lengths? Re: Clarinet Mouthpiece
Recommendations

Bootman,

Can you provide the specs for the facing curve? Or at least, the 
facing length and tip opening?

For that matter, can anyone else provide a "range" of facing lengths 
for clarinet, similar to what Paul provided a few weeks ago? (for 
alto and tenor). What is a typical medium facing length for clarinet?

I&#39;ve recently picked up the clarinet again - (the bandleader of the 
Fantasy Big Band here in Milford, mass insists on acquiring charts 
that call for clarinet doubles! :-), and with my newly-acquired 
interest in mouthpiece facing work, I&#39;m curious about the mouthpieces 
I&#39;m using, and what a typical facing lenght is.

Thanks all,
Peter
