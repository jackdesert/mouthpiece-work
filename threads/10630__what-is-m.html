            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Friends,
I am the "new boy" in this group. I am writting from Spain and as you
see, my english is not  very good. But, I promise I will learn...
For that, I found a problem with some words and I would like to ask to
you what is the mean the letter M at the Spreadsheet. Reading some 
mouthpiece facing curve I find and really, I don´t know what is this.
Anybody could help me?
Also, I am using Excel 2010 and I can´t find Solver component to use.
I know this is not the good place to ask, but maybe.... (help me!)
My best regards, and again Sorry for this.
Sergio

            <pre class='message__body'>I created this spreadsheet (years ago).  M looks like the distance from the tip in mm*2 where the radial curve meets the flat table at a tangent.  It is a mathematical facing length that is longer than the commonly accepted facing length measured to the .0015" feeler.  M would be measured to the .0000" feeler if it existed.
 
The Solver function often needs to be installed via the Tools Add-ins menu.  I&#39;m not sure about the 2010 Excel version.
