            <pre class='message__body'>Hello members:

I need the ideal lay schedule or curve for this excellent early brass 
Dukoff TENOR Super Power Chamber.  It is an original D4 that 
measures .088" at the tip and I want to open it to .100 or D7. Please 
specify Winslow or Brand feelers. Any other tips concerning baffle 
shaping or suggestions for optimal tone quality or response would be 
appreciated.

No, it&#39;s not for sale. 

Thanks, Greg

            <pre class='message__body'>You can use a facing curve in the Files - Tenor Sax area.  You will 
need MS Excel or a compatible program.  There is a spreadsheet labled 
Tenor Link Facing Curve Table.  Use the column for a Link 7 = .100".   
Just plug in your own set of feelers in the far left column.  The 
glass gage numbers will update automatically.

I might be inclined to go a little longer with the facing length than 
46.  But the one there aint bad.
