            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: VD Clarinet piece and Chirping</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Vandoren B40 clarinet piece and it chirps a lot when I do fast
articulation exercises.  I have tried different brands of reeds and I
find that they all have a chirp to some extent.  I went tried out
several new B40s and other VDs, but they all seem to have a chirp to
some extent when I play.
The strange thing is that I never have this problem with any
mouthpiece except Vandoren.  All MY pieces (blanks from Babitt) have
no problems.
Does this have something to do with the grainy texture of the facing???
And more generally, what causes chirps in clarinet mouthpieces??
Thanks for the help in advance...

            <pre class='message__body'>Gosh S G, I sure don&#39;t know, haven&#39;t had that problem, just others. For  most 
of the VD mps that I have had, and some students-repair types, I almost  
always "polish" the table & lay on newspaper, and some with marks/small  chips, I 
reface [lightly] on 600+ SiC paper and polish for [usually] improvement  !!  
You might try that, but prob. not yet on your best mps !!  Luck,  Don

            <pre class='message__body'>"What causes chirping in clarinet mouthpieces?"
   
  My fat fingers blipping the little tiny chromatic keys and not sealing the holes well.
   
  I can fix that by use of a plateau key clarinet with the chromatic Eb/Bb and A#/F# corked down.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, a light once over with 600 or 800 paper, then turn the paper back side up and make several more passes.  There is just enough silicon carbide dust on the back side to put a fine polish on the mouthpiece, whether hard rubber, plastic, or even metal.
