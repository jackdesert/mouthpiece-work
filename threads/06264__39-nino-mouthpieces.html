            <pre class='message__body'>  I&#39;m about to add a sopranino mouthpiece to my product offerings.
 I have very few &#39;nino pieces in my personal collection, and access to
 examples is pretty limited. Any specs such as tip openings or facing 
information would be much appreciated. We&#39;ve come up with a pretty 
good blank but I really am unsure as to market expectations.

With regard to the sopranino&#39;s reputation for intonation problems, I 
think it is pretty safe to say *that* would be at the top of most 
players&#39; lists.  Considering the small pool of sopranino players, a 
piece versatile enough to be used with both the Selmer and 
Yanagisawa designs (and current Chinese copies of, for that matter) 
should be the most marketable, should that be a realistic or 
obtainable goal.  

As you say, you have chosen a blank, but regardless of facing 
options, stability and intonation between octaves is the primary 
concern for me.  So, ideally, more than anything, I would like to 
see a mouthpiece that would help diminish the acoustical issues and 
tendancies of the instrument itself.  I realize only so much can be 
done this way, but as we all know, a suitable mouthpiece on a 
soprano accomplishes a lot.  That is what I am looking for in a 
sopranino mouthpiece.  As you also mention, the options that are 
currently out there are few, hence my search.  Hope this helps!

            <pre class='message__body'>I was able to round up various tip openings after a bit of research. I&#39;ve
got five different sopranino mouthpieces so I was able to compare curves and
facing lengths. The company that makes my mouthpiece blanks for me sent some
blanks to experiment on, and I&#39;ve found a set of numbers that work quite
well. Of course, I also learned a lot about what does not work, but that&#39;s
the nature of design.
