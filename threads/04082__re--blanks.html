            <pre class='message__body'>> I would like to know if anyone has a good sorce for blanks and how much they
cost?

I&#39;ve used Rico Royal Graftonite mouthpieces as blanks for experimenting,
they run about $17-18 at wwbw.com.

They are some kind of extremely tough plastic material, and come in a range
of facings and chamber sizes.

Compared to most mouthpieces, their baffle slopes away from the tip rail
rather sharply at first.

I use re-worked Rico Graftonites on clarinet. They were designed by
Arnold Brilhart and are of an extremely hard graphite/plastic mix.
This makes them very difficult to work on, especially flatening the table.
I found that the lays were much longer than specified, though the tips
were fairly accurate. For that reason, I buy the closer #3 just to get
the shorter lay and cut down on the table work.The chambers need a
little work because they are machine moulded. About 17GBP in U.K.
Excellent for Jazz.   Eddie
