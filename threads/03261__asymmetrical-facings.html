Hello all,

Are there any proponents of asymmetrical facings (I&#39;m primarily 
interested in clarinets) in this chat group?  I&#39;ve never learned 
anything about them, other than that they provide resistance.  I&#39;ve 
also not experimented with them, as they just don&#39;t make sense to me.  
Also, why fix what isn&#39;t broken, as they say.  So, in my mind and in 
all of my learning, I have heard only negative things about them, but 
would love to hear some positive things about them.  There are many 
great players that do play asymmetrical facings, so perhaps there are 
some considerations that I have not thought about.  Thanks a lot!

I went to a Ron Caravan mouthpiece/reed lecture a few years ago and he
mentioned one thing about asymmetrical facings.  He said that when he
was starting out he went around to many professors (sax and clarinet)
and measured their mouthpieces and he found that nearly all of them
had an asymmetrical facing.
Is there anyone here that has done experimentation with asymmetrical
facings???

Asymmetrical meaning what? There are a multitude of ways for a facing
to be asymmetrical and only one way for it to be symmetrical. If we
are talking about a flat spot on the curve of the rails there has been
discussion of this being of value in clarinet facings. I have yet to
hear anyone advocate any asymmetry in the height of the rails or the
table in general. This would be useful, I think, only to compensate
for asymmetry in the scrape of the reed, and of course it is much
better to adjust the reed for the mpc than the mpc for the reed...

            <pre class='message__body'>Yea Paul,
  I agree with you. If the mouthpiece is not even across the raill, the reeds will leak.Unfortunately in the old days and even now depending on the Quality controll coming from the factorys or shop mothpieces are crooked.I always take my tools to a music store when I am checking out pieces.Guys would be surprised at even the real expensive stuff coming out bad,

I agree with this.  A refacer (and client) takes a risk in "fixing" the
defects he sees.  The irregularities usually add some resistance to the MP
in a unique way.  

Sometimes a player is so used to compensating for irregularities that they
do not appreciate a well faced mouthpiece.

  I have always found that evening a mouthpiece up works for the craftsman and the player, just as long as you can figure out which way he,the player needs to go.Shorter ,or longer.I have a guy who likes a certain stylle piece and came to me with some idiosyncracys that I straightend up.When I finished remaking the 1st facing it played great for me, but way to easy for him.After I figured out what he likes I changed my approach and did another 5 pieces for him.He loves them.I don&#39;t beleive in crooked mouthpieces.I have had one on alto, and one on clarinet at different.These played ok,but were monodimensional in what I could do with them.Instead of me playing them , I guess you can say they played me.

 problem is i dont have a very good leak light right now. my primary one fell apart.(wont say where i purchased it from) 
 
 i had a problem before with the same key on my soprano. i was starting to think i lost my ability to play. until i detected that pinhole.

Check your neck to see if your octave key is closing all the way.Double check your palm keys, and double check you side Bb and C.Some times it doesn&#39;t look like it is leaking, but it is just enough to throw you a curve.If you don&#39;t see antthing you might heat each one of those keys I just talked about one at a time and playcheck after each key has been heated.If that doesn&#39;t get it look at your F# and Eb.Good luck.Mikole Kaar

  It is quite common for hard rubber mouthpieces to warp over the years, or for them to not be symmetrical in the first place.
   
  Some say an assymetrical facing gives "more complex overtones".  But I have found what it does is make it more difficult to find a reed that will vibrate correctly.

 not to mention that leak was sabotaging my altissimo range.. why it appeared out of nowhere is one of those myteries we live with. no!
 
 i now have a new project. i think i can handle the leak light idea. i guess a long skinny floresent tube  would  work well..it shouldnt be to hard to set up. not sure if i can get it to work well with the soprano. though i can insert it thru the bell.
 
 thanks again.. i live in costa rica right now so sometimes the more sophiticated and modern equipment is hard to find.. though this one should work. i had been searching for other ideas for a good leak light. and its been troublesome. the floresent light i know i can obtain...  thanks again pura vida!

   in the capital city san jose. there is a bit of a jazz scene there are 1 or 2 exelent places to gig or catch a gig. sometimes they have some top people come through, all in all though it is limited. you can always hook up with a salsa or merengue band and jazz it up , a lot of times they have good brass sections. in the tourist areas there are usually places that have various entertainment. on various nights. i kind of gig at different times with different people. do a lot of solo work. right now i am somewhat removed from the city. the benifit it is more beautiful and not congested ect. the downside not as much opportunity to play with sections and groups. though i stay busy.. and i can always woodshed my self to death if nothing else..
 
 it is a beautiful country.. but nowhere as near as musical as say mexico!  pura vida donn

            <pre class='message__body'>This thread kind of reminds me of the old Moms Mabley joke.  She was 
always on stage without her dentures.  She said she had some new ones 
made, but they hurt so bad she was trying to get her money back.  The 
dentist wouldn&#39;t do it.  He said that there was nothing wrong with them 
and they fit him just fine.

If you&#39;re making a piece for somebody else, how do you know which part 
to make asymetrical?

  There was actually a section in the old Eric Brand manual about this.  If a customer had a mouthpiece that he really liked the way it played, you measured and kept a record of his facing, and could duplicate that on other mouthpieces.
