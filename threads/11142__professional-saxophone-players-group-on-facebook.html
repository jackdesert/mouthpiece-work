            <pre class='message__body'>We&#39;ve got a VERY active group devoted to strictly professional players issues…..1,075 members as of 5:00PM today…..it&#39;s moderated, and anybody posting off topic is immediately expelled…..unlike another "pro players" group on Facebook, it&#39;s not a bunch of guys telling each other how great they are and about their big gig once a month at some restaurant…..the discussion is limited to how to make a living playing and things that come up in real working musicians lives….please accept my invitation to join…..here&#39;s a link:

http://www.facebook.com/groups/499505313429474/

stop by, read the posts, decide if it&#39;s for you…..if you take money for playing, it probably is…….

The group title, if you want to do a search, is PROFESSIONAL SAXOPHONE PLAYERS…..we also maintain some other Facebook groups: Saxophones and Saxophone Equipment for Sale; Saxophone Repair; Saxophone Mouthpieces; Vintage and Collector Saxophones…..you&#39;re invited to join and participate in them all…..they&#39;re all very active</pre>
