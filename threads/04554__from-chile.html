Dear all, 

I&#39;ve been trying to learn more about repairing mouthpieces. 5 years ago I started working on the mouthpiece modification without a teacher or any information and let me tell you that I lost a few MP before get a good job same thing happened with saxes. I really appreciate all de information that you can send me ´cause here&#39;s no body to teach about this job. I love Sax, MP´s  and work on it but I don&#39;t have many information. I learned from a Cuban Luthier some things but I feel that I need more.

I loose my glass gage last year an the feeler gauge so I really need to buy, does any one knows where can I get them? If any one knows about more tools please let tell me.

Regards

            <pre class='message__body'>Welcome Ricardo,

Take some time to look through the information posted at the Yahoo 
MouthpieceWork site.   The greeting on the Home page says where you 
can find a list of basic gages for purchase.

There are also summary files with suggestions on what steps to take to 
learn this craft.
