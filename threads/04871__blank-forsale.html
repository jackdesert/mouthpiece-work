            <pre class='message__body'>Brass itself is not toxic, but many brasses are alloyed with lead to make them easier to machine (usually around 1% IIRC, but up to 8%), and this lead can leach out--obviously not a good thing. I believe that the bad taste comes from oxidation, but the mpcs themselves will not deteriorate quickly--witness the many brass plumbing fixtures in use (which should be made from non-leaded brass).

I answered this somewhat back on 2/7/07.

You can also consider a Guardala Laser Trimmed Studio.  SR Tech and a 
few others offer similar designs.  A Vandoren Jumbo Java too.  Bigger 
exterior but a similar interior design.
