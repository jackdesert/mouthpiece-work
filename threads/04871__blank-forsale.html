These were designed by me and machined by eMachineShop (not casted).  There
are pictures on the Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site and threads of old
discussions.  You can not get these new for $20 any more.

            <pre class='message__body'>Could a blank metal mouthpiece be crafted into the same measurements as a Dukoff? Wouldn&#39;t the barrel shape and other things on the blank need to be the same as the Dukoff?
  I would like to have a Dukoff moutpiece made of a better material....
  Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Brass itself is not toxic, but many brasses are alloyed with lead to make them easier to machine (usually around 1% IIRC, but up to 8%), and this lead can leach out--obviously not a good thing. I believe that the bad taste comes from oxidation, but the mpcs themselves will not deteriorate quickly--witness the many brass plumbing fixtures in use (which should be made from non-leaded brass).

I answered this somewhat back on 2/7/07.

You can also consider a Guardala Laser Trimmed Studio.  SR Tech and a 
few others offer similar designs.  A Vandoren Jumbo Java too.  Bigger 
exterior but a similar interior design.
