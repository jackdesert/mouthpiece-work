            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know if this is a local problem with my Email or a Yahoo 
problem, but lately the MouthpieceWork posts are arriving at my 
mailbox 12-26 hours after they were posted.  If you want to see the 
most current questions and replies, you will need to visit the group 
site.

In case you did not know, you can set up you membership to mail out 
individual posts, a daily digest, or have no posts Emailed to you.

You can also probably set up your own Email software to route the 
Emails as they come in.  With web-based Yahoo Email, this feature is 
called a "filter".  I have a filter set up to route posts 
from "kwbradbury" and "Keith Bradbury" to the Trash folder.  I do not 
need to reread my own posts.  I then have a third filter to route 
Emails with "MouthpieceWork" in their subject title to 
my "MouthpieceWork" folder.  This was working real well for me until 
recently.  Now it seems like old news.
