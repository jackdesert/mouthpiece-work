            <pre class='message__body'>Hello everyone,

I am relatively new in the mouthpiece refacing world...and just wanted everyone to know that 
all your posts and files/pictures has really helped me get started.

Anyway, In the photos section, I noticed a .gif of a glass gauge prototype/plans. I am curious 
if this is actual size, so all measurements would be accurate. I would like to make one myself, 
and I just want to know if I have to resize the image at all. 

Thanks!

Quinn

            <pre class='message__body'>You can check this yourself by printing the scale out and measuring it in
mm.  50 on the scale = 25 mm.
