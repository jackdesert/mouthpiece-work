I was send these to another list member, and figured all of you would 
be interested:

Here are some measurements I took off of new Vandoren and Chedeville 
pieces.

Keep in mind my feeler set is: .0015/.005/.010/.016/.025/.035/tip 
opening in thousandths 

A line like this: | - is used to separate L/R rail measurements.

Chedeville Clarinet c/c 04:  34 - 27.5|28 - 22 - 17|17.5 - 11 - 4 -
 .041"

Chedeville clarinet c/c 09:  36 - 28.5|29 - 23.5|24 - 18 - 13 - 6 -
 .045"

Vandoren M30: 39 - 31 - 25 - 20 - 13.5 - 6 - .045"

Vandoren B40 Lyre: 37.5 - 29 - 23.75 - 18.5 - 13 - 6 - .048"

Vandoren B45:  34 - 27|27.5 - 22 - 16 - 10|10.25 - 4 - .045"

Selmer HS**:  32 - 26 - 21 - 16.25 - 12 - 7 - .050"

Vandoren V13:  37.5 - 29.5 - 24 - 18.5 - 10.5 - 6 - .046"

Vandoren M13: 37 - 28 - 22 - 17 - 11.5 - 4 - .040"

Zinner 4*K German blank (Steve Fox&#39;s piece): 43.5 - 34 - 26 - 18 - 9 -
 1 - .037"

R. Caravan: 32 - 26.5 - 22 - 17 - 12 - 5.5 - .047"


Hope you can make some use of this.

Merlin

            <pre class='message__body'>Merlin,

Thanks.  I&#39;ll plot them to see what they look like.  A related question 
is, "which of these play well?".  I measured all of the clarinet pieces 
that I have, but most of them don&#39;t play very well, so they&#39;re probably 
not good models for refacing target numbers...

Those pieces are mostly new, and play as they were designed to. In 
essence, they all play well, though with varying reed setups and 
primarily for classical playing.

The Steve Fox m/p for example; it sounds amazing when he plays it, 
but you have to use German cut reeds that are REALLY hard.
