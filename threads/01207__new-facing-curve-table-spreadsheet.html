            <pre class='message__body'>See "Facing Curve Table.xls" in the Files - Methods section.

You input your feeler set, your desired tip openings, facing lengths, 
and tip rail thickness for up to 12 facing curves.  Follow the usage 
instructions and the spreadsheet will automatically solve for the 
glass gage numbers you need.  You can solve any 12 curves you want.  
Mix up alto, tenor, etc.  Open, closed, long, short.  You just need a 
feel for good tip openings, facing lengths and tip rail thicknesses.  
That comes from measuring and playing a lot of pieces (or a few good 
ones).

I saved this file in a MS Excel 95 format so older Excel versions 
could read it.  I also do not recall if the "Solver" feature is a 
standard Excel feature or if you need to do a custom install 
procedure to get it.  If it is not on your pull down menu in Excel, 
try to custom install this feature.

Fancy spreadsheets can be a real "can of worms" to explain and 
support.  Power spreadsheet users and those with a good math 
background should have no problems.  Hopefully all interested users 
will get some benefit out of this.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

That&#39;s great - thanks!!

Here at work, I&#39;m using Excel 2000 - I had to click 
Tools-> Add-ins, and then select Solver Add-in to install
the Solver.

Hmmmm... at home I&#39;m using some counterfeit spreadsheet tool,
from Corel, I believe. I probably doesn&#39;t have the Solver function.

Not a big deal - I&#39;ll plug in my feelers, tips, and lengths here,
solve it, print it out and bring it home.

Thanks again!
-Pete
