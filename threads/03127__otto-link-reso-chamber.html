            <pre class='message__body'>One of my friend gave me an old Link reso tenor that has been  badly 
worked.
Any of your mouthpiece wizard like to take a look at it.Too hard for me 
without a measuring kit.
The table,the tip and the baffle  has been touched.I could send 
pictures if some one want to see it.
I cant see the number on the table it has been sanded.
I hope i dont make mistakes in the writing bcause i&#39;m french 
canadian.If you ever
see some  i&#39;m sorry.
i send my deepest thought to the Pope J.P.II  he died today.
peace on earth
