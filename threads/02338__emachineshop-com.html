            <pre class='message__body'>I played around many hours with this software and finally got a blank 
design close to the real thing.  I posted some screen shots of the 3D 
rendering of the design in the Photos CAD album.

After generating a design, you can select a material and get instant 
price quotes.  The quotes are fast, but the design work is tedious 
and you need to be really good at geometry.  The design tools are 
very basic, so you need to make a lot of temporary construction lines 
and arcs to create complex shapes.

I think the quotes are reasonable.  Two CNC made blanks will cost 
$105 each.  5 will be $51 each. 10 = $31 and 20 = $21.  These are 
brass blanks.  You can get 10 non-CNC clear Acrylic blanks for $17 
each.

I dont know about the quality of machining.  But this sure is neat 
technology.  Hand finishing would still be needed to make a great 
piece.  Or you can skip the finishing and just market the heck out of 
them (gee, that hasn&#39;t been done, huh?).

            <pre class='message__body'>That is surprisingly cheap. Any takers for these blanks?

            <pre class='message__body'>Duh, I had not really thought of a group funded order.  I just wanted to
see if the process had merit.  I could try and refine the design some more
(which might add a little cost) and we could consider a group order if
