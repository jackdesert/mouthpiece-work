After generating a design, you can select a material and get instant 
price quotes.  The quotes are fast, but the design work is tedious 
and you need to be really good at geometry.  The design tools are 
very basic, so you need to make a lot of temporary construction lines 
and arcs to create complex shapes.

I think the quotes are reasonable.  Two CNC made blanks will cost 
$105 each.  5 will be $51 each. 10 = $31 and 20 = $21.  These are 
brass blanks.  You can get 10 non-CNC clear Acrylic blanks for $17 
each.

I dont know about the quality of machining.  But this sure is neat 
technology.  Hand finishing would still be needed to make a great 
piece.  Or you can skip the finishing and just market the heck out of 
them (gee, that hasn&#39;t been done, huh?).
