            <pre class='message__body'>

I&#39;ve tried both Legere and Fibracell, on Tenor. 



I liked the way the Legere played, however it had a fatal fault for me. 



For some reason, no matter how I fought it, it lead me back to an old habit of biting. 

Anyone else found this? 



The Fibracell feels more like cane and plays well and the same everytime I pick it up. 

The tone seems buzzy to me, but others don&#39;t seem to hear it that way. 

If being able to count on a reed working is more important than tone, I grab the Fibracell. 

Otherwise I struggle with cane.

fibracell on alto.

            <pre class='message__body'>The reason I decided to try synthetic reeds was because I had a biting habit with cane, particularly when they were well wetted. The Legere has cured the habit, because there&#39;s no need to bite.
