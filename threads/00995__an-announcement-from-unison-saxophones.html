At the upcoming World Saxophone Congress in Minneapolis next week,
Unison will be exhibiting a keyless saxophone as was used by Sigurd
Rascher. These instruments will be available by special order and are a
great aid in teaching/learning mastery of the altissimo range.. Please
feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

Sounds like Unison is really looking to expand their market, and for that I 
applaude them.

I&#39;d like to make a suggestion for their consideration.  I believe there&#39;s a 
market for a good, intermediate-level soprano sax in C.  There are a lot of 
hobbyist players out there playing Bb sopranos in churches (as I do), who 
would appreciate a good C soprano.

Food for thought...

Mike Ruhl

            <pre class='message__body'>We have discussed building other members of the saxophone family,
including a bass, a low B flat bari, a C soprano, and a sopranino.
Unison is a small company, and we&#39;re currently having trouble meeting
demand for your current line. We don&#39;t think that the potential demand
for these horns justifies the tooling costs. We may possible reconsider
this when we are caught up on existing orders, but right now it&#39;s just
not an option for us.
