please, some friend there have information about? 
I got a nice Pendler metal clarinet, just for curiosity and maybe to
fix when I&#39;ll have time, but mouthpiece is not on the case! I payed it
a few bucks so I didn&#39;t worry about the missing mp, but now is the
time to do something for!
Somebody knows where to get a mouthpiece for it? some factory still
make it or the only way is to find used on the net?
Thanks. Gian Luca

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, any clarinet mouthpiece should work. However, you need the 
neckpiece that receives a standard mouthpiece. Many times the vintage 
metal clarinets sold in pawn shops and in auctions are missing the 
neckpiece.

Clark Fobes makes an inexpensive plastic mpc called the Debut.  This is 
a great piece for new players.  Available just about everywhere.

If I was starting to play clari this is what I&#39;d want.
