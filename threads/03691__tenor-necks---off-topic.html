It seems that a Yanagisawa neck will do a pretty good job on a Yamaha.
Never tried it myself. 

On my Pre Chu Berry the Yanagisawa neck performs great and is better
in tune then a original neck.

Cheers.

the heart of the saxophone&#39;s sound, IMHO. They are absolutely NOT
interchangable or "one size fits all". There are MANY variables, and you

It seems that a Yanagisawa neck will do a pretty good job on a Yamaha. Never
tried it myself.

On my Pre Chu Berry the Yanagisawa neck performs great and is better in tune
then a original neck.

Cheers.
