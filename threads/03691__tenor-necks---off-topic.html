It seems that a Yanagisawa neck will do a pretty good job on a Yamaha.
Never tried it myself. 

On my Pre Chu Berry the Yanagisawa neck performs great and is better
in tune then a original neck.

Cheers.
Anthony

            <pre class='message__body'>Tim Price, the most requested clinician for Selmer, and great all around

He loves it.

Herschel, email me directly, I&#39;ll put you in touch with Tim.

            <pre class='message__body'>Necks are something I have studied and experimented with for years. They are
the heart of the saxophone&#39;s sound, IMHO. They are absolutely NOT
interchangable or "one size fits all". There are MANY variables, and you
should carefully research any changes you are considering.

            <pre class='message__body'>They&#39;re made in Greece, and don&#39;t fit or work on every horn. However, they
ones they do fit get pretty interesting results. They&#39;re expensive, and you
have to take care against cracking (I&#39;ve seen some that have split), but
they play nicely on recent production Selmers. The sound they produce is a
matter of taste: Some like it, some do not.

Necks do make a difference.  But I have always prefered my original 
necks to others I have tried, unless the original was dented a lot.
