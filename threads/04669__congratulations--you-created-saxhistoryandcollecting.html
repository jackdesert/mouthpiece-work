            <pre class='message__body'> We&#39;re getting too many off topic messages in the saxophone repair group
about horn values and history. I&#39;ve established a group (link below) to
discuss saxophone history, value, age, restoration, and related topics. This
is, of course, one of my very favorite subjects, and I would like to take
the opportunity to invite you to join me in discussion there!
