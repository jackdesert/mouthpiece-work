            <pre class='message__body'>I didn&#39;t have pictures until today......here&#39;s the "finishing touch" on the Saxgourmet Dragon&#39;s Tongue Delrin tenor mouthpiece: a removable shank weight WHICH WILL USE A DIFFERENT SCREW....this weight gives the mouthpiece two different sounds.....yes, I know several different mouthpieces have been offered with a similar feature in the past.....we believe that through a lot of experimenting we&#39;ve figured out the optimum amount of mass to add to the shank
