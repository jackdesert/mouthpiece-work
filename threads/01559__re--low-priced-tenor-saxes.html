            <pre class='message__body'>A friend recently bought a D Parker Tenor Sax on EBAY for $250 !  Having 
octave key binding, they asked my help.  It sure LOOKS good, apparently well-made, 
didn&#39;t play it, as yet.  I looked further on EBAY, found many "German" tenors 
with many names, cheap!  What&#39;s the story?, are these poorly made Asiatics? 
prob. for our markets? HELP,  Don  Sorry, Chris, I&#39;ve never heard of a Pocket 
Sax, I&#39;m just a clarinetist!!

            <pre class='message__body'>With all due respect guys, this group is intended for the discussion of 
working on mouthpieces.  You&#39;re not likely to get many responses regarding 
instruments.  I recommend you take this discussion over to one of the 
general saxophone discussion forums, like Sax on the Web.

Mike
