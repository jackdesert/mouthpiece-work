            <pre class='message__body'>With all due respect guys, this group is intended for the discussion of 
working on mouthpieces.  You&#39;re not likely to get many responses regarding 
instruments.  I recommend you take this discussion over to one of the 
general saxophone discussion forums, like Sax on the Web.
