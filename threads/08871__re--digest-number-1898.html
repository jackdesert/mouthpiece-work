post material that is off topic from mouthpiece work? Are they more important?"

That would be a twisted interpretation.  

Objectively seen, my post says nothing more than a previous post of yours, which I will paraphrase, if I may, 

"If you&#39;re not discussing what you want to discuss here, it&#39;s your own fault."  

With that in mind, I have to ask - Am I correct in assuming then, that complaining about the theoretical MC conversation is your subject of choice?

I have limited expertise but great interest in most mouthpiece matters.
I have learned a great deal from reading many of the posts on this board.

> The view that Toby and I adhere to is the only one that satisfies all requirements.Â  The only solution to #2 is:Â  The neck is not part of the missing cone or the substitution, however, the 2 dimensional constriction caused by it&#39;s reduced opening diameter, is, and is the necessary element to complete the mouthpiece + constriction components which constitute the substitution.Â Â  It would be easier to see if the saxophone used a clarinet tenon style mouthpiece coupling.Â  Then the frs could easily be checked correctly using just the mouthpiece and a piece of tape, with a neck opening diameter hole in it, stuck over the end.Â  The mechanical aspects of the mouthpiece over the neck coupling do not change the acoustical characteristics of the instrument, and Benade&#39;s confusing contradictions are due to his attempt to be mechanically practical, rather than acoustically accurate.

The limiting case for the Frs, and the one that gives the most accurate picture of how closely the resonance of the mpc matches the resonance of the missing apex, is one in which only the mpc is measured.

The "neck" doesn&#39;t enter into this at all, except to provide the transition to the main body tube, and anyway the length of the neck is arbitrary, comprising a different percentage of the body tube in bass, bari, tenor and alto, and not even existing on many sops, as Lance points out.

"Am I correct that you believe that the more a member posts, the greater their status and say-so in the group? Is there a “three post minimum per set” or something like that? What about members who consistently post material that is off topic from mouthpiece work? Are they more important?"

That would be a twisted interpretation.  

Objectively seen, my post says nothing more than a previous post of yours, which I will paraphrase, if I may, 

"If you&#39;re not discussing what you want to discuss here, it&#39;s your own fault."  

With that in mind, I have to ask - Am I correct in assuming then, that complaining about the theoretical MC conversation is your subject of choice?
