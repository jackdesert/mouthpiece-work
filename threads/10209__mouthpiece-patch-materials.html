The only questions are: 1) how well does the adhesive backing stick to a
mouthpiece. And 2) if the plastic wants to be perfectly flat (and high
density stuff has very good "plastic memory", it may peel itself off the
arched beak of a mouthpiece over time.

Haven&#39;t bought it yet, because I discovered I already had something
similar: 3M V-Seal Door Weather strip. This also looks to be a tough high
density plastic tape. The adhesive is only on 1/2 the tape width, so I
rubbed it off and stuck a patch on the mouthpiece using double-sided
scotch tape (actually not scotch brand, some knock-off) and this seems to
be sticking well. I did have to heat the patch a bit over an alcohol lamp
and give it a curve to match the mouthpiece beak, so it wouldn&#39;t unpeel
itself.

For people who like the thicker, softer black rubber patch, but have problem cutting through, years ago Santy Runyon showed me the trick of putting the tougher clear patch over the black rubber patch.  They are cut on the same die cutting tools and are the same size and shape.  

With a twinkle in his eye and smile he said, "... but if this gets around they won&#39;t buy so many black patches."

The same patches are sold under both the Runyon and Selmer labels, as are the Runyon Side Key Riser and Palm Key Risers, Clarinet and Sax Thumb Savers, and other small accessories.

            <pre class='message__body'>I buy patches from Mike Hughes and put on every mouthpiece I reface.

His patches are really thin, so the mouthpiece feels almost like it patchless. It has a "hygiene layer", than also makes is easier to line up the patch. And they are cheap.
