Anyway, I think I&#39;ve finally found the right stuff - Ultra-high-density
polyethylene tape. This is very tough slick stuff.

The only questions are: 1) how well does the adhesive backing stick to a
mouthpiece. And 2) if the plastic wants to be perfectly flat (and high
density stuff has very good "plastic memory", it may peel itself off the
arched beak of a mouthpiece over time.

Haven&#39;t bought it yet, because I discovered I already had something
similar: 3M V-Seal Door Weather strip. This also looks to be a tough high
density plastic tape. The adhesive is only on 1/2 the tape width, so I
rubbed it off and stuck a patch on the mouthpiece using double-sided
scotch tape (actually not scotch brand, some knock-off) and this seems to
be sticking well. I did have to heat the patch a bit over an alcohol lamp
and give it a curve to match the mouthpiece beak, so it wouldn&#39;t unpeel
itself.

tougher clear patch on top.  To date, I haven&#39;t cut through one.  I used

well for my students.  With the tougher material on top and the softer

Although I recommend for this purpose, the application of dental acrylic monomer and dust to me is the best protection for both
the pulp and plastic mouthpiece as the metal.

I use the Runyon patches.  I apply the soft black patch first, then the tougher clear patch on top.  To date, I haven&#39;t cut through one.  I used to go through the black ones really fast.  This combo is also working well for my students.  With the tougher material on top and the softer on bottom, it gives slightly without allowing enough "traction" to bite through.

For people who like the thicker, softer black rubber patch, but have problem cutting through, years ago Santy Runyon showed me the trick of putting the tougher clear patch over the black rubber patch.  They are cut on the same die cutting tools and are the same size and shape.  

With a twinkle in his eye and smile he said, "... but if this gets around they won&#39;t buy so many black patches."

The same patches are sold under both the Runyon and Selmer labels, as are the Runyon Side Key Riser and Palm Key Risers, Clarinet and Sax Thumb Savers, and other small accessories.

His patches are really thin, so the mouthpiece feels almost like it patchless. It has a "hygiene layer", than also makes is easier to line up the patch. And they are cheap.
