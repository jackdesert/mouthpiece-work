            <pre class='message__body'>Good day guys..
 

 

 I tried to plot this mouthpiece and stumbled upon this reading/plotting
 

 

 As you can see, I used a 60mm feeler gauge and it fell between lines 14 and 16..
 

 

 How are you going to plot this? 14.5 or 15? or you consider this as 16 even though it didn't fall on the 16th
 

 

 

 Thank you

            <pre class='message__body'>I think it is very important that you read that as 15.    You also need to develop the skill to read the glass gauge to the nearest .5 and .25 in my opinion to do good work.   I actually read mine to the nearest .1 but I do not think that is necessary.

To read to the nearest .5, you need to visually subdivide the space between the lines into 4 parts.
