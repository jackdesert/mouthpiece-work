            <pre class='message__body'>I have heard that Anderson will plate or replate a piece, but will 
not guarentee the bite plate to stay put.  Does anyone have 
experiance with this?

I would think bite plates that are casted or formed in place would be 
fine.  The ones that are cut to size and glued in would have 
potential problems.
