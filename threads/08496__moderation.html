            <pre class='message__body'>It pains me to moderate this site.  Please consider this place a room in my house where you are all guests discussing topics.  Act accordingly.  State you disagreements once or maybe twice if clarification is needed.  Restating them over and over again come across as petty bickering that I would not like in my house.

The discussion on mouthpiece volume theory belongs here.  Even if it does not work out, it will not be a waste of time.  We can learn the limits of the theory in practice.

The discussion on mouthpiece marketing belongs here too.  But I think we may have reached the limits of input our members have.  As Ed Z suggested, a marketing guru or forum may have other insights.
