            <pre class='message__body'>It pains me to moderate this site.  Please consider this place a room in my house where you are all guests discussing topics.  Act accordingly.

The discussion on mouthpiece volume theory belongs here.  Even if it does not work out, it will not be a waste of time.  We can learn the limits of the theory in practice.

The discussion on mouthpiece marketing belongs here too.  But I think we may have reached the limits of input our members have.  As Ed Z suggested, a marketing guru or forum may have other insights.
