            <pre class='message__body'>I could use a little help with these things...

I&#39;d like to be able to plug in the gauge sizes, facing length and tip 
opening, and have the glass gauge numbers shown for a radial arc.

That seems to be what these tables are intended for, but I&#39;m having 
trouble getting them to work.

What problems are you having?  Do you know where to start?

            <pre class='message__body'>Not a whole bunch. The spreadsheet program that I have here is part 
of the Microsoft Works package.

I&#39;m also interested in how to adapt the sheets for the mouthpieces I 
work on. Much of what I&#39;m doing right now is with smaller tips. The 
largest feeler I use on many of the measurements I&#39;m doing is .050.

Has anyone done something similar using a scientific calculator? 
Seems like it would be easier to have on the workbench.

Microsoft Works should be fine.  I stored the sample spreadsheet in 
an older Excel 95 format so it could be read by most spreadsheet 
software out there.

It helps a lot to have basic spreadsheet skills.  Running through a 
tutorial would be good if one is availale.  Otherwise, browse through 
the Help menu.

The inputs are the cells with blue text.  Not all spreadsheets use 
this convention.  This is just how I layed out this one.

I had set up this spreadsheet so you could put in a set of 5 "Spec" 
readings from a Eric Brand system, fit a curve throught them, then 
generate your own gage goals for facing (L) based on your own feelers 
(F).  You can skip the Eric Brand step by deleting all the numbers in 
the Spec column except the first one for .0015" and the last one for 
Tip.  You need at least these two to create a facing curve.  

The Spec for .0015" is the desired facing length.  The Spec at "Tip" 
is what you want the glass gage to reed at the tip opening.  Zero is 
shown if you want to read the tip opening at the very tip of the 
mouthpiece.  If you want to read the tip inside the tip rail, you nee 
to change the zero to a glass gage number that is the width of the 
tip rail.  For a .030" wide tip rail, use 1.5 as a Spec for the Tip.

Enter your desired tip opening at the bottom of the "F" column.  The 
rest of the "F" column is the set of feeler gages.  If you have an 
Eric Brand Spec, set them to the Eric Brand feelers at first.  Ajust 
R and M until the Error Sum is minimzed.  This creates a radial arc 
curve that is a good fit through the "Spec" numbers.  Once you have a 
R and M you like, you can change the feelers in F to your set of 
feelers and it will recalculate the glass gage targets (L) you need 
to shoot for.  You can delete the rows you do not need or just ignore 
them.

The "L Inc" column is not important.  It was just my way of looking 
at the feeler gage increments.  I concluded the Eric Brand set was 
not complete enough to do the work I wanted.

If you know your way around spradsheets, you can look at each cell to 
see what formulas are in them and which cells they get their info 
from.  Being able to reverse engineer a spreadsheet by looking in the 
cells is a basic skill that helps in understanding spreadsheets 
developed by someone else.

I&#39;ll put a revised version of this spreadsheet on the Site.

The one thing Works doesn&#39;t seem to like is embedded charts - it 
won&#39;t display them.

This is exactly what I ended up doing!

It&#39;s very interesting to see what happens when you put in a known set 
of measurements and compare them to a radial arc to see how close 
they are.

Were you able to make your own graph?  This is the real power of the 
method.  You can plot what you are working on vs the goal curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, I was able to make graphs. They don&#39;t come out looking quite as 
cool as yours though.

I think there are some limitations on what this spreadsheet prog can 
do.
