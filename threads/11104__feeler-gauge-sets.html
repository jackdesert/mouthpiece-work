I picked up a 5 feeler set from musicmedic.com, but would be interested in a more complete set at a reasonable price. I am considering to order multiple sets, but don&#39;t think I want the headache of selling off the extra sets.

Let me know! THANKS!

            <pre class='message__body'>Since I do aerospace mechanical inspection more than work on mouthpieces
I have to ask a "feeler gauge" question. 

From the discussions I think that blade type feeler gauges are being
used.  These are the type commonly used to set gaps on internal engine
components such a valve gaps and spacing.  Of course these are widely
used in mechanical assemblies.

Another type of feeler gauge is the wire type that are used for open gap
measurement.  They are typically a straight section of wire of known
diameter or a loop of the wire.  These in  bygone decades were commonly
used for measuring the electrode gap on spark plugs. 

Wire gauges tend to be harder to use well but can be more accurate both
for curve contour measurement in the hands of a good mechanical
inspector.  They require more "feel" for the measurement but can give
several points on a curve like a mouthpiece.  That is you can quickly
find a .015 point and then a .022 point and then a .035. 
has anyone played with this on mouthpieces?

            <pre class='message__body'>Maybe I got a bum set of feelers. After more playing around, I realized I can get drastically different readings by moving my feelers left and right.

The worst example of this is when I measure the left rail of a mouthpiece with the .034 feeler. When I measure using the left side of the feeler (furthest from the hole in the feeler) it reads 22mmx2. When I measure around the middle I get 19, and nearest the hole on the right side it returns back to 20.

And these variations correspond to the caliper measurements I took nearing the edges as well.

So I marked what I consider to be the "most consistent spots" on the feelers with a marker. I get more consistent readings when I stick to those areas.

These feelers are more football shaped than ideal, it seems--inconsistent on two axes. :(

            <pre class='message__body'>Thought about that.  Problem is the line through the points where the wire contacts the gauge and the mouthpiece won&#39;t be perpendicular to the gauge.  So your readings will be offset.  Which could be corrected for, except the error will vary with the slope of the tangent to the facing curve, which varies.  This is also the reason for using square edge feelers instead of round.  

I suppose you could make a facing spreadsheet that assumes this sort of reading, but the math is more complicated. And really, how much more accurate is it?  How much more accurate is useful anyway?  Once you&#39;ve just about hit pretty much all your target numbers you playtest and adjust the facing accordingly anyway, and the numbers go out the window.
