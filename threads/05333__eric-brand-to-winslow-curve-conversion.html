Apparently he had bitten all the way through the beak several times, had it filled in, and the side and tip rails of his mouthpieces were very worn to the point they could no longer be refaced.

It can be done but there is not a simple conversion factor.

The strategy would be to fit a curve through the data points gathered from
the Brand set.  Then you would need to pull the Winslow points off the
fitted curve.  The results would depend on what kind of curve you chose and
how close you want it to fit your Brand data.  A spline or high order
polynomial could run exactly through each Brand data point.  But this would
duplicate bumps and flat sections that may be defects, not features. 
However for clarinet curves, the bumps and flats might be features.

The spreadsheets on the Yahoo site mostly use a radial facing curve.  The
Brand data could be typed in and a radial curve fitted through the data. 
Then the Winslow or other feeler sets could be typed in to pull glass gage
readings off the radial curve.
