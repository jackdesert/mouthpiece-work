            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Members,

I have a question/problem I hope you may provide suggestions.
I play a Selmer Series II Low A Bari Sax.  I use a metal
Guy Hawkins #115, a Masteller (named after music store - made
by Babbitt, and a B7 Rico Royal Graphtonite.

I love the tone each mpc produces, however, the question is
I tend to feel resistance performing low note exercies.  I
had horn checked a few months ago, and it does play much
more satisfactoriy, but many times the low note response
may be unpredictable and hesitant especially tounging.  I
do use Lavoz and Marco reeds - not my favorite but came
with instrument.

I am so surprised by that Rico Royal.  Even the altissimo
are not much effort to play.

Sometimes I wonder if I may need a more opened tipped
mouthpiece like a 125/130.  Your advice/suggestions would
be geatly apprecieated.

Saxually Yours,
Harry E. Cartwright

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Either have an experienced refacer check the mouthpieces, or start reading
some of the general info from this newsgroup's earlier posts and archived
files to see if you want to get the tools and measure/assess them yourself.
After all, this newsgroup is for those who practice or want to learn refacing.  
  
I'm guessing, but you probably don't need a more open piece, although you
might benefit from a better facing curve.
