            <pre class='message__body'>Hello everybody,
   
  A prominent sax retailer who seems very well-informed to me gave me some info I&#39;d like to confirm if possible. In a former life I posessed a Selmer Mk VI and always played a Berg 110/2/M on it. Recently, I&#39;ve gotten back into playing again and thought I&#39;d get a similar Berg and use it. But the sax has changed. I now play a 1972 Buffet SDA. I tried the Berg out on a Selmer and it played fantastic, but found out it was dead when I tried it on the Buffet. The aforementioned sax retailer explained that it was because the Buffet is a larger bore tenor than the Selmer and requires a larger chamber mouthpiece. The bullet chamber Berg has a smallish chamber. I purchased a larger chamber mpc and it works very well on the Buffet. Can you all confirm this: Is this because of the ratio of bore to mpc chamber volume or something else? I haven&#39;t done sax bore measurements, but I noticed when I began playing the Buffet that it felt bigger in the hand. I was also told that Keilwerth
 horns are also large-bore. Are there available data on horn bores?
   
  Thanks, JT

            <pre class='message__body'>The thing that i have noticed about the size of the sax is that the bigger 
the sax the brighter the mpc you can go with to match better. what i would 
recommend is if you like a berg go with a higher baffle maybe a 110/1 or 
110/0

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

Interesting you should say that. That&#39;s precisely the opposite of 
what the retailer in question said. He said a high baffle would be 
the death of this horn. And in fact, I have to agree: of all the 
pieces I have played that have worked on this horn, none of them have 
had a high baffle: all have had lower baffles and larger chambers.

Does anyone have a theoretical understanding of this?

Thanks, JT

            <pre class='message__body'>Your retailer may be talking about a match for intonation whereas Joe was
saying a dark sax matches well with a bright mouthpiece.  This is a matter
of personal taste in sound.

Or it just could be different experiances.  We all make conclusions based
on our sampling.  Sometimes the sample is just a few sax and mouthpiece
combos.  Or, if it is many over time, we do not accurately compare results
obtained years apart.  Contradictions will exist.  Even in the presence of
theory.
