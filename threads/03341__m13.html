Mine is about 8 years old and  measures .043 with Steve&#39;s gage, but it&#39;s a 
"Profile 88" Model M13 so it maybe a little different.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve noticed that with clarinet tip openings it makes quite a
difference where the tip opening is measured from.  For instance, one
of my pieces (Gigliotti No. 3) measures 1.12mm at the inside tip rail,
but this becomes more like 1.2mm at the absolute tip opening.  The tip
rail is about 0.75mm wide.

Of course, this issue is similar with sax mouthpieces as well, but
more exaggerated on clarinet because while the tip rail width is often
about the same as on sax, the tip openings are a lot smaller.

Vandoren seem to quote the tip opening at the inner tip rail edge
rather than the absolute tip opening.  At least that was the case on
my V16 clarinet piece.  But I&#39;m sure some of the other makers are
quoting the absolute tip opening.

I think this makes comparing tip openings by various makers from some
of the published charts somewhat doubtful . . .

Regards,
Andrew

            <pre class='message__body'>I recall comparing some Vandoren sax MP facings to their brochure and
concluding that they seem to be measuring to the very tip.  Also, the
facing lengths in the brochure were longer than what I was getting with a
.0015" feeler.  Made me think they were for a theoretical .000" feeler (the
true tangent point).

I have not made any comparisons recently.  They generally have become less
important to me over time.  Occassionally a client wants something similar
to "X".  But soemthing in the ballpark that is done well will beat out
on-spec done not-so-well.

            <pre class='message__body'>I play a M13 (with American "15" tuning A = 440hz, and profile 88),
and have measured several (maybe 5 or 6) of them recently. It&#39;s a
popular mouthpiece around here. All that I measured are within these
specs:

Tip: 106 to 109 / 0.042 to 0.043
Length of facing: 21.5 to 22.5 mm
Radius of curvature: 8.7 to 9.3 inches (best  circular fit)

All the ones I have measured are slightly more open on the right side
than the left side. Typically the readings are something like this
(for the left ... right side is about 1 scale mark or 0.5mm more open).

0.0015 @ 35.0 to 37.5
0.010 @ 21.0 to 21.5
0.024 @ 10.0 to 12.0 
0.034 @ 3.0 to 4.0
Tip 106 to 109

I found one with a flat spot. It&#39;s sound was noticably inferior to
others without flat spots. I also found that the tables of these are
sometimes not flat (some have a high spot), and they play better (more
reed-friendly, and better response) after flattening the table. This
can typically be done without any change in the readings.
