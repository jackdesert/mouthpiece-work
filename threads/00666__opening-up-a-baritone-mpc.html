            <pre class='message__body'>My 2 cents: you can certainly open it up that much, but you are definitely going to change the sound and reponse because in effect you will be raising the baffle by lowering the side rails and tip rail. You will have to cut quite a bit of material out just behind the tip rail because what will happen is that the tip rail itself will disappear into the material of the baffle. This is doable, but it is quite tricky work since it is easy to slip with your file/dremel/sandpaper and scar the tip rail.

In my own  limited experience if you can re-establish the correct geometry by taking material off the roof near the tip you will find that the sound of the piece remains esentially the same.

Hopefully someone else with more experience can elaborate.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby mentions the most common way of approaching opening a tip.  In 
this method, you use the existing table and you rework the tip open 
and reshape the baffle and tip rail as needed.  Most players like the 
additional baffle this method brings to a piece.  They were looking 
for a change anyway.  However, on some narrow beak pieces (duck 
bills) and for large tip openings, this method shortens the tip too 
much and destroys what the piece was all about.  Also, on vintage 
pieces with concave side walls, you can run out of usable side rails.

The other method is to cut the heel of the table to angle it so the 
tip becomes more open.  You need to establish a new flat table and 
reface the rails a little, but this method is a lot less traumatic to 
the tip area of a piece.  It takes patience and practice.  The table 
area is much larger than the rail area, so more material needs to be 
sanded away.
