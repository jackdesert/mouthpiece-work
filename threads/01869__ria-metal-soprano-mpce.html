            <pre class='message__body'>I recently found a RIA #4 metal soprano mpce I had forgotten about, I 
bought it back in the 80&#39;s from Art-Shell in NYC. It has a baffle and 
scooped out chamber. It is a grey/silver metal. I&#39;m not sure what 
material it is made of, steel, silver plated brass, silverite? It has 
a nice core sound, but pretty bright, and also loud, projects well. 
Does anyone have info, comments about these mpces? Although #4 seems 
pretty open, it plays ok with reeds I use on a Lamberson F maj 7 
mpce, about 3 strength.

            <pre class='message__body'>If it feels heavy for its size, it is probably siver-plated brass.  If it
feels light, it is probably a high quality aluminum.

            <pre class='message__body'>it feels very heavy, but the plating is only slightly tarnished inside, can silver plating stay shiny that long?
