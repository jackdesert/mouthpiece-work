            <pre class='message__body'>I have an Alto piece which is very obviously the same model as the two tenor
pieces with a metal shank on that website page re: Lelandais.  It is marked
"Excelsior" at the top of the body just below the beak, with a B.H.B below
that diagonally in large letters, and in small writing below towards the
right "Super True Lay".  There is no facing indication.  The chamber is
quite large, and the side walls are scooped out all the way to the tip.  It
is quite short (80.4 mm) versus a Selmer HR piece (93.5 mm.)

I also have a Lelandais Super Jazz brass tenor piece which I regularly use.
