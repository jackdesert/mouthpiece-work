            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry, Dukoff HR had fluted _chambers_ for a while.  Lakey metals were 
heavily fluted in the early days.  Can&#39;t say I remember seeing a fluted 
hard rubber.

            <pre class='message__body'>The sides were fluted?

Any idea where I can find pics? Google is only returning pics of the fluted chamber...

Thanks again.

Early Dukoff HR pieces were very heavily fluted.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have an Alto piece which is very obviously the same model as the two tenor
pieces with a metal shank on that website page re: Lelandais.  It is marked
"Excelsior" at the top of the body just below the beak, with a B.H.B below
that diagonally in large letters, and in small writing below towards the
right "Super True Lay".  There is no facing indication.  The chamber is
quite large, and the side walls are scooped out all the way to the tip.  It
is quite short (80.4 mm) versus a Selmer HR piece (93.5 mm.)

I also have a Lelandais Super Jazz brass tenor piece which I regularly use.
