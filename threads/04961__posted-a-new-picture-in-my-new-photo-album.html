            <pre class='message__body'>...concernig a completely hand made and hand finished wood mouthpiece. 
We (me and my friend) started by a square piece of wood. This is the 
first but not the last (I hope) serious sounding :) mouthpiece I ever 
produced. Two professional players tried it recently remaining quite 
impressed. I reached this important (at least for me) result after some 
years of trials and errors and mainly following the advices contained 
in this workgroup. So that is just to say thank you to everyone!!!

Hello Dan

My compliments for this real fine peace of work. What kind of wood did 
you use. I am also thinking about making a Moutpiece made of wood.

Regards Cok

Thanks Cok,
I used tree heath. In the place where I was born (the south part of 
Italy) exists one of the best (if not the best) quality of this 
precious and wonderful looking wood.
