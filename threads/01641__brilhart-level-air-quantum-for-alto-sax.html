            <pre class='message__body'>HI, seeing photo seems me that the Brilhart Level Air (new model by Selmer)
and&#39; equal to my Runyon Quantum Metal for alto sax! 
And&#39; so? 

I have known that:
They have the same interiors. But on the outside the Brilhart Level Air is the same as a Runyon Smoothbore.

Nevertheless also the outside seems identical to my Runyon Quantum Metal and not to the Smoothbore?!

Nevertheless to me it interests to be certain that they have the same inside (interiors)
because&#39; I wanted to purchase a Brilhart Level Air but if the news and&#39;
confirmed me I will purchase the Smoothbore.

Confirm me that:
Runyon Quantum Metal and Brilhart Level Air They have the same interiors?

And&#39; a great honor to be able to belong to this group ;-)
The best regards
Thanks very much
Gabriele (Italy)

This is true for the modern LAs.

            <pre class='message__body'>True enough, but they don&#39;t play the same due to the significantly thinner
beak on the Quantum. If you&#39;re jones&#39;n for the old Level Air sound and feel,
check out the ARB metal series from Beechler. Materials and design are very
similar, although the facing has been slightly altered to decrease
resistance. I just got a 9, and love it!
