            <pre class='message__body'>I get a few of these per week. (i.e. emails consisting mainly of a link 
to some website) About one per week is from the mouthpiece work group, 
another 1 or 2 are from business clients.

These should always be deleted, and on no account should one visit the 
links.

Usually they are from persons with aol or yahoo accounts, which suggests 
that the passwords have been obtained somehow, and the person&#39;s mailing 
list has been spammed.

Marjan B (is there such a person here?), change your password.
