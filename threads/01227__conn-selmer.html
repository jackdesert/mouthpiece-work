Conn-Selmer to Close Main Street Facility in Elkhart 
ELKHART, Ind., Oct 3, 2003 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ --
Conn-Selmer, Inc., a subsidiary of Steinway Musical Instruments, Inc.
(NYSE: LVB), announced today that it will be closing one of its three
manufacturing operations in Elkhart, Indiana. This plant&#39;s production
will be transferred to other company-owned facilities. 
John Stoner, President of Conn-Selmer, commented, "Earlier this year, we
began implementing a plan to make our instruments more cost competitive
in the marketplace. Consolidating similar manufacturing operations in
order to increase production efficiency is an integral part of that
plan. Accordingly, we presented U.A.W. Local 612 with a proposal to
relocate our Main Street plant&#39;s production as well as a significant
number of its employees to our other Elkhart facilities. We believe our
proposal was fair and it is unfortunate that the union membership voted
it down." 
The plant closure will impact approximately 90-100 active employees, all
of whom will be offered severance pay. The Company has sufficient
inventory to meet customer needs during the transition of production,
which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2004. 
As a result of the Main Street plant closure, the Company expects to
take charges of $4.0 to $5.0 million over the next few quarters. The
cash portion of these charges is estimated at $3.0 million. 
Dana Messina, CEO of Steinway Musical Instruments, explained, "The band
instrument marketplace remains fiercely competitive. However, we are
confident that our strategy will improve profitability and allow us to
compete more effectively."
