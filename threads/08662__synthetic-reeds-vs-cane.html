            <pre class='message__body'>In the 60&#39;s  the Selmer Co. produced plastic reeds called Ben Davies Vocaltone.
Another, named PTD was of fibreglass/resin composition.
I tried both and found they vibrated more freely than cane, sounded different and cut into the the lower lip at the edges.
I am finding the Rico Plasticover has none of these drawbacks, though they do soften up eventually, like any cane reed.

            <pre class='message__body'>I can&#39;t play with a synthetic reed but I use them for testing pourposes. I also know some very good player who uses them. The only real advantage I see is that some of them last long...
