            <pre class='message__body'>I read somewhere that a clarinet guru made their own scraper to work this area.  I think they hammered the end (or head) of a large nail flat and bent it 90 degs and sharpened it.  

The sanding sticks I sell can do some shaping using 110 grit sandpaper.  But the pads I supply need to be trimmed with scissors to fit inside a clarinet chamber.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith. My dad was that way. Couldnâ€™t find a tool? Just make one.

I hope others may have a dream tool idea that can simplify the process.
