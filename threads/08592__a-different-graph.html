            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know where people are getting these radial curves from.  There are many possible radial curves for mouthpieces with a given facing length and tip opening. Literally an infinite number!  One needs three points to define the circle not just two.   
   It seems to me it would be much better represented by a graph where the Y axis indicates the aperture and the X axis the facing length.  All measurements should be metric and the final product should look like a mouthpiece curve.  With a basic rise to run ratio of 1 to 14 for this Larry Teal mouthpiece the graph would look a little different than what is there as a model in Files section.

            <pre class='message__body'>The "third point" is the requirement that the radial curve is tangent to the table.  There is only one radial curve that is tangent to the table whose curve passes through the tip opening and the facing length.
