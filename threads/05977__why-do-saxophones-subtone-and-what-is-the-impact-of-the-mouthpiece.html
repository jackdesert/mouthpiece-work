            <pre class='message__body'>I have MKVI Tenor.  I have several good mouthpieces that have been professionally refaced; guardalas, otto links mainly; each easily subtones down through the instrument.  I recently acquired an otto link without any link markings (i think it is a transitional from florida usa to babbit); original facing; it outplays all the other mouthpieces but for one thing and one thing only; it refuses to subtone on low B. i am hesistant to have it worked on because i love the bit as it is with the critical exception of the low B subtone; could a quirk in the facing curve cause that??

            <pre class='message__body'>It could be a facing issue; but I&#39;d also check the adjustment of the
articulated G#, which can destabilize the low B and make subtoning
difficult; for whatever reason it has a much greater effect on the low B
than the low Bb.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would guess it has more to do with the chamber than the facing
curve.  Generally mouthpieces that have some sort of baffle, either
the traditional roll-over like most Links have, or a longer baffle,
will subtone but pieces with large chambers and no baffle (really old
Links, legit pieces like Raschers, etc) don&#39;t subtone at all.

  The technique I use, and fairly common, is to take a smaller bite, use more lip, which dampens the reed more.  But also when subtone, you can feel the reed actually vibrating differently.

  My old departed friend Santy Runyon used a different technique.  He would lay his tongue on the bottom of his mouth, with just the tip of his tongue touching the reed right by his bottom lip.  This put the additional damping on the reed, and also allowed for some pretty interesting effects... such as blowing hard while subtone, then pulling the tongue away, for a very substantial attack and full tone.
   
  A third way, not really a subtone, but a way of playing very softly... when a director says, "I want you to play with intensity, as if you are playling loudly, but play very softly."
   
  This involves putting the mouthpiece in your mouth at an angle such that you are blowing on one corner of the reed.  The bottom lip is across the reed from its normal position on one side, and to the corner of the reed on the other side.  This is a technique for playing softly with a wide tip opening mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Paul,
                I find your post very interesting - I guess I never thought
much about sub-tone technique... I just did it.
 
The funny thing is that - when I think about it, I don&#39;t use any of the
techniques you described... or maybe I&#39;m misreading your descriptions.
 
What I do when I sub-tone is that I relax the embouchure... but, more
importantly, I also relax the throat. I think more "Ohhh", than "Hoo". I
hope that makes sense.
 
I also think about using more "warm air", as if fogging up a mirror.
 
When I get time - I&#39;ll experiment with the techniques you described. Thanks
again, Paul!
 
Sincerely,
               Karsten J. Chikuri

            <pre class='message__body'>hi,

before you try to work on the facing, i´d recommend to check, if the  
g# key of the horn
opens up a wee little bit, when you finger the low b (should also  
happen on c# and b flat)
i once had this problem myself, when i tried a mark vi in a shop
if the facing is very short, it could tend to cause similar problems

i&#39;ve got a vintage short shank dukoff for tenor that gave me a

i had it gold plated, and it still work fine. but i still do have the

does anyone know if those pieces were made from the same brass as the  
otto link, or do they already have some strange metal combination in it?
I&#39;ve played a lot of vintage link, sometime with a lot of plating  
loss without getting this strange metal taste in my mouth.
Any suggestion if that taste could be dangerous for health? or where  
it comes from?

            <pre class='message__body'>If your mouth tingles, you could be allergic to brass.  There is no such
thing as brass poisoning.  Brass can have a bad after-taste too that is not
an allergic reaction.  A plating job should eliminate allergic reaction or
the bad after-taste.

I would speculate that the bite plate material could be a problem for you. 
You can try soaking it in mouthwash.

 Any suggestion if that taste could be dangerous for health? or where  
 it comes from?
 thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi thanks for your answer.
that dukoff is definitively brass, no silverite.
could it be that the dukoff brass has an other after-taste than an  
florida link brass?
i expected that the gold plating would take that after taste away,  
but i feel it&#39;s still there.
the gold plating was made by a pro (copper plating then  10 mu silver  
plating and then 5 mu gold plating)
i don&#39;t have a bite plate on it, i just play some some plastic  
protection stickers on it.
that&#39;s a pity because that mpc plays really good.

            <pre class='message__body'>Brass alloys vary quite considerably, and I would guess that different ones taste differently depending on the the composition.

Subject: Re: [MouthpieceWork] Why Do Saxophones Subtone and What is the impact of the mouthpiece

Another thing... there are different ways to subtone.
 
The technique I use, and fairly common, is to take a smaller bite, use more lip, which dampens the reed more.  But also when subtone, you can feel the reed actually vibrating differently.  Not striking the tip rail?  I don&#39;t know, but I feel more resistance.  For this method, I find I have good subtone down to about low D or low C, but not below that.
 
My old departed friend Santy Runyon used a different technique.  He would lay his tongue on the bottom of his mouth, with just the tip of his tongue touching the reed right by his bottom lip.  This put the additional damping on the reed, and also allowed for some pretty interesting effects... such as blowing hard while subtone, then pulling the tongue away, for a very substantial attack and full tone.
 
A third way, not really a subtone, but a way of playing very softly... when a director says, "I want you to play with intensity, as if you are playling loudly, but play very softly."
 
This involves putting the mouthpiece in your mouth at an angle such that you are blowing on one corner of the reed.  The bottom lip is across the reed from its normal position on one side, and to the corner of the reed on the other side.  This is a technique for playing softly with a wide tip opening mouthpiece.

I have MKVI Tenor.  I have several good mouthpieces that have been professionally refaced; guardalas, otto links mainly; each easily subtones down through the instrument.  I recently acquired an otto link without any link markings (i think it is a transitional from florida usa to babbit); original facing; it outplays all the other mouthpieces but for one thing and one thing only; it refuses to subtone on low B. i am hesistant to have it worked on because i love the bit as it is with the critical exception of the low B subtone; could a quirk in the facing curve cause that?? I can&#39;t find it when I measure but I am not a professional refacer. 
 
thanks

Yes, a light once over with 600 or 800 paper, then turn the paper back side up and make several more passes.  There is just enough silicon carbide dust on the back side to put a fine polish on the mouthpiece, whether hard rubber, plastic, or even metal.

Gosh S G, I sure don&#39;t know, haven&#39;t had that problem, just others. For most of the VD mps that I have had, and some students-repair types, I almost always "polish" the table & lay on newspaper, and some with marks/small chips, I reface [lightly] on 600+ SiC paper and polish for [usually] improvement !!  You might try that, but prob. not yet on your best mps !!  Luck, Don
