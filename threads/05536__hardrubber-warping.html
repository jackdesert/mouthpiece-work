            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone know at what temperature a "normal" hard rubber mouthpiece 
would start warping?

Such as if left in a car, or even in direct sunlight in a car?  would 
this generate sufficient temperature to cause the mouthpiece to start 
warping?

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, if left in a car trunk... and that can also damage the sax, corks and such.
   
  Don&#39;t know about direct sunlight.
