            <pre class='message__body'>hello to all,
I have to reface a tenor metal mpc.
It seems very old; it is made in two halves soldered together (brass, no plating)
on its body there is impressed "Precision Crafted      Brooklyn N.Y." and "Made With Pride"; on one side of the shank there is ".107" an on the other there is "313" (or "3/3"???).
Any information about this piece is very appreciated.
thanks in avdance .....e ciao a tutti

have found him to be very congenial in my dealings
with him (I have four of his pieces).

Give him a call or email him. I don&#39;t know the info,
but his website will lead you to the contact info:

Good luck!

            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone tried the Micro Mesh product?

It is abrasive paper that comes in some very high grits.  I collect fountain
pens and use it on pen bodies made from plastic that have gouges or
scratches.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet on any pieces but was curious if anyone
had heard about it.
