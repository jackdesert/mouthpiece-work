            <pre class='message__body'>Are there any videos out there on refacing?
If so, please let me know the source and cost.
If not, is there anyone of you seasoned refacers that would be 
interested in making a video of your work.  Explaining the process 
from start to finish.
I realize that there are many various techniques used and each piece 
must vary slightly in approach and work done.
This site is a very helpfull resource which I am still learning and 
acquiring information from.
Any further information would be appreciated.
Thank You,
Mark Farmer
