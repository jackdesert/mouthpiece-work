If so, please let me know the source and cost.
If not, is there anyone of you seasoned refacers that would be 
interested in making a video of your work.  Explaining the process 
from start to finish.
I realize that there are many various techniques used and each piece 
must vary slightly in approach and work done.
This site is a very helpfull resource which I am still learning and 
acquiring information from.
Any further information would be appreciated.
Thank You,
Mark Farmer
