Thanks Steve for the Tip gauge.  Seems to work great.  The only trick 
was setting the zero point.  Seems that the anvil has uneven edges 
and makes it a bit tricky to know where the flush point is.  This is 
the only thing I would suggest changing as you continue to market 
it.  Im happy to have it and I will be passing on the good news (that 
it works well) to a couple of friends who were interested.  Thanks 
again.

I too want to say thanks to Steve. I am all set up -- assembled and 
zeroed out and measuring but I am such a technical vegetable that I 
don&#39;t know how to read the dial.  I have always used a tip wand in 
the past.  So this my first adventure with dial guage.  At zero The 
little hand is on 9 and the big hand is on 0. When I measure a mpc. 
I know is 107 my dial reads as follows: little hand spins to almost 
to 8 and the big hand reachs 95. What is the tip opening? 
signed, "really stupid."

If I am correct you dont read the little dial.  If you are zeroed out 
then the RED 95 would indicate an opening of .095.  As Steve said, if 
you want to read mouthpieces more open than .100 you will have to 
allow more movement in the second adjustment.  I have mine set back 
to 70 when it is in open position.  If Im not mistaken that would 
permit readings to .130.  Pretty nifty little dials.

One would make only one reading.  For instance: My 7* is a 105.  The 
red reading is simply the .005 behind the 0.  One then assumes the 
full trip around to reach the .100, add the 5 and there is your 105.  
Your top adjustment has to allow for more than one trip around...(1 
and a third is plenty for most).  Keep in mind that in open position 
it has traveled over the course of .100.  If you are only permitting 
it to go from O to O you cant read more than .100.  I hope that makes 
sense, if not perhaps someone more literate than myself can explain 
it better.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just assembled mine.  A realy top-notch job by Steve.  Great design,
fabrication, packaging and instructions.  It works great... if you read the
RED numbers on the dial as the instructions state.

Thanks Steve for the Tip gauge.  Seems to work great.  The only trick 
was setting the zero point.  Seems that the anvil has uneven edges 
and makes it a bit tricky to know where the flush point is.  This is 
the only thing I would suggest changing as you continue to market 
it.  Im happy to have it and I will be passing on the good news (that 
it works well) to a couple of friends who were interested.  Thanks 
again.

No, but thanks.  I ended up using a thick feeler gauge laid across 
the gauge table.  It zeroed out well that way.  The anvils appear 
punched and taper...the feeler took care of the inconsistency.  Great 
tool!

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, got mine in the mail today, and in a few minutes had it set up.  
Checked it against my Winslow, and I get readings within .002", which is 
not a problem, has to do when how I position the Winslow gauge (which is 
as close to the actual tip as possible).  Yours measures farther in.  If 
I move the Winslow gauge to a similar position, I get the same readings.

The brass stop gives a consistent placement of the mouthpiece, and 
consistency is more important than actual numbers.

Excellent product!

Thank YOU!
