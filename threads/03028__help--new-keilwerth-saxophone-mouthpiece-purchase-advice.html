This is my first post to this group so bear with me!

I recently (last August) purchased a new Kewilwerth tenor saxophone.
It&#39;s a SX90R nickel silver model with rolled tone holes. It is
awesome. I love it, but the mouthpiece I was using on my old Beuscher
500 (1979 model) does not respond as well on my new sax. Particularly
in the upper register. I have problems holding high F and F# w/o
really tightening up my embouchure. The mouthpiece I&#39;m currently using
is an old Brilhart. I&#39;m not sure if they were even called Level Air&#39;s
when this one was made, it just says Brilhart on it and is an 8*
facing. I absolutely love it on my Beuscher but it just doesn&#39;t
respond well on my Keilwerth. The low register is fine, altissimo is
even pretty good, but just high notes are a struggle to hold
intonation well. The problem is, I live in a small town in Arkansas
and while there are some music stores, no one has a selection of
mouthpieces for me to try out. Does anyone have this horn (or a
similar one) have any suggestions? I&#39;m looking for something in the
$150 - $300 range. As far as the type of sound I want to have, I don&#39;t
want it to be overly bright as the nickel silver Keilwerths have a
nice pretty round, dark, tone. That&#39;s why I sold the Selmer Jazz metal
and Rovner Deep V8 I had as they sounded awful on it. So I know what
not to buy at this point, but I&#39;m afraid to go and buy something w/o
having some idea of what it sounds like. I play funk, fusion, rock,
jazz, and experimental jam band music. I&#39;d like to have a powerful
tone, but not overly bright and overpowering or growly and nasty. I
prefer to play more pretty most of the time. I would like to be able
to speak freely in the altissimo range though. Oh, and I prefer LaVoz
med-soft reeds. They&#39;ve always treated me well. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Keilwerth horns are a little more difficult (IMHO) to get the upper
range speaking, but just a little. I play both a modern Keilwerth
(Model Ponzol...very similar to SX90R) and a Selmer SA80...the Selmer
is much easier to blow the high end.

If you are &#39;pinching&#39; though, you are just making it harder. I would
recommend that you practice harmonics (i.e. finger low Bb and then
sequentially play low F, Bb2, F2, Bb3, etc while still fingering low
Bb). You will need to &#39;open your throat&#39; and keep your embouchre firm
but tight. Then use the high harmonics embouchre to play the upper
stack and altissimo. It is hard to &#39;pinch out&#39; the high notes on a
Keilwerth...I used to play an early Conn and the issues were the same.

sorry for the double post...I forgot to mention that I have found
large chamber mouthpieces to work quite well...I play a Tenney Link
STM, but if you are interested I have a number of different excellent
large chamber pieces and could probably part with one...contact me
offline.

I guess I don&#39;t understand chambers. I don&#39;t understand how chamber
sizes are numbered and how they affect my playing and my horn&#39;s
response. I&#39;ve never delved into mouthpieces very deeply, just
stumbled upon things I liked and wasted money on things I don&#39;t.
Mostly the latter.

So I&#39;m gathering larger chambers will help me get the tone I have
described, and help "open" the sound up to play regular
(non-altissimo) high range notes more easily? The only numbers on
mouthpieces I am truly familiar with are facings. I&#39;ve always liked
the 8 on my Brilhart so much that&#39;s always what I&#39;ve gone by, but I&#39;ve
noticed some mouthpiece manufacturers use other completely arbitrary
(in appearance to my ignorant eye) numbers for their facing sizes. 

I couldn&#39;t believe how raspy, tinny, harsh, and bright the Rovner Deep
V8 and Selmer metal Jazz were on my nickel silver Keilwerth SX90R as
I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s one of the darkest sounding horns on the new
market today. That Rovner was so agressive it made my whole head feel
as if it were vibrating with the metal in my mouth. It was almost as
if someone were scraping their fingernails on a chalkboard, but in my
head somehow, very uncomfortable and not pretty. Please don&#39;t get me
wrong though, I don&#39;t want a classical Selmer Larry Teal or C* sound,
I just want a flexible jazz mouthpiece that isn&#39;t so powerful and out
of control no matter how delicately I try to play it. That&#39;s been my
experience with everything I&#39;ve played on except for the Brilhart. 

Thanks guys!

            <pre class='message__body'>Berg Larsen numbers the chambers from 0 for the smallest/brightest, to 3 
for the largest.

Their facing sizes are numbered to reflect the tip opening in 
thousandths of an inch.

So, a 100/2 will be a .100" tip opening with the #2 chamber.

Oh okay, the 0 - 3 makes sense. So a 1 and two would be on the medium
small and medium large range respectively. With the tip opening, is
that .100 esentially a 1? like is the 8&#39;s I&#39;m used to playing on a
.800? Didn&#39;t know where these numbers came from, just knew that facing
numbers indicated how much space was between the reed and the
mouthpiece face, and that the higher numbers meant more space and were
"wilder".

Though as many of us have found, Larsen&#39;s marked tip openings are 
often theoretical. ;)

See

http://www.saxgourmet.com/mpfacing.html ... 

For example in a Tenor a 100/3 Berg would be a Meyers
9 or a Link 7 or a Runyon 10 or a Selmer G

There is very little comparison.

            <pre class='message__body'>Unfortunately there is no easy answer to your questions, as everything is to some extent interactive. Tip openings do generally work the same way--the bigger tip openings require softer reeds and tend to be harder to control--but the same tip opening with very different baffle and chamber designs can react quite differently.

Baffles and chambers are also interactive, and they need to be balanced. A very high baffle followed by a very large chamber can be a recipe for disaster in tone and response and intonation. Fortunately manufacturers have done work to make sure there is a reasonable balance, but two similar baffles can sound and respond quite differently if the chambers behind them are different.

And baffle design is also not just a question of low vs. high. The height just behind the tip rail is quite critical, and the slope as it moves towards the chamber, and the length, etc. all change the sound and the response. I have not found that one design is particularly better for altissimos, although each require some adjustment. That being said I have a Runyon Jaguar for alto that has a marked better response in the altis than any of my other pieces, but there is no one single characteristic that seems to be the cause, it appears to just be a good balance of all the variables.

You can very basically think of it like this: the part of the mpc nearest the tip affects the high components of the sound and the back part affects the lower components. The higher the baffle the more the lower harmonics are attenuated, leading to a thinner, brighter sound. The lower the baffle the more the higher harmonics are attenuated, leading to a darker or rounder sound. 

The smaller the chamber the quicker the response, at the expense of "openness" and richness of the sound. Small chambered pieces in my experience tend to feel narrow--not very good for ballads. Too big a chamber, though, and things start to feel spongy and the sax seems to eat its own sound. Chamber size can also have a big effect on intonation, for better or worse--often depending on the horn.

As I say, though, it is important that the baffle and chamber be balanced. Perhaps others can share their thoughts in this area.

Unfortunately the only really good way to find out about all the variables is to actually try different mpcs. Isn&#39;t there some mail-order house that will allow a trial period on mpcs?

  Oh okay, the 0 - 3 makes sense. So a 1 and two would be on the medium
  small and medium large range respectively. With the tip opening, is
  that .100 esentially a 1? like is the 8&#39;s I&#39;m used to playing on a
  .800? Didn&#39;t know where these numbers came from, just knew that facing
  numbers indicated how much space was between the reed and the
  mouthpiece face, and that the higher numbers meant more space and were
  "wilder".

            <pre class='message__body'>The worst facings are Selmer S80 / S90. 

I just did a sax clinic at a university, and as part of that check and 
corrected mouthpiece.  I had to fix EVERY Selmer.  Some old Brilhart 
Ebolins were right on the money, as were some Links. 

The right rail is almost always high on Selmers, and this is what I 
found on these.  Some tables so warped it took me 3-4 sheets of 400 
paper to flatten them..

But after all of that, there were a lot of smiling faces after testing 
their refaced mouthpieces.  Typical comments were, "I had problems with 
low D, low C, I thought it was me or the horn.  But now I can play those 
notes easily."

I don&#39;t mind the tip opening not being "to spec" but it sure looks band 
when a facing is grossly crooked.

            <pre class='message__body'>The tip opening and chambers of Bergs are two different things.  the 0-3 
are chamber sizes.  The two or three digit numbers are tip openings.

There is NO standard of tip opening sizes.  At least Berg pretends that 
a 100 = .100" tip opening, or 85 = .085".

For other manufactures, the numbers are all over the place.  Meyer and 
Runyon alto sax tip openings are very similar, that is, a Meyer 5 is 
about the same as a Runyon 5 ALTO.  Tenors no similarity. 

And for other manufacturers, no similarity whatsoever.  There are no 
"standards".

You must refer to charts, such as the ones in the Woodwind & Brasswind 
catalog, online at www.saxgourmet.com, and others.  A few minutes 
glancing at these charts will tell the tale.

And another thing... these charts are for tip opening only.  Facing 
length also has a big effect.

Short facings require a softer reed, and/or more embouchure pressure 
than medium or long facings.

A short facing with a narrow tip opening will have about the same 
resistance and required embouchure pressure as a long facing with a 
large tip opening. 

Short facings are generally difficult to play in the bottom of the low 
register, but are said to help the high end.  I have found only the 
former to be true, they hurt low notes, but don&#39;t seem to help the high 
notes.

Long facings are generally easy for the low end, but are said to hurt 
the high end.  I have not found this to be true.  I generally reface so 
that soprano mouthpieces are 17mm-18mm long (34-36 on the E.Brand 
scale), alto 21mm-22mm (42-44), tenor 22mm-23mm (44-46) and as long as 
24mm for larger tip openings, bari sax 25 mm (50), and bass sax 
29mm-30mm (58-60).

Not one single customer has complained about his palm key notes or 
altissimo register, and all like the low end response.
