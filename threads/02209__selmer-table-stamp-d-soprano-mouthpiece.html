            <pre class='message__body'>Hello to everyone,

I recently aquired an ORIGINAL table stamp Selmer Soprano in hard 
rubber.  I am just curious.  Does anyone have some numbers for the 
facing curve?  Like a lot of old pieces, it is off a bit.  For 
example, the 15 guage reveals a 32 on the left side and 34 on the 
right, and the 24 isn&#39;t accurate either.  I am not really planning on 
working on this, but would like to know what otheres have found in 
terms of what the proper tip opening and facing curve are.

All my Best,

Bob

            <pre class='message__body'>Bob:  The .0015" should be 32 on the glass gauge (16mm).  But 
truthfully, I have found the Selmer facings to USUALLY be crooked and 
off spec, even on the metals.  It isn&#39;t just a matter of age, it is a 
matter of how they are made... sloppily.

It is worth the effort to rework the facing, and at the same time 
increase the tip opening on the old Soloists, which are usually C*&#39;s.  A 
tip in the .055"-.057" range is far better (E-F) for most players.
