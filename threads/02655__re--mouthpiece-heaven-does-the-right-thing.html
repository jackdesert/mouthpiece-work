            <pre class='message__body'>>>>Fed-ex is the culprit on this one.  They lost the package, and Mr. 
Wanne and I have suffered from their screw-up.  Tough situation � 
who takes the $700+ hit? Mouthpiece Heaven, the customer (myself), 
or Fed-Ex�&lt;&lt;&lt;

Usually, it is the responsibility of the sender to get the goods to the
reciever.  The sender has to deal with the shipper to recover costs, if
they can.
