Perhaps add reeds to that question. 



I play a SR Tech Pro on tenor. I have not found a cane reed that isn&#39;t prone to chirping. 



However, Fibracell reeds work great. 



I haven&#39;t mapped the facing to see if an answer lies there.

            <pre class='message__body'>Okay, but if it can happen mouthpiece where the problem? It would be the tip rail?

Thank you all for your help!

            <pre class='message__body'>Maybe you have a clarinet reed on by mistake (or you just like them) .......and it&#39;s a soprano mouthpiece.
