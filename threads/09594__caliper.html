            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everybody
So I&#39;m searching for calipers and now I notice there are a bunch of them. Can anybody ell me precisely which type of caliper do I need for mpc work? I guess it should be the one that has a sharp "V" shape when totally closed?
Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>I have not compared calipers in detail.  I use a Mitutoyo digital 6" capacity 
caliper which I like a lot.  You need outside and inside "jaws" that are "V" 
shaped but have a slight flat at the point.   It reads to .0005" or .01mm.  


I think many calipers have these features.  If I were to look for a replacement, 
I would probably look for a lower-cost Asian-made caliper.  Micro-Mark has this 
one:

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Harbor Freight also has several digital and analog (dial) calipers. I got a
dial caliper when they had a half-price sale ($20/2 = $10).

            <pre class='message__body'>The Micromark model that Keith mentioned is good.  And it will switch, with the press of the button, from mm to inches, no getting out the calculator and, do I divide or multiply by...?

It is priced as well as any other, and you will get Micromark&#39;s paper catalog in the mail every month.  This is good... searching their site for things they have that you don&#39;t know about, well, you get my drift.  But with the paper catalog I am SURE you will find tools useful for musical instrument and mouthpiece work.  For example, check out this tool:

http://www.micromark.com/TRIP-PIN-BENDING-PLIER-HO-AND-O-SCALE,7521.html

You may see a tool that model railroaders use to bend coupler trip pins.  I see a tool to put a nice non-stress bend in a needle or leaf spring.

Would you have thought to search for that online?  

Besides the caliper Keith mentioned, 

I have this one:

http://www.micromark.com/STAINLESS-STEEL-DIAL-CALIPER-6-CAPACITY,7614.html

and I have this one

http://www.micromark.com/SOLID-BRASS-CALIPER-4-CAPACITY,7555.html 

to measure pad cups for pads.  It gets into small places better, and for measuring for pads, is good enough.
