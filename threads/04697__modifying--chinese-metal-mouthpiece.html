            <pre class='message__body'>Hi All, 
 
I bought a MPC copy of a Selmer silver plated metal but this one has brass termination. It´s really good and easy to work on it. I modified completely trying to make a Guardala chamber and sounds good. I measured about 20 MPC and every one has problems with the table so they has to be rectify. Well, like I tried to copy a Guardala, the inside round edge where the table finishes and the reed start, it´s very thin. I copy that but I dont know what it does on the sound. The MPC finished has great middle sound, big lows but small highs and very difficult play on the over highs notes. With all your expertise, what would made this issue with the high notes?
 
Regards

Asunto: [MouthpieceWork] User review of Ebay Chinese Metal Mouthpiece



Mainly out of curiosity, and also for practice and experimentation, I 
purchased two of the silver-plated metal mouthpieces sold by "Musicalwheel"
on Ebay.

The seller says these are real silver plate and are modeled after Selmer
metal mouthpieces, but not having one to compare it to directly, I can&#39;t say
exactly how close it is as far as chambering etc. Compared to an older HR
Selmer piece, it has similar interior side-walls (straight) and baffle. The
chamber is a straight round bore with no throat constriction. The interior
of the piece is also well-finished, smooth, and plated.

This was a decent-playing tenor piece right out of the box, although not
exactly my cup of tea.

For one thing, it was a somewhat narrower facing than I need, and slightly
narrower than specified. (It was supposed to be 2.5 mm, or .098", but
measured .094").

Very well-finished, with fairly thick silver plate (because I did some
refacing to open it up, and it took a while to get through the silver to the
brass). I used this piece to practice opening up the facing by taking off
the table from the rear.

So far, I haven&#39;t seen any tarnish typical of silver, but it&#39;s still
relatively new, and does have the right soft lustre. If not silver, darn
good imitation.

The rails had some slight assymetry, easily corrected. The facing is a bit
narrower than the Fibracell reeds I use, as is the table, even after having
been widened a bit by the refacing procedure.

All in all, these are a decent buy, at the very least, useful as practice
blanks. The narrowness of the table and facing may be a problem for some
folks. I should add, however, that I also purchased a metal alto mouthpiece
from this seller, and the table and facing are the correct width.

Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>The MPC has 0,115 openning so the reed don´t close off. The notes get thin since the C note of the left hand with the octave key to the altissimo ones. It´s hard to play the F#  because I feel like the note goes high and very metalized. It doesn´t sounds sweet. If you give it more breath the sound brokes and sounds like a bother noise.
Tonight I´ll take it a picture to send you. Thanks for the interest.

Hi Ricardo

I was waiting to see what others would write, but absent a response, I&#39;ll
offer my 2 cents worth:

1) Sometimes a facing that is too long can pinch off the high notes - I&#39;ve
seen this effect recently in some mouthpieces I&#39;ve been working on.

2) Another factor affecting the high notes is that if you&#39;ve opened up the
facing, then the baffle will be too high near the tip rail.

Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>Sounds like the baffle is too high right behind the tip.
