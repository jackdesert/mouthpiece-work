            <pre class='message__body'>I have a new Selmer tenor Soloist H.
 The tip is about a 110, slightly bigger than listed in the charts.
  The lay length is only 40 on the E Brand scale, very short for a mouthpiece this open. All the curve measurements are even on both rails. Does anyone know if  40 is  normal for this mouthpiece or should it be in the 46-50 range as expected?  Thank you.

            <pre class='message__body'>I copied some Selmer specs from a Surreymusic site in the UK in 2002.  I do not know if these are "official" or not.  My spot check measurements indicate that Selmer specifies their tips at the very tip, not inside the tip rail.  Also, their facing lengths seem to be to the table tangent (like a .0000" feeler) not to a .0015" feeler.  They also vary a lot, but that is general trend I have observed.

For a Selmer H, I have the tip at 2.70mm and the facing length at 23mm.   So .106" and 46 mm*2.  But inside the tip rail would be more like .103" and the facing ~45 to the .0015" feeler.  

So your facing sounds extra short.  I think a .110" tip would play a lot better at 48-52 long and a lor resitant facing curve (like a radial one).

            <pre class='message__body'>Thank you.
  That is just what I was thinking of doing. Since I have never encountered a new Soloist before I thought I better ask first.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve got three pre-WWII Selmer metal mouthpieces in my collection (the
"Marcel Mule" mouthpiece) and the chamber looks identical in the pictures.
These are nice classical mouthpieces, and I salute Selmer for addressing
this often neglected market. I look forward to trying one of the latest
examples.

 

I don&#39;t keep up with Selmer&#39;s accessory offerings like I probably
should...will there be a soprano and tenor version?
