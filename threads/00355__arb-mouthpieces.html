            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: ARB Mouthpieces</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>I recently purchased a used Keilwerth saxophone.  In the case was an ARB
8* 7 mouthpiece (arbex).  I have searched the net looking for a store
that sells such a mouthpiece so that I can get some info.  The only info
I have is that the opening is .90 or .95.

I have not been playing for very long.  Can someone educate me?  
Is this a good mouthpiece?  
What are the characteristics of such a mouthpeice? 
Is such a mouthpeice oriented toward Jazz? classical?  
It seems hard for me to play - especially in for the very high D, E,
and F, but seems to help on the very low notes?
What is the approximate value of such a mouthpiece? 
Is there a website that sells ARB mouthpieces?

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>ARB was Arnold Brilhart after selling the Brilhart Plastics company.

You did not state if alto or tenor.  My chart shows ARB 8* for alto as
being .095", for tenor .105".  Their facing sizes were the same as the
Brilhart sizes.

Your mouthpiece is a general playing mouthpiece, not a concert band
mpce, not a full-throttle rock and roll piece, but more big band, combo,
etc.

About $25-$35 for a used one on eBay.

            <pre class='message__body'>The 8* alto, .095" tip opening, the * indicates a short facing.  With
this extremely wide tip opening, for alto players at least, and short
facing, it is likely to be difficult as far as the low register and
fatigue.  Having the facing lengthened will help.

            <pre class='message__body'>I used to play an alto (I&#39;m now a tenor plyer) with a .103" tip gap, 
and I can confirm all of those playing characteristics. I bought it 
when I was young and stupid - for a start it&#39;s a tenor mouthpiece 
(the one I have, that is, not the ARB mouthpiece - the Wolfe Tayne 8* 
I said about a couple of weeks ago). You&#39;re better off going for a 
decent student model mouthpiece, preferably whatever Keilwerth sells 
with them new, as it&#39;s designed for the sax, and the sax is designed 
for the mouthpiece. As you get better, you&#39;re then in a better 
position to start venturing away from the standard factory set-up, 
according to the sound that you want to hear coming out your horn.

Anyway, that&#39;s my 2 cents worth...
