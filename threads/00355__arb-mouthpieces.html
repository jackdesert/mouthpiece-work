            <pre class='message__body'>I recently purchased a used Keilwerth saxophone.  In the case was an ARB
8* 7 mouthpiece (arbex).  I have searched the net looking for a store
that sells such a mouthpiece so that I can get some info.  The only info
I have is that the opening is .90 or .95.

I have not been playing for very long.  Can someone educate me?  
Is this a good mouthpiece?  
What are the characteristics of such a mouthpeice? 
Is such a mouthpeice oriented toward Jazz? classical?  
It seems hard for me to play - especially in for the very high D, E,
and F, but seems to help on the very low notes?
What is the approximate value of such a mouthpiece? 
Is there a website that sells ARB mouthpieces?

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>ARB was Arnold Brilhart after selling the Brilhart Plastics company.

You did not state if alto or tenor.  My chart shows ARB 8* for alto as
being .095", for tenor .105".  Their facing sizes were the same as the
Brilhart sizes.

Your mouthpiece is a general playing mouthpiece, not a concert band
mpce, not a full-throttle rock and roll piece, but more big band, combo,
etc.

            <pre class='message__body'>I used to play an alto (I&#39;m now a tenor plyer) with a .103" tip gap, 
and I can confirm all of those playing characteristics. I bought it 
when I was young and stupid - for a start it&#39;s a tenor mouthpiece 
(the one I have, that is, not the ARB mouthpiece - the Wolfe Tayne 8* 
I said about a couple of weeks ago). You&#39;re better off going for a 
decent student model mouthpiece, preferably whatever Keilwerth sells 
with them new, as it&#39;s designed for the sax, and the sax is designed 
for the mouthpiece. As you get better, you&#39;re then in a better 
position to start venturing away from the standard factory set-up, 
according to the sound that you want to hear coming out your horn.

Anyway, that&#39;s my 2 cents worth...
