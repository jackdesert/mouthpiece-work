            <pre class='message__body'>The link below takes you to an interview I did with my good friend Theo
Wanne in which he talks about his products (not mine) and concepts related
to mouthpiece design. It&#39;s about 12 minutes in length, and quite interesting
IMHO...you don&#39;t have to join any clubs, buy anything, or pay any money to
watch it. It&#39;s a free service from Saxgourmet Products...enjoy!

The Music Business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs. There&#39;s
also a negative side." Hunter S. Thompson
