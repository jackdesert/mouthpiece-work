            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

I took an old piece of hardwood (maple flooring, actually), and fashioned a handled tool with a crooked "finger" at the business end.  This is just the right size to put into the chamber of a clarinet mouthpiece.  I just used a band saw to make the curve.  On that, I put thick double sided tape, which gives me some cushion, and on that, I put sandpaper cut to size.  It works great!  If anyone is intersted, I&#39;ll take a couple of photos and put it up on my website, but it&#39;ll have to wait until I return from the Oklahoma clarinet symposium.  Cheers!

Coarser files (like the tungsten carbide ones from Micro-Mark) or a rotary tool (e.g., Dremel or Foredom) are useful.

When you are finished working the tool & have it the shape that you want it, you can re-harden & temper it. Heat it red hot for an inch , or two back from the tip with the torch, then quench the tip in oil.

            <pre class='message__body'>It IS kind of subjective (may I say VERY subjective).  Just think of a peacock&#39;s tail feather & you will have it.  For our purposes, I don&#39;t think it is that critical.  It&#39;s like the difference in tolerances between 0 & 4 decimal places.  In another life, I used to make a lot of tools by "hammer & hand" and they all seemed to work pretty well.  This will be better than leaving them soft and we don&#39;t need to worry about striking them against steel as a chisel or punch might be.

One can easily make a "reverse" scraper by purchasing an inexpensive
flathead screwdriver and bending the head 90 degrees.  This may require some
heat with a propane torch to soften the metal so it doesn&#39;t snap.  The
reason I recommend a cheap screwdriver is because the metal is typically
much softer to begin with.

 

After your bend, with a grinder, you can narrow the head to whatever
dimension you like, and sharpen the scraper head.  This tool should last for
a month of good use before needs to be sharpened again.  

 

This tool isn&#39;t ideal because it is not Tempered hardened metal which would
keep an edge for a longer time, but it works great when sharp, and it is
inexpensive.  One can easily make a batch of perhaps half a dozen in an
afternoon, and have a good supply.  After several tools have been made, you
can decide which size/s are your personal favorite and then draw a sketch
for your local toolmaker to build a carbide one that would last forever.

 

I use one like this for any "grunt work" necessary, and then I use an
Equaling file, which I have ground the side edges smooth, then glued cork or
leather all the way around to create a somewhat softer, contoured surface
for strips of sandpaper to wrap around.  I am preferring the soft, tacky,
white leather for instrument pads as of late, because two layers glued
together with contact cement creates a nice soft contoured surface and the
tackiness of the leather allows a nice grippy surface for my sandpaper
strips to stay in position during use.  

 

With respect to the sandpaper strips, I simply cut strips that are as wide
as my tool, and are the full length of my sandpaper.  I start with 150 grit,
and move to smoother grades to create the desired surface texture.  This
tool has been one of my longtime favorites for its simplicity, and
functionality.

 

I should mention that for fine work up at the tiprail, I start with rattail
files, and then finish with the above tool.

Coarser files (like the tungsten carbide ones from Micro-Mark) or a rotary
tool (e.g., Dremel or Foredom) are useful.

            <pre class='message__body'>Perhaps a word of caution or warning is in order to a new user of this tool. It seems easily possible to be able to exert too much pressure using this bent screwdriver and break or crack a thin beaked mouthpiece.  There is usually a learning curve with any new tool.
