            <pre class='message__body'>I have a tenor florida Ottolink 7I(t is nickel plated) It is rusted on the table near the window and has corrosion in many points on the side rails (like many marks) where the plate is lost.
1. what is the best way to sand away the rust? (steel wool?)
2. corrosion on the curved part of side rails affects the sound of the piece (they are not perfectly flat where plate is lost) ? If yes, have I to sand away the remaining plate to flatten rails? how?
thanks in advance,
ciao a tutti, Filippo   </pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>This is difficult to give an answer since we can not see the piece.  
I think you can use some steel wool.  But the goal need not be to 
remove all the "rust".  Just make the table flat and properly face 
the rails.  This should clean up most of it so it plays well.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I have a similar problem on my clarinet mouthpiece: eversince I've had it,
there's been a bunch of crap around the area where I put my mouth. Some of it
I can scratch away, and some of it goes away when I apply bore oil, but it
comes right back. I've never seen this on any other mouthpiece. It's a wooden
Selmer clarinet mouthpiece. Is there something wrong with the mouthpiece, or
does it just get to always look like crap?

            <pre class='message__body'>In your case it is probably calcified saliva.  White stuff.  Warm, not hot,
water and soap might work.  Vinegar works great but discolors good hard
rubber.  Wood, plastic and metal pieces can be soaked in a straight or
diluted vinegar-water solution.  For hard rubber, you can dampen a cloth
with vinegar and lightly rub the area.  Rinse it off to minimze discoloration.
