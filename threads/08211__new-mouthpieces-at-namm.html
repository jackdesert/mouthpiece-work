            <pre class='message__body'>I tried to visit all the mouthpiece makers who were exhibiting at NAMM, and
saw some pretty interesting stuff. JodyJazz  had the new Chicago Model DV,
which was very impressive, along with some new CNC machined ring ligatures.
I&#39;ve got an extensive video interview with Jody in which he shows all his
new products at http://saxophonethoughts.blogspot.com if you want to hear
the product descriptions straight from Jody.

 

Theo Wanne had lots of traffic at his booth, and all his mouthpieces were
really jewelry quality and played great.

 

The German company now making Guardala&#39;s displayed their wares, and they
played just like the old ones.

 

The Drake ceramic mouthpieces were most impressive. They play very well and
are beautifully made. This ceramic technology was very interesting to me.
They seem to execute a high quality product very well in an unusual material
very well. They&#39;re very nice folks, as well.

 

I didn&#39;t see anything new at the Babbitt booth that I hadn&#39;t seen before.
Bari showed their multi-material mouthpieces, which are only sorta new, but
still played nicely.

 

A Japanese company, Projection, had some nicely made hard rubber pieces,
very high quality.

 

Numerous Chinese and Taiwanese companies showed a wide assortment of
products, most of which lacked flat tables or well formed tips. They were
better than the products I was shown last year, so they are figuring it out.
A couple of the companies almost had it right, and they were very
inexpensive.

 

Once again, I was privately shown some Guardala copies that were dead
ringers for the real thing (although not labeled Guardala). They had three
different models, all of which seemed to be exact copies of a Super King, a
Brecker, and a Crescent. I was told they had been exactly copied using point
cloud technology and then CNC machined. They looked and played great. If
they had the original engraving and bite plate, I don&#39;t believe I could have
been able to tell the difference between them and the genuine article.

 

There was a lot of buzz about a new ligature Rico is offering, which looks
very much like a Harrison. I didn&#39;t try one, but quite a few people had
bought them and were singing their praises.

 

I didn&#39;t see Peter Ponzol or Gary Sugal, both of whom are usually at the
show. I can only assume they were not there. Oleg Garbozov was showing the
same products as last year.

 

Quite a few of the Asian manufacturers expressed some interest  to me about
getting into the mouthpiece and neck business. A couple of them have good
products now. Most are still not quite where they ought to be, but get
better every time I see new examples. Their prices are about 1/5th what you
would pay in the USA, and all they have to do is get their tooling and
machine settings straightened out and they will have products as good as
any. I&#39;m going to do some consulting work for a couple of those factories to
help them resolve their quality issues. Most of the student level
mouthpieces they are making now are pretty good (or at least as good as you
can get anywhere else) and they want to move into the upscale market. A
couple of them had some interesting cosmetic touches on their metal pieces,
and they all seem to have carefully studied the classic basic designs that
have been around for years and are familiar with some of the different ideas
that have been introduced in recent times. You better watch out: these guys
now own the saxophone market, and are coming after the accessory market.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree…you can buy very high quality Asian blanks for less than $20 each if
you buy by the hundred, with metal cap and ligature…..they play pretty well
right out of the box, even better if you tweak them just a bit…..they’ve got
every reasonable style you could want……they will also make anything you want
if you order in sufficient quantity…….
