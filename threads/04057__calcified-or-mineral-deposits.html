            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve found that a spray product called "Kaboom" works wonders to get rid of the white 
deposits.  Spray some on the mouthpiece and let sit for a while or fill a small container to let 
the parts of the mouthpiece with the depsosits to soak for really stubborn deposits.  It&#39;s safe 
for any type of mouthpiece whether plastic, hard rubber or metal.

            <pre class='message__body'>Kaboom worked great at removing the calcified crud.  Putting a little on 
a cotton swab took care of the less stubborn areas as well.  Thanks, guys.
