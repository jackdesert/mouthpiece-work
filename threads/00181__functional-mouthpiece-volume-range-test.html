            <pre class='message__body'>The initial testing is completed with results exactly as expected.  I&#39;ll be posting the study in the next couple of days.  Here&#39;s a preview:

This study shows that what A. Benade terms as the "Effective Mouthpiece Volume", of a saxophone mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube*, is actually the exact average of the actual phase-dependent, "reed open" and "reed closed" volumes of the mouthpiece, for each cycle of the waveform.  Awareness of the maximum and minimum volume values establishes the range within which the mouthpiece functions normally.  One would think that Benade&#39;s averaging would be sufficiently accurate to enable the conscientious tech or player to effectively match a mouthpiece to a saxophone, however, once we see that the actual volume of the mouthpiece is at any one time reed phase dependent, and we compare the reed phase characteristics of cylindrical air columns with those of conical air columns, it becomes clear that Benade&#39;s Effective Mouthpiece Volume, calculated on a cylindrical tube, does not transfer effectively to the conical saxophone without some compensation and
 consideration for saxophone size, design, and playing style.

Part I describes the initial test procedure and it&#39;s results.  Part II deals with the differences between cylindrical and conical air columns and reed cycles and how to best match a saxophone&#39;s missing cone volume and Frs requirements with a mouthpiece&#39;s Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range and Frs, for the various saxophone sizes, designs, and types of playing.  A simplified and supremely accurate Frs method is explained.

            <pre class='message__body'>You are to be complimented for the amount of time and effort that went
into your study Lance.  Now that I have had some time to study what you
have done, I would like to offer a couple of friendly suggestions.

1. Think about the equivalent mouthpiece volume of the saxophone when
played at softer levels when the reed does not close completely and how
that ties in with your theory that the closed and open volumes are
"averaged" to give the equivalent volume and therefore the pitch.

2. Have a closer look at the relationship between the equivalent volume
inside the mouthpiece and the ratio between the opening and closing time
of the reed.

3. Look at the possibility that Benade made a mistake in his class notes
and the Frs of the mouthpiece + neck should have been given as the 1st
mode of the shortest tube used---not the second.  This would agree with
the actual played pitch of the alto neck at its written F2, and the
played pitch of the tenor sax mouthpiece and neck at its written F#2.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Steve,

Here is the thing: we know that the sax tunes basically not only by length, but by how well the mpc mimics the missing end of the cone, which is cut off at the end of the neck to have a place to put the mpc/reed so you can actually blow the thing.

Basically, when you push the mpc onto the cork, it reduces the volume inside the mpc (the neck sticks further in) and this raises the pitch, and vice-versa. The trouble is that this doesn&#39;t raise the pitch equally--higher notes get more sharp than lower notes. This means that really, for optimum
 intonation between registers, there is only one ideal position of the mpc on the cork, but depending on other factors, such as temperature and embouchure and certain reed characteristics (and of course the design of the horn itself), this may or may not be when the horn is playing in the correct
 pitch.

Further, even if everything is perfect, bands tune to different versions of A. So while it is absolutely convenient to be able to move the mpc on the neck to tune the horn based on all these conditions, it can throw the octaves out, or make the palms crazy sharp (or sometimes flat).

But what if you could change the length of the horn without changing the inside volume of the mpc? Benade says (referring to oboes) that reducing the volume inside the reed raises pitch, but not equally in the registers, while shortening the reed raises pitch pretty much equally across the entire
 range of the horn. 

Unfortunately, this is not easy to do with a sax. With an oboe you can just use a shorter staple, which is analogous to using a shorter neck on a sax, but how many people carry necks of different sizes? But aha! The Conn microtuner actually acts as a variable-length neck. The mpc is pushed
 completely on the cork, and the microtuner varies the length of the neck pipe.

So here is the perfect way to test the idifference between moving the mpc on the cork and changing the length of the neck while not varying the internal volume of the mpc, as it relates to intonation.

This is difficult to get precise without the use of a stable (probably artificial) embouchure. But what would be interesting is to do this:

1. Push the mpc completely on the cork, and then blow the horn with the microtuner at its shortest and longest position. Find out how well the registers are in relation and the pitch in three octaves. Blow, say, C1-C2-C3 through F1-F2-F3. If Benade is correct (or if I am correct in assuming that
 this can be applied to the sax), those three octave notes should be somewhat true octaves, no matter whether the microtuner is completely extended and the horn plays its flattest, or completely retracted and the horn plays its sharpest.

2. Now put the microtuner at its shortest and instead reproduce the pitch played with the microtuner at its longest by pulling the mpc off the cork like a normal sax. It is not necessary to get it exactly the same length, just pull it off until the middle octave is playing the same pitch as it was
 with the mpc fully on the cork with the microtuner out all the way.

3. Play those same octave jumps as before now and check and see how the octaves play. Theory would say that the octaves should be narrowed, meaning that the upper notes should play flatter than they did just using the microtuner.

The microtuner thus gives us a very good way of checking the difference between tuning by changing mpc volume (and length to a smaller extent) against tuning solely by changing the length of the air column.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks John,

I&#39;ve been planning to upate and expand the study.   Of course, low dynamic playing, where the reed does not close, the volumes will be different.  Also, during the time the reed is open, it is constantly moving.  The "reed open" volume that I obtained from the "reed closed" and the EMV average, is actually the AVERAGE volume of the reed open phase.  So the actual "reed open" volume fluctuates between almost closed to 5.68 ml over, the given "reed open" volume - so a much wider range.  Crazy.

You are to be complimented for the amount of time and effort that went into your study Lance.  Now that I have had some time to study what you have done, I would like to offer a couple of friendly suggestions.

1. Think about the equivalent mouthpiece volume of the saxophone when played at softer levels when the reed does not close completely and how that ties in with your theory that the closed and open volumes are "averaged" to give the equivalent volume and therefore the pitch.

2. Have a closer look at the relationship between the equivalent volume inside the mouthpiece and the ratio between the opening and closing time of the reed.

3. Look at the possibility that Benade made a mistake in his class notes and the Frs of the mouthpiece + neck should have been given as the 1st mode of the shortest tube used---not the second.  This would agree with the actual played pitch of the alto neck at its written F2, and the played pitch of the tenor sax mouthpiece and neck at its written F#2.

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t think you understand the point I am trying to get across.  If
the effective mouthpiece volume when the reed is being closed completely
is an average of the mouthpiece open volume and the mouthpiece closed
volume, then it is that volume which determines the length of the cone
the wave "sees" and determines its pitch.

Under your theory, when the reed does not have a closed cycle at softer
levels, no averaging takes place, and the mouthpiece volume is
determined by just the reed open phase.  That would mean that at softer
levels of playing the volume is larger creating a pitch that is lower,
and then when the dynamic level rises to where the reed closes each
cycle, the mouthpiece equivalent volume suddenly drops to the
"average"causing the pitch to suddenly go higher.  In actual playing
this does not happen during a crescendo, and the reverse does not happen
during a diminuendo.  There is never a sudden change in pitch going in
and out of the closed reed cycle,  although there is a perceptible
change in timbre.

How do you explain this under your "theory"?

It is important to remember that the mouthpiece "effective volume" is
what the sound wave "sees" as the length of the missing cone to its
apex, and that it is this virtual length that determines the pitch of
each note.  I don&#39;t see how that volume and length can keep changing
throughout its range as you assert and allow a saxophone to be played in
tune.

Again, the equivalent volume of the mouthpiece is not a function of the
ratio of the amount of time the reed is open or closed.  Those are two
completely different physical aspects of the workings of the mouthpiece
and reed.  Remember that it is the missing cone of the saxophone, not
its missing array of cones of different sizes for different notes and
dynamic levels. It is difficult enough already to try to match one
mouthpiece equivalent volume to that of the missing cone, and now you
are trying to say there are dozens of different mouthpiece equivalent
volumes.

the effective mouthpiece volume when the reed is being closed completely
 is an average of the mouthpiece open volume and the mouthpiece

Benade&#39;s Effective Mouthpiece Volume does not exist within the waveform cycle as it is only the product of the 2 phases of a completed cycle.  During the cycle, the actual volume of the "reed closed" phase is what it is.  That static minimal volume determines the length of the tube for the time it takes the wave to go two entire lengths (cylindrical), or (conical) for the length of time it takes the mouthpiece + constriction resonance, to go from the truncation, to the theoretical apex, and back, and all tube resonances react accordingly.  Because of the additive nature of the cycle and the way we perceive pitch, the parts of the cycle are added together and divided by the duration.  The end perception of a completed cycle does not change the actual reality of what happens within the cycle.  One thing is not the other.

As I just posted earlier, I have to update the study.  In any "reed open" phase, the reed is moving all over the place, and what we calculate as "reed open" volume in the EMV test is actually the average of all the "reed open" volumes within that phase of the cycle.  Only the "reed closed" volume is static  The EMV volume of a completed cycle then, is the average of the "reed open" volumes, averaged with itself and the static "reed closed" volume.  As the "reed open" volume is always being averaged our perception of the completed cycle, the pitch does not change.

Sorry.  Again, the sound wave and tube resonances do not perceive themselves as we perceive them.  They exist in the moment, determined by the actual volume of the mouthpiece in that segment of time (within the range of the speed of sound).  EMV is a result of a completed cycle, not the cycles individual components.

"Again,
 the equivalent volume of the mouthpiece is not a function of the ratio 
of the amount of time the reed is open or closed."

Be aware that Benade did not include time domain considerations in his method, however, they exist non-the-less, and are certainly worth considering, if an accurate picture of what is going on is important.

"It is difficult enough already to try to match one 
mouthpiece equivalent volume to that of the missing cone, and now you 
are trying to say there are dozens of different mouthpiece equivalent 
volumes."

Benade&#39;s method does not consider time nor what happens within each cycle.  I choose not to limit myself to that degree.  If you understand everything that is going on, you realize that while the missing cone is a set volume, the mouthpiece can only offer a shifting compromise, but, with that understanding the application of that shifting compromise can be realized optimally for any given situation.

Exactly what do these statements mean Lance?   "The mouthpiece +
constriction resonance". "That all tube resonances react accordingly".  
As often is the case, after you have answered my questions I am more
confused than I was before I asked them.

Only the "reed closed" volume is static  The EMV volume of a completed
cycle then, is the average of the "reed open" volumes, averaged with
itself and the static "reed closed" volume.  As the "reed open" volume
is always being averaged our perception of the completed cycle, the
pitch does not change.

This fails to address the issue that I raised that as the mouthpiece
equivalent volume goes from the value of the average of the open and
closed volumes (even if the open volume is itself an average) to the
constant open volume there will be an abrupt change in the mouthpiece
equivalent volume which in turn will create an abrupt change in the
pitch.  The following chain of relationships should be taken into
account and not be ignored in this discussion.

Mouthpiece equivalent volume ---volume of missing cone---length of
missing cone---wavelength of note---pitch of note

Benade&#39;s method does not consider time nor what happens within each
cycle.  I choose not to limit myself to that degree.  If you understand
everything that is going on, you realize that while the missing cone is
a set volume, the mouthpiece can only offer a shifting compromise, but,
with that understanding the application of that shifting compromise can
be realized optimally for any given situation.

Even if you are correct in your first (as yet unproven) assumption that
the MEV as you call it is the result of averaging what takes place in
the time domain of parts of the wave&#39;s cycle your second assumption that
the MEV is dependent upon the ratio of the opening and closing time of
the reed is completely false.

It is true that the ratio between the closing and opening time of the
reed is equal to the ratio of the truncation (length of missing cone) to
the tube length (to the first open tonehole).  What you are missing
completely is the fact that it is the length of the tube past the end of
the neck that is changing to alter the ratio of truncation---not the
length/volume of the missing cone or its substitution.  That
length/volume (of the mouthpiece substitution) is quite constant over a
considerable fraction of an instrument&#39;s playing range.  Benade FMA p.
467.

 what do these statements mean Lance?   "The mouthpiece + 
constriction resonance". "That all tube resonances react accordingly""

I find it more and more difficult to take you seriously John.  How can you pretend, after all the discussion and references in this forum alone, in which you have actively taken part, that you don&#39;t know what the resonance of the mouthpiece + constriction is.  Shall I quote you in previous posts referring to it knowingly?  Further, you know very well that tube resonances react to changes in tube dimensions.  I have no time or energy to waste on your intentionally diversionary dramaticism.  If you continue in this fashion, I will just delete your posts without reading them.

"Only the "reed 
closed" volume is static  The EMV volume of a completed cycle then, is 
the average of the "reed open" volumes, averaged with itself and the 
static "reed closed" volume.  As the "reed open" volume is always being 
averaged our perception of the completed cycle, the pitch does not 
change.  

This fails to address the issue that I 
raised that as the mouthpiece equivalent volume goes from the value of 
the average of the open and closed volumes (even if the open volume is 
itself an average) to the constant open volume there will be an abrupt 
change in the mouthpiece equivalent volume which in turn will create an 
abrupt change in the pitch."

You are not thinking. Once the reed starts to close and the minimal volume becomes static, any increase in dynamic level will cause a gradual, dynamic-dependent increase in the "reed open" average within the cycle, and the additive nature of the cycle and our perception, will reduce the effect of any gradual increase by 1/2.   The effect of shifting harmonic resonance peaks within the regime will affect intonation as well.  Regardless, a slight flattening pitch shift is characteristic of louder dynamic level playing, other factors remaining constant.  A weak reed plays flatter than a stiff reed for the same reason.  

"Even if you are 
correct in your first (as yet unproven) assumption "

The theory is proven, by the 100%, universally valid, algebraic formula which applies, and substantiated by the indisputable results of my test.  I invite you AGAIN to disprove the algebraic formula, or show that it does not apply, or to prove my test invalid.  I doubt that you will try, as to do so, you will have to then acknowledge my results and logic.  You prefer to blatantly 
disregard the facts altogether or to play "confused".   

"...your second assumption that
 the MEV is dependent upon the ratio of the opening and closing time of 
the reed is completely false."

I reject your semantic fabrication.  I made no such assumption.  Benade&#39;s MEV is strictly based upon the average of the extreme volumes within the cycle.  As I clearly stated in my last post, Benade does not include time domain considerations.  My analysis does, as I consider them important.

"It is true that the ratio between the closing 
and opening time of the reed is equal to the ratio of the truncation 
(length of missing cone) to the tube length (to the first open 
tonehole).  What you are missing completely is the fact that it is the 
length of the tube past the end of the neck that is changing to alter 
the ratio of truncation-- -not the length/volume of the missing cone or 
its substitution."

Again, this is your fabrication.  I stated no such thing.  The resonance of the mouthpiece + constriction, which determines the truncation ratio when compared to the changing tube length, remains constant, as it exists only in the "reed closed" phase, during which the mouthpiece volume is static (the reed actually flexes inward, into the chamber some, but we&#39;ll disregard that for now).

You are 0 for 5 there.

            <pre class='message__body'>Why is knowing the Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range important, if we already know Benade&#39;s Equivalent Mouthpiece Volume?

Because, it is at the extreme volumes of each phase within the wave-form&#39;s cycle, that the effects of too much or too little volume will first become apparent.  It is there that the regime will break down, long before the effects of the average EMV cause any difficulty at all. 

Why are time domain considerations important?  It&#39;s just me, but I&#39;d rather my mouthpiece/reed combination functioned with the horn fantastically for 85% of the time, and OK 15% of the time, as opposed to just average for 50% of the time and average for the other 50%.   If I play bari or bass sax, I&#39;m probably going to me more concerned about how my horn responds in the low end than at the high end, and here time domain considerations will make a big difference, whereas Benade&#39;s EMV tells you nothing.

Exactly what do these statements mean Lance?   "The mouthpiece + constriction resonance". "That all tube resonances react accordingly".   As often is the case, after you have answered my questions I am more confused than I was before I asked them.

Only the "reed closed" volume is static  The EMV volume of a completed cycle then, is the average of the "reed open" volumes, averaged with itself and the static "reed closed" volume.  As the "reed open" volume is always being averaged our perception of the completed cycle, the pitch does not

This fails to address the issue that I raised that as the mouthpiece equivalent volume goes from the value of the average of the open and closed volumes (even if the open volume is itself an average) to the constant open volume there will be an abrupt change in the mouthpiece equivalent volume
 which in turn will create an abrupt change in the pitch.  The following chain of relationships should be taken into account and not be ignored in this discussion.

Mouthpiece equivalent volume ---volume of missing cone---length of missing cone---wavelength of note---pitch of note

Benade&#39;s method does not consider time nor what happens within each cycle.  I choose not to limit myself to that degree.  If you understand everything that is going on, you realize that while the missing cone is a set volume, the mouthpiece can only offer a shifting compromise, but, with that
 understanding the application of that shifting compromise can be realized optimally for any given situation.

Even if you are correct in your first (as yet unproven) assumption that the MEV as you call it is the result of averaging what takes place in the time domain of parts of the wave&#39;s cycle your second assumption that the MEV is dependent upon the ratio of the opening and closing time of the reed is
 completely false.

It is true that the ratio between the closing and opening time of the reed is equal to the ratio of the truncation (length of missing cone) to the tube length (to the first open tonehole).  What you are missing completely is the fact that it is the length of the tube past the end of the neck that
 is changing to alter the ratio of truncation---not the length/volume of the missing cone or its substitution.  That length/volume (of the mouthpiece substitution) is quite constant over a considerable fraction of an instrument&#39;s playing range.  Benade FMA p. 467.

During the cycle, the actual volume of the "reed closed" phase is what it is.  That static minimal volume determines the length of the tube for the time
 it takes the wave to go two entire lengths (cylindrical), or (conical) for the length of time it takes the mouthpiece + constriction resonance, to go from the truncation, to the theoretical apex, and back, and all tube resonances react accordingly.  Because of the additive nature of the cycle and
 the way we perceive pitch, the parts of the cycle are added together and divided by the duration.  The end perception of a completed cycle does not change the actual reality of what happens within the cycle.  One thing is not the other.

            <pre class='message__body'>Here&#39;s an interesting tidbit from an early engineering report of Benade&#39;s for Conn:

The simplest glance at the impedance equation of a resonant system shows that raising the natural frequency increases the magnitude of the apparent stiffness when it is measured below the resonant frequency. This leads to the consequence that raising the frequency of the isolated reed gives rise
 to a sharpening of the pitch of the reed-pipe system, but only asymptotically toward the natural frequency of the pipe alone. From this we see that the properties (such as uniformity of scale, etc.) of the bore of a woodwind, and of its holes may best be studied in the laboratory by asking the
 player to play as sharp as possible, so as to give the pipe the most possible control over the frequency, and to minimize the extent to which the player&#39;s own ear and habits can affect his results. The proper tuning desired from an instrument can then be determined with the help of an auxiliary
 set of experiments which show how much flatter than the highest possible pitch a player prefers to play in order to get a good tone and comfortable embouchure

time or energy to waste on your intentionally diversionary dramaticism. 
If you continue in this fashion, I will just delete your posts without
reading them".

In the interest of clarity, I am going to address each issue in a
separate post.  The first issue is the purpose of my question.  Rather
than "intentionally diversionary dramaticism" as you claim it is an
earnest attempt to understand the meaning of your statement.  You wrote
in an earlier post.

That static minimal volume determines the length of the tube for the
time it takes the wave to go two entire lengths (cylindrical), or
(conical) for the length of time it takes the mouthpiece + constriction
resonance, to go from the truncation, to the theoretical apex, and back,
and all tube resonances react accordingly.

The confusion arises out of the use of the term "mouthpiece +
constriction".  As used by Benade throughout his writings this means the
mouthpiece + the neck.  This way this term is defined affects not only
the point of truncation but  the frequency of the mouthpiece +
constriction resonance as well.

The second part of your statement that is not clear is the second
highlighted statement that "all tube resonances react accordingly".  I
presume that this means the "tube resonances" of a given note "react" to
the shortened tube created by the closing of the reed for the duration
of the cycle that the reed remains closed.

The purpose of this question can best be demonstrated using the
measurements and computations from my
missing cone volume comparison study
&lt;http://jbtsaxmusic.homestead.com/Missing_Cone_Volume_Comparison_Study-R&#92;
evised.pdf>   so please bear with me.

                                      Length          Volume
Missing cone               213.7 mm      8.88 ml
Mouthpiece closed*   105.2 mm     6.87 ml
Difference                    108.5 mm     2.01 ml

*  The mouthpiece closed volume is its measured geometric volume minus
the volume displaced by the the neck.  The length of the "missing cone"
represented by that closed volume is calculated from the volume and the
radius of the mouthpiece shank 7.9 mm using the formula  L = 3V/pi r2

When the written F#1 is sounded on the alto saxophone, at s.s. 345 m/s
the frequency is 220 hz, and the wavelength is 1570 mm.  Since the
wavelength = 2L (twice the length of the instrument)  L = 785 mm

For the duration of the cycle that the mouthpiece is closed at louder
playing levels, the mouthpiece volume
is reduced to 6.87 ml,  and the length of the "missing cone" represented
by that volume is shortened by 108.5 mm.

That means for the duration of the cycle that the mouthpiece is closed
while playing F#1, the tube length of 785 mm is shortened by 108.5 mm 
to 676.5 mm.  Multiplying that by 2 we get the wavelength of 1353.mm.
which falls somewhere between written A1 (1320 mm) and G#1 (1400 mm).

The duration of each cycle that the reed is closed on a conical
instrument is equal to the ratio of the truncation (length of missing
cone) to the length of the tube (from the first open tonehole) to the
apex.  In the case of F#1, the length of the ideal missing cone is 213.7
mm and the length of the tube is 785 mm.
Dividing 213.7 by 785 gives  .27 or 27%.

The period for one cycle is the reciprocal of the frequency, so 1 cycle
at 220 hz is 1/220 second or .0045 second.   Since the reed is closed
for 27% of that time period multiplying .0045 second by .27 we get
.0012 second.

So there won&#39;t be any further misunderstanding, my question has been
rephrased to this:

"For the .0012 second that the reed is closed during the cycle playing
F#1 on the alto sax that causes the pitch for that duration to rise by
almost a minor third, what are the reactions of the "tube resonances"
that "act accordingly".

An important corollary question would be:  "What is the significance, if
any, of these reactions of the tube resonances in the thousandth of a
second of the time domain we are discussing"?

Tomorrow I will address the second issue which is the proof and
mathematics in your study that produces what you call your "indisputable
results".

Till then. . .

Besides the fact that Benade contradicts himself on this, as has already been discussed to death, not even once, in any of his writings, does he address the issue of this resonance causing the reed to re-open on a conical instrument, and the ever-changing tube length/truncation length, dependent truncation ratio.  All of this material has been made perfectly clear, by explanations, quotes and links to more recent studies by Nederveen, Kergorand and Rockaboy, Dalmont, and Fletcher, all provided on both mouthpiecework forums.  I can quote you commenting on this material if you like.  Benade has nothing to do with it.  Your glossary is severely limited.

First of all, your conception of the reed cycle of a saxophone is totally wrong, so all your calculations are wrong, as are any conclusions.   The sounding F#1 wave-length
 is 1570mm long, or a cycle of two lengths of the tube.  The reed closes only once per cycle, during the 1st half of the second length.  Your calculations are for 2 reed closures (2 * 676.5) per cycle.  That&#39;s wrong.

I&#39;ll address the rest in my next post.







 Your sounding F#1 wave-length is 1570mm long.

Toby,

During each cycle of f1, there are two cycles of f2, three cycles of f3 and four cycles of f4. As you know, integral alignment is necessary for optimal results of the regime, and the results come at the completion of the cycle, when everything gets added up and averaged by time.  The shorter resonance wave-lengths are affected more by immediate and actual deviation from the missing cone equivalent mouthpiece volume than that of f1.......do I really have to go on?

            <pre class='message__body'>1. Benade does not contradict himself in the use of Frs or the term
mouthpiece + constriction to mean the mouthpiece plus the neck for the
saxophone.  It is your misuse of the term which makes the communication
of your ideas difficult to understand.

  On page 21 of Acoustical Evolution of Wind Instruments he shows a rough
drawing of the "cavity plus constriction" with the constriction drawn as
a tube extending from the "cavity" and below that the text indicates
that the "constriction" is the sax neck.  When he says that the Frs or
resonant frequency of the cavity plus constriction is the 2nd mode
frequency of the shortest used tube (all the palm keys open) it should
read the 1st mode frequency of that note without the octave key.  The
resonant frequency of the alto sax mouthpiece and neck is its written F2
which is close to this frequency, and the resonant frequency of the
tenor sax mouthpiece on its neck is its written F#2 also close to this
frequency.  Neither of these produce the 2nd mode of that pitch which is
an octave higher.  Benade has never referred to the mouthpiece plus
constriction as the mouthpiece alone with a dimensionless ring inserted
in the shank of the mouthpiece where the end of the neck would be as you
define the term.  In fact, the only way to make that apparatus useful
for acoustic measurements would be to chop off the end at the point of
the "constriction" as you define it.

It would be very difficult to accurately ascertain the resonant
frequency of a mouthpiece alone even if it weren&#39;t cut off due to the
fact that without the resonant frequency of an attached tube of some
length to couple with the reed&#39;s vibrations, the played pitch can be set
over a wide range of notes with just the slightest embouchure and/or
throat change.

2.  Obviously you do not understand the simple and clear mathematics I
laid out in my response.  You are mistaken.  My results were accurate.  
Please go through the calculations yourself to see that they are in fact
correct.  Please check your own work before calling someone else wrong
in the future.

3.  Both of your responses were  nothing more than attempts to evade the
straightforward questions put to you by changing or obscuring the topic.
Your effort to evade the questions themselves, speaks louder than any
other response you might have offered.

tomorrow I will discuss the proof contained in your study . . .

I repeat. You are wrong.  The reed is closed only during the first part of the second tube length.  Not for both lengths.  You are subtracting the 108.5mm from the total wave-length twice.

Benade:  His text - "second mode of the shortest tube used" is correct, as per Nederveen, Kergorand,  Rockaboy, Dalmont, Fletcher Wolfe.  Only Talcott disagrees, and I discount that completely.

I get into this, as it appears you are trying to say that .0012 seconds
is an insignificant amount of time.Â  Keep in mind that the entire
cycle, is only .0045 second, and the reed open part only .0033
second.Â  If you played an F#1 long tone for 20 seconds, the reed
would be closed a total of 5.4 seconds.Â  Is that a significant
amount of time?

OK.  If the cycle is .0045 seconds long, then the f2 cycle is once every .00225 seconds, the f3 cycle is once every .0015 seconds, and the f4 cycle is once every .001125 seconds.  Surely the .0045 f1 cycle is important.  Are the harmonic resonances which make up the regime then unimportant, because they their individual cycles are less than f1, and only a thousandth of a second or two?

I repeat. You are wrong.  The reed is closed only during the first part

Ok Lance.  During the portion of the wave that the reed is closed what
is the length of the tube, and  what  wavelength/pitch does that
represent?  Please don&#39;t evade the question, and show your work
(calculations) this time.  This "resonance" of the closed reed segment
of the wave cycle was included in your original statement along with its
effect upon the resonances of the tube, so don&#39;t tell me it can&#39;t be
computed.

Benade:  His text - "second mode of the shortest tube used" is correct,
as per Nederveen, Kergorand,  Rockaboy, Dalmont, Fletcher Wolfe.  Only
Talcott disagrees, and I discount that completely.

Come on Lance.  That doesn&#39;t even make sense.   You are saying in effect
that the dozens of times Benade unequivocally refers to the Frs or the
mouthpiece + constriction as the mouthpiece plus the neck in both FMA
and in his class notes are suddenly negated because he said "second
mode" of the shortest tube used by mistake.  Simple logic and reason
tells us that is absurd---especially when one plays the alto saxophone
mouthpiece on its neck and sounds the first mode frequency of the
shortest used tube---a crappy sounding F2 (palm keys open without the
octave key) not an F3!

If you are going to cite names, give me just one reference by any of
those authors that says that the mouthpiece + constriction or the Frs
refers to the mouthpiece alone as you assert.

Cross reference the paragraph marked (2) on page 21 of Evolution of Wind
Instruments with the numbered statement 7 and the paragraph that follows
in FMA page470.  You will see that Benade is saying the same thing in
both cases.

 It occurs to me that if either of you has a Conn with functioning microtuner, you can easily test the effect of lengthening the air column without changing the inner volume of the mpc.

I&#39;ll give you a chance to withdraw or re-phrase your question, before I get into this, as it appears you are trying to say that .0012 seconds is an insignificant amount of time.  Keep in mind that the entire cycle, is only .0045 second, and the reed open part only .0033 second.  If you played an
 F#1 long tone for 20 seconds, the reed would be closed a total of 5.4 seconds.  Is that a significant amount of time?

My point is that, given the difference between reed-open and reed-closed volume is fixed, what difference does it make? EVERY work I have read says that there are two and only two conditions which need to be met to get a reasonably good match--Veff and Frs. You also seem to totally ignore the fact
 that when F1 is present, all the other partials have to follow in lock-step.

Toby,

During each cycle of f1, there are two cycles of f2, three cycles of f3 and four cycles of f4. As you know, integral alignment is necessary for optimal results of the regime, and the results come at the completion of the cycle, when everything gets added up and averaged by time.  The shorter
 resonance wave-lengths are affected more by immediate and actual deviation from the missing cone equivalent mouthpiece volume than that of f1.......do I really have to go on?

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

You are back to your old misconception of mode locking again.  Why?  Did you forget?  Mode locking does not cause resonances to shift at all.  If they are misaligned they are misaligned and they stay that way.  Mode locking causes the regime to shift the frequency at which it forms (and thus the integral fn frequencies), to that point within the half-amplitude bandwidths of the concerned resonances, which provides the most acoustical energy.  The resonances themselves remain unchanged.  The further a resonance&#39;s peak is from integral, the less energy it contributes.  If the integral frequency lies outside the half-amplitude bandwidth of the resonance, the resonance can not participate.  

I&#39;ll repeat my earlier post: 

Why is knowing the Functional 
Mouthpiece Volume Range important, if we already know Benade&#39;s 
Equivalent Mouthpiece Volume?

Because, it is at the extreme 
volumes of each phase within the wave-form&#39;s cycle, that the effects of 
too much or too little volume will first become apparent.  It is there 
that the regime will break down, long before the effects of the average 
EMV cause any difficulty at all. 

Why are time domain 
considerations important?  It&#39;s just me, but I&#39;d rather my 
mouthpiece/reed combination functioned with the horn fantastically for 
85% of the time, and OK 15% of the time, as opposed to just average for 
50% of the time and average for the other 50%.   If I play bari or bass 
sax, I&#39;m probably going to me more concerned about how my horn responds 
in the low end than at the high end, and here time domain
 considerations will make a big difference, whereas Benade&#39;s EMV tells 
you nothing.

      Lance,



My point is that, given the difference between reed-open and reed-closed volume is fixed, what difference does it make? EVERY work I have read says that there are two and only two conditions which need to be met to get a reasonably good match--Veff and Frs. You also seem to totally ignore the fact
 that when F1 is present, all the other partials have to follow in lock-step.

Toby,



During each cycle of f1, there are two cycles of f2, three cycles of f3 and four cycles of f4. As you know, integral alignment is necessary for optimal results of the regime, and the results come at the completion of the cycle, when everything gets added up and averaged by time.  The shorter
 resonance wave-lengths are affected more by immediate and actual deviation from the missing cone equivalent mouthpiece volume than that of f1.......do I really have to go on?

I must admit that I have not followed well the lengthy debate on this subject, because it seems to me totally irrelevant to anything having to do with playing; more an exercise in mental masturbation than anything else. 

You say:


"Because, it is at the extreme  volumes of each phase within the wave-form&#39;s cycle, that the effects of  too much or too little volume will first become apparent.  It is there  that the regime will break down, long before the effects of the average  EMV cause any difficulty at all.

I am skeptical that this is true. How will the regime break down? Even, arguendo, that the f1 frequency is changed somewhat by it&#39;s second cycle up the tube, due to differences in the Veff, what does that have to do with the price of eggs? Mode locking guarantees that the harmonics will march
 right along, whether they further change the regime or not. Yes, this may change in f2, but so what?

Since the sound does not warble, we know that the wave timing is determined by some average of the reed open and reed closed volume. It varies somewhat by strength and embouchure, but this means that the only parameter that is fixed is the mpc volume. So what is your plan? Are you going to vary
 the MEV for each reed and embouchure position?

I hope you realize the import of that Benade quote I posted. The horn must first be adjusted at the smallest MEV, so as to give the truest representation of the tube resonances, and then it must be readjusted at the player&#39;s preferred embouchure, because the frequency varies asymptotically towards
 the tube resonances as you progressively pinch up on the reed, but that is not the way you play. All this minute measurement of moment-to-moment MEV divided by the open/closed time of the reed at different frequencies ......

Hey! Here is the link to the nerd-sniping cartoon that Joe Wolfe sent me. You should be able to relate ;-)

This is totally wrong Toby.  Each fn harmonic has it&#39;s own wave, which is affected by mouthpiece volume to a greater extent than f1.  The f1 wave has no influence on them at all.  Mode locking has no influence on them at all.

I invite you AGAIN to disprove the algebraic formula, or show that it
does not apply, or to prove my test invalid.  I doubt that you will try,
as to do so, you will have to then acknowledge my results and logic. 
You prefer to blatantly  disregard the facts altogether or to play
"confused".

Your theory that the mouthpiece equivalent volume is the average of the
closed volume and the maximum open volume has not been proven by your
study.

In the study you:
- measured the mouthpiece geometric volume,
-measured a pitch played on the mouthpiece alone
-computed the length of a cylinder with that diameter with that resonant
frequency
-computed the volume of said cylinder
-designated the volume of that cylinder the "average" mouthpiece
equivalent volume
-estimated the maximum mouthpiece volume from the above figures

In other words, you took your assumption that the equivalent mouthpiece
volume was the average  of the closed and maximum open volumes, and
created a theoretical maximum open mouthpiece volume to validate your
assumption.  This is not proof by any stretch of the imagination.  Not
until you can find a way to accurately measure what you call the maximum
mouthpiece opening under actual playing conditions will you be able to
legitimately claim that have proven your theory.  Until then it is just
a hypothesis based upon an assumption.

...your second assumption that the MEV is dependent upon the ratio of
the opening and closing time of the reed is completely false."
Lance wrote:

I reject your semantic fabrication.  I made no such assumption. 
Benade&#39;s MEV is strictly based upon the average of the extreme volumes
within the cycle.  As I clearly stated in my last post, Benade does not
include time domain considerations.  My analysis does, as I consider
them important.

Lance look at your study at    http://www.martinmods.com/cylcon.htm
&lt;http://www.martinmods.com/cylcon.htm>
On page 2 there is a chart which clearly shows that according to your
"theory" the equivalent mouthpiece volume "EMV"  is greater than that
required to match that of the ideal missing cone at low Bb and gradually
diminishes as one plays up the scale.

Your text reads:  "If time domain considerations are added, the
effective mouthpiece volume of this mouthpiece, as per Benade&#39;s
cylindrical tube test, will be optimal while playing F3, but will
increase proportional to tube length.

As written by Nederveen, the opening and closing time of a reed on a
conical instrument is approximately equal to the ratio of truncation to
tube length.  This means that as the tube gets longer the closed reed
time in the cycle becomes shorter and shorter.

You are calling my statement "that your assumption is that the MEV is
dependent upon the ratio of the opening and closing time of the reed"  a
semantic fabrication, when it is absolutely clear to anyone who reads
this page of your study that this is exactly what you are showing in
both your graph and your text.  My question is do you even know what
your own study says?

"It is true that the ratio between the closing and opening time of the
reed is equal to the ratio of the truncation
  (length of missing cone) to the tube length (to the first open tone
hole).  What you are missing completely is the fact that it is the 
length of the tube past the end of the neck that is changing to alter
the ratio of truncation---not the length/volume of the missing cone or
its substitution."
Lance wrote:

Again, this is your fabrication.  I stated no such thing.  The resonance
of the mouthpiece + constriction, which determines the truncation ratio
when compared to the changing tube length, remains constant, as it
exists only in the "reed closed" phase, during which the mouthpiece
volume is static (the reed actually flexes inward, into the chamber
some, but we&#39;ll disregard that for now).

Ok, Lance.  I had misinterpreted your reasons for claiming that the
"mouthpiece equivalent volume" increases and decreases depending upon
the tube length.  You are still wrong, but I was thinking you were wrong
for the wrong reason.  Now I understand the correct reason you were
wrong.  Please excuse my mistake.

            <pre class='message__body'>Wrong again, John.  I reject your fabrication.  The assumptions are entirely yours.  Keep them.  My test dealt with actual measurements and accurate conversions only.  Here is my procedure:

I predicted that, due to the additive nature of wave-forms, the duration, length, and equivalent volume of the complete cycle, would be the exact average of the "reed closed" and "reed open" phases.

1.  -recorded the wave-form of the mouthpiece played alone.
2.  -accurately measured the duration of the complete cycle and each phase of the wave-form against the o-scope grid.
3.  -calculated the length of the complete cycle and each phase.
4.  -calculated the equivalent cylindrical tube volumes for each length, based upon the 17mm shank diameter.

Analysis of all data derived directly from the actual wave-form showed that the volume of the tube with the complete wave-form length, was the EXACT average of the tubes with the "reed open" and "reed closed" phases, exactly as predicted and as it should be, according to the additive characteristics of wave-forms and the applicable algebraic formula for averaging, which will give the same results for any mouthpiece, for every similar test, for as many tests as anyone would care to make.  

Later, the water measurement of my mouthpiece (closed reed) was exactly the same as that calculated from the "reed closed" phase duration - to within .00x ml.

It is not wrong.  It is EMV with time domain considerations.  Everything changes if you consider time as part of the formula, which it is.  It is more complete and more accurate than Benade&#39;s EMV as it includes the characteristics of the conical air column.  You certainly don&#39;t need to include time in your EMV analysis if you are happy applying static cylindrical air column characteristics to explain those dynamically changing characteristics of a  conical tube.  I, personally, am not.

Think about your chart on page 2 Lance.  If, in reality, the mouthpiece

the notes approach high F, no one would be able to play any saxophone in
tune.  Think about it.  You are once again defending a proposition that

Only your logic and your reason, because they are based upon an incomplete conception of the reality of the case.   Here is time I will never get back:  

On the same mouthpiece, same horn, same amount of neck inserted, same player, same fingered F3 with a 50/50 "open/closed" reed cycle, a weak read plays flatter than a stiff reed, because it opens further, during the "reed open" phase of the cycle - the equivalent volume of that phase is larger, while the "reed closed"  volumes are equal. 

 On a fingered low Bb, the weak reed will play proportionally even flatter still, than the stiff reed, because:

1. the reed opens further and the equivalent volume is larger, and
2. the larger volume is maintained for a longer period of time per cycle.

Do the math.

This is totally wrong Toby.  Each fn harmonic has it&#39;s own wave, which is affected by mouthpiece volume to a greater extent than f1.  The f1 wave has no influence on them at all.  Mode locking has no influence on them at all.

I don&#39;t know, Toby.  How far out of line are they?  A little?  A lot?  Too much to participate?  Are they all equally out of alignment?  Did they all become unable to participate at the same instant?  I think it&#39;s all a matter of degree and a gradual shift, don&#39;t you?   I&#39;m surprised at the lack of insight in your question.

The mouthpiece + constriction resonance which re-opens the reed (and thus determines truncation ratio, de facto) occurs in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle (first part of the 2nd length of the tube).  The length of that phase is entirely dependent on the volume of the mouthpiece.  As the reed is closed, that phase (for that mouthpiece + reed) will always be the same length, no matter what note is played.

Past that you want the Helmholtz resonance of the mpc to mimic

Only your logic and your reason, because they are based upon an incomplete conception of the reality of the case.   Here is time I will never get back:  

On the same mouthpiece, same horn, same amount of neck inserted, same player, same fingered F3 with a 50/50 "open/closed" reed cycle, a weak read plays flatter than a stiff reed, because it opens further, during the "reed open" phase of the cycle - the equivalent volume of that phase is larger,
 while the "reed closed"  volumes are equal. 

 On a fingered low Bb, the weak reed will play proportionally even flatter still, than the stiff reed, because:

1. the reed opens further and the equivalent volume is larger, and
2. the larger volume is maintained for a longer period of time per cycle.

Do the math.

The mouthpiece + constriction resonance which re-opens the reed (and thus determines truncation ratio, de facto) occurs in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle (first part of the 2nd length of the tube).  The length of that phase is entirely dependent on the volume of the mouthpiece.  As
 the reed is closed, that phase (for that mouthpiece + reed) will always be the same length, no matter what note is played.

                                    The truncation ratio varies as the ratio of the diameter of the two ends of the conic frustum (assuming a constant cone angle). It varies according to the note being played. It has nothing at all to do with the mpc volume, the smaller end always being the end of

 Lance look at your study at    http://www.martinmo ds.com/cylcon. htm 
 On page 2 there is a chart which clearly shows that according to your "theory" the equivalent mouthpiece volume "EMV"  is greater than that required to match that of the ideal missing cone at low Bb and gradually diminishes as one plays up the scale.
 
 Your text reads:  "If time domain considerations are added, the effective mouthpiece volume of this mouthpiece, as per Benade&#39;s cylindrical tube test, will be optimal while playing F3, but will increase proportional to tube length.
 
 As written by Nederveen, the opening and closing time of a reed on a conical instrument is approximately equal to the ratio of truncation to tube length.  This means that as the tube gets longer the closed reed time in the cycle becomes shorter and shorter.

 excuse my mistake.

      Where do you get the information that the reed opens further for lower notes?

Only your logic and your reason, because they are based upon an incomplete conception of the reality of the case.   Here is time I will never get back:  



On the same mouthpiece, same horn, same amount of neck inserted, same player, same fingered F3 with a 50/50 "open/closed" reed cycle, a weak read plays flatter than a stiff reed, because it opens further, during the "reed open" phase of the cycle - the equivalent volume of that phase is larger,
 while the "reed closed"  volumes are equal. 



 On a fingered low Bb, the weak reed will play proportionally even flatter still, than the stiff reed, because:



1. the reed opens further and the equivalent volume is larger, and

2. the larger volume is maintained for a longer period of time per cycle.



Do the math.

      Lance, this cannot be correct, since the truncation ratio varies with the note being played. Joe Wolfe was very clear on this point.

The mouthpiece + constriction resonance which re-opens the reed (and thus determines truncation ratio, de facto) occurs in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle (first part of the 2nd length of the tube).  The length of that phase is entirely dependent on the volume of the
 mouthpiece.  As the reed is closed, that phase (for that mouthpiece + reed) will always be the same length, no matter what note is played.

                                    The truncation ratio varies as the ratio of the diameter of the two ends of the conic frustum (assuming a constant cone angle). It varies according to the note being played. It has nothing at all
 to do with the mpc volume, the smaller end always being the end of the neck.

 The theory is proven, by the 100%, universally valid, algebraic formula which applies, and substantiated by the indisputable results of my test.  I invite you AGAIN to disprove the algebraic formula, or show that it does not apply, or to prove my test invalid.  I doubt that you will 
 try, as to do so, you will have to then acknowledge my results and logic.  You prefer to blatantly  disregard the facts altogether or to play "confused".   

 

 Your theory that the mouthpiece equivalent volume is the average of the closed volume and the maximum open volume has not been proven by your study.  

 

 In the study you:

 - measured the mouthpiece geometric volume, 

 -measured a pitch played on the mouthpiece alone 

 -computed the length of a cylinder with that diameter with that resonant frequency

 -computed the volume of said cylinder

 -designated the volume of that cylinder the "average" mouthpiece equivalent volume

 -estimated the maximum mouthpiece volume from the above figures

 

 In other words, you took your assumption that the equivalent mouthpiece volume was the average  of the closed and maximum open volumes, and created a theoretical maximum open mouthpiece volume to validate your assumption.  This is not proof by any stretch of 
 the imagination.  Not until you can find a way to accurately measure what you call the maximum mouthpiece opening under actual playing conditions will you be able to legitimately claim that have proven your theory.  Until then it is just a hypothesis based upon an assumption.

 

 ...your second assumption that the MEV is dependent upon the ratio of the opening and closing time of the reed is completely false."

 Lance wrote:

  

 I reject your semantic fabrication.  I made no such assumption.  Benade&#39;s MEV is strictly based upon the average of the extreme volumes within the cycle.  As I clearly stated in my last post, Benade does not include time domain considerations.  My analysis 
 does, as I consider them important.

 

 Lance look at your study at    http://www.martinmo ds.com/cylcon. htm 

 On page 2 there is a chart which clearly shows that according to your "theory" the equivalent mouthpiece volume "EMV"  is greater than that required to match that of the ideal missing cone at low Bb and gradually diminishes as one plays up the scale.

 

 Your text reads:  "If time domain considerations are added, the effective mouthpiece volume of this mouthpiece, as per Benade&#39;s cylindrical tube test, will be optimal while playing F3, but will increase proportional to tube length.

 

 As written by Nederveen, the opening and closing time of a reed on a conical instrument is approximately equal to the ratio of truncation to tube length.  This means that as the tube gets longer the closed reed time in the cycle becomes shorter and shorter.

 

 You are calling my statement "that your assumption is that the MEV is dependent upon the ratio of the opening and closing time of the reed"  a semantic fabrication, when it is absolutely clear to anyone who reads this page of your study that this is exactly what you are showing in 
 both your graph and your text.  My question is do you even know what your own study says?

 

 "It is true that the ratio between the closing and opening time of the reed is equal to the ratio of the truncation 

  (length of missing cone) to the tube length (to the first open tone hole).  What you are missing completely is the fact that it is the  length of the tube past the end of the neck that is changing to alter the ratio of truncation-- -not the length/volume of the missing cone or 
 its substitution. "

 Lance wrote:

 

 Again, this is your fabrication.  I stated no such thing.  The resonance of the mouthpiece + constriction, which determines the truncation ratio when compared to the changing tube length, remains constant, as it exists only in the "reed closed" phase, during which the mouthpiece volume 
 is static (the reed actually flexes inward, into the chamber some, but we&#39;ll disregard that for now).

 

 Ok, Lance.  I had misinterpreted your reasons for claiming that the "mouthpiece equivalent volume" increases and decreases depending upon the tube length.  You are still wrong, but I was thinking you were wrong for the wrong reason.  Now I understand the correct reason you were 
 wrong.  Please excuse my mistake.

      The literature is pretty clear on this point: If the mpc volume reasonably matches that of the missing apex, that takes care of notes up until the highs (IIRC as long as the wavelength is more than 1/4 the length of the truncation). Past that you want the Helmholtz resonance of the mpc to mimic
 that of the missing part of the cone. This is supposed to give a reasonable match from bottom to top, and this is why I feel that this debate is a waste of time. Of course it is your time and you are free to do as you wish with it.

Lance, I have done the math and the playing tests for over 40 years. The saxophone mouthpiece does not become a mismatch for the volume of the missing cone as one descends the scale to low Bb.  Your premise that the F3 is the perfect volume match is based upon your misunderstanding of Benade&#39;s writings.  You have based your whole theory on a false premise and you are just too hard headed to admit it.  You would rather be right than reasonable or logical.

Your study indicates the the maximum open mouthpiece volume to be 2.84 ml larger than the average.  Furthermore you claim that on low Bb the reed is open 86% of the time and closed 14% of the time.  With your proportional averaging then the closed mouthpiece volume of 19.97 ml contributes 14% of the volume or 2.8ml and the maximum open volume of 25.65 ml contributes 86% of the volume or 22.06 ml of the volume for a total of MEV of 24.86 ml which is 2 ml greater than the average EMV which presumably matches that of the missing cone.  This would automatically produce a low Bb that is nearly 40 Cents flat on an instrument that is otherwise built well in tune.  That has not been my experience with saxophone mouthpieces on good instruments for over 40 years.  You might want to reconsider.

            <pre class='message__body'>Now that you mention it Lance, I have been trying to recreate your results using your wav file and my Virtins multi instrument oscilloscope and I have been getting a very different wave form.  I have also bought and downloaded the inexpensive Zelscope software that you used that is much less sophisticated than the Virtins and again there is no similarity when I play your wave file into that either.

Being less experienced than you in dealing with these wave patterns, I have one question.  That is how can you tell exactly which portion of the wave represents the closed reed portion of the waveform, and which portion represents the open reed portion of the waveform?  It seems that your entire study hinges on the millisecond duration of each portion of the wave and that where each starts and ends is of critical importance to the results.

 Only your logic and your reason, because they are based upon an incomplete conception of the reality of the case.   Here is time I will never get back:  
 
 On the same mouthpiece, same horn, same amount of neck inserted, same player, same fingered F3 with a 50/50 "open/closed" reed cycle, a weak read plays flatter than a stiff reed, because it opens further, during the "reed open" phase of the cycle - the equivalent volume of that phase is larger, 
 while the "reed closed"  volumes are equal. 
 
  On a fingered low Bb, the weak reed will play proportionally even flatter still, than the stiff reed, because:
 
 1. the reed opens further and the equivalent volume is larger, and
 2. the larger volume is maintained for a longer period of time per cycle.
 
 Do the math.

                                    The literature is pretty clear on this point: If the mpc volume reasonably matches that of the missing apex, that takes care of notes up until the highs (IIRC as long as the wavelength is more than 1/4 the length of the truncation). Past that you want the
 Helmholtz resonance of the mpc to mimic  that of the missing part of the cone. This is supposed to give a reasonable match from bottom to top, and this is why I feel that this debate is a waste of time. Of course it is your time and you are free to do as you wish with it.

 Think about your chart on page 2 Lance.  If, in reality, the mouthpiece equivalent volume so poorly matches the volume of the missing cone until the notes approach high F, no one would be able to play any saxophone in tune.  Think about it.  You are once again defending a  proposition that defies

      Now that you mention it Lance, I have been trying to recreate your results using your wav file and my Virtins multi instrument oscilloscope and I have been getting a very different wave form.  I have also bought and downloaded the inexpensive Zelscope software that you used that is much less sophisticated than the Virtins and again there is no similarity when I play your wave file into that either.



Being less experienced than you in dealing with these wave patterns, I have one question.  That is how can you tell exactly which portion of the wave represents the closed reed portion of the waveform, and which portion represents the open reed portion of the waveform?  It seems that your entire study hinges on the millisecond duration of each portion of the wave and that where each starts and ends is of critical importance to the results.

                                    The literature is pretty clear on this point: If the mpc volume reasonably matches that of the missing apex, that takes care of notes up until the highs (IIRC as long as the wavelength is more
 than 1/4 the length of the truncation). Past that you want the Helmholtz resonance of the mpc to mimic  that of the missing part of the cone. This is supposed to give a reasonable match from bottom to top, and this is why I feel that this debate is a waste of time. Of course it is your time and
 you are free to do as you wish with it.

 Think about your chart on page 2 Lance.  If, in reality, the mouthpiece equivalent volume so poorly matches the volume of the missing cone until the notes approach high F, no one would be able to play any saxophone in tune.  Think about it.  You are once again defending a

 Lance, I have done the math and the playing tests for over 40 years. The saxophone mouthpiece does not become a mismatch for the volume of the missing cone as one descends the scale to low Bb.  Your premise that the F3 is the perfect volume match is based upon your misunderstanding of Benade&#39;s
 writings.  You have based your whole theory on a false premise and you are just too hard headed to admit it.  You would rather be right than reasonable or logical.
 
 Your study indicates the the maximum open mouthpiece volume to be 2.84 ml larger than the average.  Furthermore you claim that on low Bb the reed is open 86% of the time and closed 14% of the time.  With your proportional averaging then the closed mouthpiece volume of 19.97 ml contributes 14% of
 the volume or 2.8ml and the maximum open volume of 25.65 ml contributes 86% of the volume or 22.06 ml of the volume for a total of MEV of 24.86 ml which is 2 ml greater than the average EMV which presumably matches that of the missing cone.  This would automatically produce a low Bb that is
 nearly 40 Cents flat on an instrument that is otherwise built well in tune.  That has not been my experience with saxophone mouthpieces on good instruments for over 40 years.  You might want to reconsider.

            <pre class='message__body'>From Fletcher:

When treatments of the two parts of the system have been set up in the time domain, it is relatively simple to connect them together by requiring consistency of acoustic quantities at the interface. This generally results in an integral equation s which can be solved numerically to give the flow
 waveform and pressure waveform at the player&#39;s mouth, the junction between the generator and the resonator, or the open mouth of the horn. The inclusion of quantities at open finger holes involves splitting the horn into sections placed end-to-end, which clearly complicates the computation. These
 final acoustic quantities are then readily converted to a calculated acoustic output.

One of the nice features of this approach is that it leads automatically to a proper treatment of transients, and particularly of the initial transient, since the integration of the equations requires specification of the way in which blowing pressure is applied and then follows the system
 evolution. This allows for the possibility of different stable solutions depending upon the initiating conditions, a feature of wind-instrument behaviour in certain playing ranges.
Perhaps even more significantly, the time-domain approach makes no
assumptions about the nature of the upper partials of the sound. Their
amplitudes and frequencies are determined automatically from the
computed waveforms. It turns out, indeed, that these upper partials are
generally locked into harmonic relationship with the fundamental, since
musical requirements demand this of a successful instrument design, but
inharmonic relations can arise for certain fingerings and playing techniques.

Come on Toby. This is idiotic.  The resonances are locked because Conn said they had to be, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t sell any instruments? 

The definition of a partial is an integral relationship between a resonance frequency and the fundamental.  A partial is locked, by definition.  A resonance is not, as it spans a range of frequencies.

      What is really crazy about this whole conversation is the fact that at the low end, even a huge variation in mpc volume hardly affects the intonation, as the tube impedances are very strong with so much air column length. The cone hardly notices that it is missing anything at the top. This is why
 you cannot lip low notes almost at all.

 Lance, I have done the math and the playing tests for over 40 years. The saxophone mouthpiece does not become a mismatch for the volume of the missing cone as one descends the scale to low Bb.  Your premise that the F3 is the perfect volume match is based upon your misunderstanding of Benade&#39;s
 writings.  You have based your whole theory on a false premise and you are just too hard headed to admit it.  You would rather be right than reasonable or logical.

 

 Your study indicates the the maximum open mouthpiece volume to be 2.84 ml larger than the average.  Furthermore you claim that on low Bb the reed is open 86% of the time and closed 14% of the time.  With your proportional averaging then the closed mouthpiece volume of 19.97 ml contributes 14% of
 the volume or 2.8ml and the maximum open volume of 25.65 ml contributes 86% of the volume or 22.06 ml of the volume for a total of MEV of 24.86 ml which is 2 ml greater than the average EMV which presumably matches that of the missing cone.  This would automatically produce a low Bb that is
 nearly 40 Cents flat on an instrument that is otherwise built well in tune.  That has not been my experience with saxophone mouthpieces on good instruments for over 40 years.  You might want to reconsider.

            <pre class='message__body'>One more from Fletcher on mode-locking and non-linearity:

"In a sustained-tone instrument, a resonator that is substantially linear in its properties, though not necessarily harmonic, is closely coupled to a generator that is itself driven by a steady force--bow motion or air pressure--and controlled by the resulting oscillations so as to contribute to a
 negative mechanical or acoustic resistance. If this generator were strictly linear, then it would set a large number of resonator modes into oscillation at frequencies little different from their natural frequencies, as determined by the reactive part of the generator impedance, and the sound
 would be entirely different from the phase-locked harmonic sounds to which we are accustomed. This possibility, and its consequences for music, has been explored by Sethares using computer-generated sounds, but will not concern us here.

In reality, the generator in a sustained-tone musical instrument is always highly nonlinear in its response, as shown in the examples of Figure 1.  In each case there is a negative resistance region, but the magnitude of this resistance varies over each cycle of the resonator oscillation. In the
 case of a bowed string and a vibrating reed there is a sharp additional nonlinearity at one end of the operating range. As the mathematics in the Appendix shows, this nonlinearity can lead to shifts in the operating frequencies of all the modes until they are locked into precise harmonic
 relationship, giving the familiar sounds and spectra of Western musical instruments.

This fails only when the modes are extremely inharmonic in their frequency relationships, as for example with peculiar non-standard fingerings on woodwind instruments, and the generator is manipulatred so as to reduce its nonlinearity..."

            <pre class='message__body'>Take it up with Fletcher. His words not mine. My point is that if a lower mode is present, and strong, basically misaligned resonances are going to be pulled into place (or if they are strong, are going to pull the lower resonance somewhat). That being the case, it won&#39;t make a bit of difference
 what the reed timing is, since there can only be a single regime of oscillation at one time (generally speaking, see Fletcher). Yes, higher modes can settle into regimes that have different frequencies from the partials in lower modes, but that seems to me, if I understand you correctly, to be
 quite different from what you are saying.

            <pre class='message__body'>Fletcher&#39;s terminology is screwy and that confuses you.  A mode is not a resonance.  A mode is a single, specific harmonic resonance frequency that has a specific integral relationship to the fundamental, thus we say, 1st mode, 2nd mode, 3rd mode, etc.  A resonance is a wide range of frequencies.  One of the frequencies of the resonance may participate in the regime and become a mode, if the integral frequency lies within the half-amplitude frequency bandwidth of the resonance.  

Go read Benade again.

      Take it up with Fletcher. His words not mine. My point is that if a lower mode is present, and strong, basically misaligned resonances are going to be pulled into place (or if they are strong, are going to pull the lower resonance somewhat). That being the case, it won&#39;t make a bit of difference
 what the reed timing is, since there can only be a single regime of oscillation at one time (generally speaking, see Fletcher). Yes, higher modes can settle into regimes that have different frequencies from the partials in lower modes, but that seems to me, if I understand you correctly, to be
 quite different from what you are saying.

Come on Toby. This is idiotic.  The resonances are locked because Conn said they had to be, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t sell any instruments? 



The definition of a partial is an integral relationship between a resonance frequency and the fundamental.  A partial is locked, by
 definition.  A resonance is not, as it spans a range of frequencies.

            <pre class='message__body'>Boys,

I will now, in two parts, give you the formulas which prove that Benade&#39;s EMV, calculated on a cylindrical tube, does not effectively apply to a conical air column, without time domain considerations.  Since John has considerable familiarity with mathematics, I trust he will have no problems with them.  First:

The Cylindrical Tube Wave-form Cycle

This formula describes the additive nature of the (fundamental) wave-form cycle of a sax mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube.  It is universally applicable for any mouthpiece:

X = + phase: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.
Y = - phase: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.
Z = completed cycle: averaged, duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick, of X and Y.

The Formula:

X/2 + Y/2 = Z

How do we get this formula?  The wave-form consists of 2 phases, X is one of 2, or X/2 and Y is one of 2 or Y/2.  Add them together and you get Z. Simple.

Given any mouthpiece, some tape, some water, and a cylindrical tube, we can easily find the actual closed, hard-walled volume, and Benade&#39;s Equivalent Volume, for the mouthpiece.  We&#39;ll use John&#39;s EMV and MCV test results.  We have these 2 known quantities:

Reed Closed Volume: 6.87 ml.  We make this Y
EMV: 9.13 ml.  This is Z
The Reed Open volume is unknown. We make this X

So we have:

X/2 + 6.87/2 = 9.13

Multiply both sides by 2:

X + 6.87 = 18.26

Subtract 6.87 from both sides:

X = 11.39

The "Reed Open" phase is 11.39 ml, but, we realize that the "Reed Open" volume can not possibly be a static 11.39 ml.  It varies between an infinitely small amount more than the "Reed Closed" volume, (so we&#39;ll just use the "Reed Closed" volume for it&#39;s minimum value) and an unknown maximum volume, during each "Reed Open" phase.  We can apply our formula to this phase to get the maximum volume amount:

x = unknown maximum value
y = known minimum value (Reed Closed): 6.87 ml
z = completed phase average value: 11.39 ml

x/2 + y/2 = z

or,

x/2 + 6.87/2 = 11.39

multiply both sides by 2:

x + 6.87 = 22.78

subtract 6.87 from both sides:

x = 15.91

This gives us a complete (cylindrical tube) Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range profile ( my earlier diagram had 1 math mistake for the Reed Open max volume: 15.91 ml instead of 16. whatever)

Reed Closed Mouthpiece Volume: 6.87 ml
Equivalent Mouthpiece Volume (average of Reed Closed and Reed Open average: 9.13 ml
Reed Open Volume (averaged): 11.39 ml
Reed Open Min Volume (closed): 6.87 ml
Reed Open Max Volume:15.91 ml

You can try this with as many different mouthpieces as you want, start from the measured closed volume or actual wave-form o&#39;scope measurements.  It works every time.  This information will be of use to us, when we analyze the formula for additive wave-forms of conical tubes, in part II.

This section will prove that Benade&#39;s EMV, as calculated on a cylindrical tube, does not effectively apply to the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.


Conical Tube Wave-form Cycle


This formula describes the additive nature of the (fundamental) wave-form cycle of a sax mouthpiece on a conical tube.  It is identical to the first simple formula that was used for cylindrical tube wave-form cycles, but as is necessary for an accurate description of the Y phase, it includes a factor for the truncation ratio.  The formula provides results identical to those of the cylindrical formula, using cylindrical data.  It is universally applicable for any mouthpiece/horn combination:

X = + phase or Reed Open: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.
Y = - phase or Reed Closed: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.
Z = completed cycle: averaged, duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick, of X and Y.
TR = truncation ratio: missing cone length/1/2 wave-length

The Formula:

X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z


How do we get this formula?  The wave-form consists of 2 phases, X, Reed Open, is one of 2, or X/2.  The other one of 2
 consists of:

1. Y or Reed Closed, for the length of TIME it takes sound to go the length of the missing cone (reed closed length)/the length of time it takes sound to go the length of the tube (1/2 wavelength), or the truncation ratio, or Y*TR/2, added to,

2. X or Reed Open, for the remainder of the phase 1-TR (If the TR is .25, then the remainder of the phase is 1-.25, or .75.), or (X*(1-TR))/2.

Add them together and you get Z. Simple again.

Once again, given any mouthpiece, some tape, some water, and a cylindrical tube, we can easily find the actual closed, hard-walled volume, and Benade&#39;s Equivalent Volume, for the mouthpiece, and then plug that info into this formula.  We&#39;ll use John&#39;s EMV and MCV test for the played note, F#1, on his SBA alto.  We have these known quantities:

Reed Closed Volume: 6.87 ml.  We make this Y
EMV: 9.13 ml.  This is Z
The Reed Open volume (average): 11.39 We make this X
Missing Cone Length (reed closed volume): The resonance which re-opens the reed exists in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle exclusively.  The length of a cone with a base radius of 6.3, and a volume of 6.87 ml is: Length = 3000*6.87/Pi*6.3*6.3, Length = 165.29 mm
Wave-length (F#1) 1570 mm
1/2 wave-length: 785 mm
TR: 165.29/785 = .21

So we have:

X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z

Or:

11.39/2 + (11.39*(1-.21))/2 + (6.87*.21)/2 = Z

Calculate

5.695 + 4.499 + .721 = 10.915 ml

Here are calculations for various notes based on John&#39;s SBA data:

John&#39;s missing cone length of 213 mm: 5.965 + 0 + 3.435 = 9.13 ml
F3 392.5 mm wave-length:..............5.965 + 0.911 + 2.885 = 9.49 ml
F2 785 mm wave -length :..............5.965 + 3.303 + 1.442 = 10.44 ml
F1 1570 mm wave-length:...............5.965 + 4.499 + 0.721 = 10.915 ml
Bb0 2493 mm wave-length:..............5.965 + 4.954 + 0.446 = 11.096 ml

The purpose of Benade&#39;s EMV calculation using a cylindrical tube, is to establish the AVERAGE volume of the "Reed Open" Average and "Reed Closed" phases of the cycle for the mouthpiece.  It does a precise job, as the EMV remains constant over the playing range of a cylindrical tube of varying lengths. The problem with applying Benade&#39;s EMV to a saxophone is, the reed compliance volume (the extra volume based upon the way the reed vibrates) of the mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube, bears no resemblance to the reed compliance volume of the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.  The reed vibrates differently on a conical tube.  The lower the note, the larger the average volume of the "Reed Open" and "Reed Closed" phases.  According to John&#39;s method, his saxophone requires a mouthpiece with 8.88 ml volume to work optimally, and though he claims his mouthpiece matches that to within 1%, in actuality, according to the way the reed vibrates on a conical tube,
 it varies from an error of 3.8% (too large) on F3, to 17.7% (too large) on low B, with a 12.5% (too large) error in the middle register.

The solution: match the middle register, average volume, using the conical Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range formula, with the missing cone volume of your instrument, for optimal over-all response and intonation.   If playing baritone or bass and the low register is most prevalent, match the low register average.

I will be providing ongoing tests, comparative intonation charts and audio samples for each method, so readers can decide for themselves, what really works best, the numbers that don&#39;t line up, or the numbers that do.

      Part II



This section will prove that Benade&#39;s EMV, as calculated on a cylindrical tube, does not effectively apply to the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.



Conical Tube Wave-form Cycle



This formula describes the additive nature of the (fundamental) wave-form cycle of a sax mouthpiece on a conical tube.  It is identical to the first simple formula that was used for cylindrical tube wave-form cycles, but as is necessary for an accurate description of the Y phase, it includes a factor for the truncation ratio.  The formula provides results identical to those of the cylindrical formula, using cylindrical data.  It is universally applicable for any mouthpiece/horn combination:

Y = - phase or Reed Closed: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.

Z = completed cycle: averaged, duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick, of X and Y.

TR = truncation ratio: missing cone length/1/2 wave-length



The Formula:



X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z



How do we get this formula?  The wave-form consists of 2 phases, X, Reed Open, is one of 2, or X/2.  The other one of 2

 consists of:



1. Y or Reed Closed, for the length of TIME it takes sound to go the length of the missing cone (reed closed length)/the length of time it takes sound to go the length of the tube (1/2 wavelength), or the truncation ratio, or Y*TR/2, added to,



2. X or Reed Open, for the remainder of the phase 1-TR (If the TR is .25, then the remainder of the phase is 1-.25, or .75.), or (X*(1-TR))/2.

The Reed Open volume (average): 11.39 We make this X

Missing Cone Length (reed closed volume): The resonance which re-opens the reed exists in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle exclusively.  The length of a cone with a base radius of 6.3, and a volume of 6.87 ml is: Length = 3000*6.87/Pi* 6.3*6.3, Length = 165.29 mm

Wave-length (F#1) 1570 mm

1/2 wave-length: 785 mm

TR: 165.29/785 = .21



So we have:



X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z



Or:

Calculate



5.695 + 4.499 + .721 = 10.915 ml



Here are calculations for various notes based on John&#39;s SBA data:



John&#39;s missing cone length of 213 mm: 5.965 + 0 + 3.435 = 9.13 ml

F3 392.5 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 0.911 + 2.885 = 9.49 ml

F2 785 mm wave -length :........... ...5.965 + 3.303 + 1.442 = 10.44 ml

F1 1570 mm wave-length: ......... ......5.965 + 4.499 + 0.721 = 10.915 ml

Bb0 2493 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 4.954 + 0.446 = 11.096 ml



The purpose of Benade&#39;s EMV calculation using a cylindrical tube, is to establish the AVERAGE volume of the "Reed Open" Average and "Reed Closed" phases of the cycle for the mouthpiece.  It does a precise job, as the EMV remains constant over the playing range of a cylindrical tube of varying lengths. The problem with applying Benade&#39;s EMV to a saxophone is, the reed compliance volume (the extra volume based upon the way the reed vibrates) of the mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube, bears no resemblance to the reed compliance volume of the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.  The reed vibrates differently on a conical tube.  The lower the note, the larger the average volume of the "Reed Open" and "Reed Closed" phases.  According to John&#39;s method, his saxophone requires a mouthpiece with 8.88 ml volume to work optimally, and though he claims his mouthpiece matches that to within 1%, in actuality, according to the way the reed vibrates on a conical tube,

 it varies from an error of 3.8% (too large) on F3, to 17.7% (too large) on low B, with a 12.5% (too large) error in the middle register.



The solution: match the middle register, average volume, using the conical Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range formula, with the missing cone volume of your instrument, for optimal over-all response and intonation.   If playing baritone or bass and the low register is most prevalent, match the low register average.



I will be providing ongoing tests, comparative intonation charts and audio samples for each method, so readers can decide for themselves, what really works best, the numbers that don&#39;t line up, or the numbers that do.

      Part II



This section will prove that Benade&#39;s EMV, as calculated on a cylindrical tube, does not effectively apply to the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.



Conical Tube Wave-form Cycle



This formula describes the additive nature of the (fundamental) wave-form cycle of a sax mouthpiece on a conical tube.  It is identical to the first simple formula that was used for cylindrical tube wave-form cycles, but as is necessary for an accurate description of the Y phase, it includes a factor for the truncation ratio.  The formula provides results identical to those of the cylindrical formula, using cylindrical data.  It is universally applicable for any mouthpiece/horn combination:



X = + phase or Reed Open: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.

Y = - phase or Reed Closed: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.

Z = completed cycle: averaged, duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick, of X and Y.

TR = truncation ratio: missing cone length/1/2 wave-length



The Formula:



X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z



How do we get this formula?  The wave-form consists of 2 phases, X, Reed Open, is one of 2, or X/2.  The other one of 2

 consists of:



1. Y or Reed Closed, for the length of TIME it takes sound to go the length of the missing cone (reed closed length)/the length of time it takes sound to go the length of the tube (1/2 wavelength), or the truncation ratio, or Y*TR/2, added to,



2. X or Reed Open, for the remainder of the phase 1-TR (If the TR is .25, then the remainder of the phase is 1-.25, or .75.), or (X*(1-TR))/2.



Add them together and you get Z. Simple again.



Once again, given any mouthpiece, some tape, some water, and a cylindrical tube, we can easily find the actual closed, hard-walled volume, and Benade&#39;s Equivalent Volume, for the mouthpiece, and then plug that info into this formula.  We&#39;ll use John&#39;s EMV and MCV test for the played note, F#1, on his SBA alto.  We have these known quantities:



Reed Closed Volume: 6.87 ml.  We make this Y

EMV: 9.13 ml.  This is Z

The Reed Open volume (average): 11.39 We make this X

Missing Cone Length (reed closed volume): The resonance which re-opens the reed exists in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle exclusively.  The length of a cone with a base radius of 6.3, and a volume of 6.87 ml is: Length = 3000*6.87/Pi* 6.3*6.3, Length = 165.29 mm

Wave-length (F#1) 1570 mm

1/2 wave-length: 785 mm

TR: 165.29/785 = .21



So we have:



X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z



Or:



11.39/2 + (11.39*(1-.21) )/2 + (6.87*.21)/2 = Z



Calculate



5.695 + 4.499 + .721 = 10.915 ml



Here are calculations for various notes based on John&#39;s SBA data:



John&#39;s missing cone length of 213 mm: 5.965 + 0 + 3.435 = 9.13 ml

F3 392.5 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 0.911 + 2.885 = 9.49 ml

F2 785 mm wave -length :........... ...5.965 + 3.303 + 1.442 = 10.44 ml

F1 1570 mm wave-length: ......... ......5.965 + 4.499 + 0.721 = 10.915 ml

Bb0 2493 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 4.954 + 0.446 = 11.096 ml

 1/2 wave-length: 785 mm
 TR: 165.29/785 = .21
 
 So we have:
 
 X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z
 
 Or:
 
 11.39/2 + (11.39*(1-.21) )/2 + (6.87*.21)/2 = Z
 
 Calculate
 
 5.695 + 4.499 + .721 = 10.915 ml
 
 Here are calculations for various notes based on John&#39;s SBA data:
 
 John&#39;s missing cone length of 213 mm: 5.965 + 0 + 3.435 = 9.13 ml
 F3 392.5 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 0.911 + 2.885 = 9.49 ml
 F2 785 mm wave -length :........... ...5.965 + 3.303 + 1.442 = 10.44 ml
 F1 1570 mm wave-length: ......... ......5.965 + 4.499 + 0.721 = 10.915 ml
 Bb0 2493 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 4.954 + 0.446 = 11.096 ml
 
 The purpose of Benade&#39;s EMV calculation using a cylindrical tube, is to establish the AVERAGE volume of the "Reed Open" Average and "Reed Closed" phases of the cycle for the mouthpiece.  It does a precise job, as the EMV remains constant over the playing range of a cylindrical tube of varying
 lengths. The problem with applying Benade&#39;s EMV to a saxophone is, the reed compliance volume (the extra volume based upon the way the reed vibrates) of the mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube, bears no resemblance to the reed compliance volume of the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.  The reed
 vibrates differently on a conical tube.  The lower the note, the larger the average volume of the "Reed Open" and "Reed Closed" phases.  According to John&#39;s method, his saxophone requires a mouthpiece with 8.88 ml volume to work optimally, and though he claims his mouthpiece matches that to
 within 1%, in actuality, according to the way the reed vibrates on a  conical tube,
  it varies from an error of 3.8% (too large) on F3, to 17.7% (too large) on low B, with a 12.5% (too large) error in the middle register.
 
 The solution: match the middle register, average volume, using the conical Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range formula, with the missing cone volume of your instrument, for optimal over-all response and intonation.   If playing baritone or bass and the low register is most prevalent, match the low
 register average.
 
 I will be providing ongoing tests, comparative intonation charts and audio samples for each method, so readers can decide for themselves, what really works best, the numbers that don&#39;t line up, or the numbers that do.

            <pre class='message__body'>Your comments are totally unrelated Toby, and frankly, I&#39;m very surprised at how little insight you have into this.  Benade does not use any wave propagation formulas to figure EMV, so why should I?  All things being equal, the simplest solution is usually the best.  The simple formula, X/2 + Y/2 = Z, which you seem to find incomprehensible, is not mine.  I didn&#39;t make it up out of the Blue.  It is the known formula for averaging ANYTHING - something we all learned in 6th grade.  If 10 chickens lay eggs, and they all lay a different amount of eggs, if we add all the eggs up and divide by the number of chickens, we get the average number of eggs per chicken.  Same thing here.  Add the volumes of the phases and divide by phases.  That&#39;s EXACTLY what Benade&#39;s EMV is. That&#39;s really mysterious!  FMVR just adds the information that Benade left out.  The conical formula is the exact same thing, though it adds consideration for the fact that the
 duration of the "reed closed" phase is truncation ratio dependent - an absolutely essential element for an accurate averaging of the reality.  

I don&#39;t need to run this by anyone.  It is 6th grade math.

      Speaking of which: why not throw this at Dr. Wolfe and see what his comment is. I freely admit that I think you are over the moon, but that I am not qualified to say that definitively, since I am weak on wave propagation math, ala Scavone or Fletcher.

                                    Further:  The actual volume min/max range of the mouthpiece + reed does not change from a
 cylindrical tube to a conical tube.  Only the average of the phases changes.  The midpoint.  That point in the range where the volume is most of the time, between the two extremes.  The ideal volume.  The most characteristic volume of the mouthpiece + reed under those
 actual playing circumstances.

                                    Part II

 

 This section will prove that Benade&#39;s EMV, as calculated on a cylindrical tube, does not effectively apply to the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.

 

 Conical Tube Wave-form Cycle

 

 This formula describes the additive nature of the (fundamental) wave-form cycle of a sax mouthpiece on a conical tube.  It is identical to the first simple formula that was used for cylindrical tube wave-form cycles, but as is necessary for an accurate description of the Y phase, it includes
 a factor for the truncation ratio.  The formula provides results identical to those of the cylindrical formula, using cylindrical data.  It is universally applicable for any mouthpiece/horn combination:

 

 X = + phase or Reed Open: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.

 Y = - phase or Reed Closed: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.

 Z = completed cycle: averaged, duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick, of X and Y.

 TR = truncation ratio: missing cone length/1/2 wave-length

 

 The Formula:

 

 X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z

 

 How do we get this formula?  The wave-form consists of 2 phases, X, Reed Open, is one of 2, or X/2.  The other one of 2

  consists of:

 

 1. Y or Reed Closed, for the length of TIME it takes sound to go the length of the missing cone (reed closed length)/the length of time it takes sound to go the length of the tube (1/2 wavelength), or the truncation ratio, or Y*TR/2, added to,

 

 2. X or Reed Open, for the remainder of the phase 1-TR (If the TR is .25, then the remainder of the phase is 1-.25, or .75.), or (X*(1-TR))/2.

 

 Add them together and you get Z. Simple again.

 

 Once again, given any mouthpiece, some tape, some water, and a cylindrical tube, we can easily find the actual closed, hard-walled volume, and Benade&#39;s Equivalent Volume, for the mouthpiece, and then plug that info into this formula.  We&#39;ll use John&#39;s EMV and MCV test for the played note,
 F#1, on his SBA alto.  We have these known quantities:

 

 Reed Closed Volume: 6.87 ml.  We make this Y

 EMV: 9.13 ml.  This is Z

 The Reed Open volume (average): 11.39 We make this X

 Missing Cone Length (reed closed volume): The resonance which re-opens the reed exists in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle exclusively.  The length of a cone with a base radius of 6.3, and a volume of 6.87 ml is: Length = 3000*6.87/Pi* 6.3*6.3, Length = 165.29 mm

 Wave-length (F#1) 1570 mm

 1/2 wave-length: 785 mm

 TR: 165.29/785 = .21

 

 So we have:

 

 X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z

 

 Or:

 

 11.39/2 + (11.39*(1-.21) )/2 + (6.87*.21)/2 = Z

 

 Calculate

 

 5.695 + 4.499 + .721 = 10.915 ml

 

 Here are calculations for various notes based on John&#39;s SBA data:

 

 John&#39;s missing cone length of 213 mm: 5.965 + 0 + 3.435 = 9.13 ml

 F3 392.5 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 0.911 + 2.885 = 9.49 ml

 F2 785 mm wave -length :........... ...5.965 + 3.303 + 1.442 = 10.44 ml

 F1 1570 mm wave-length: ......... ......5.965 + 4.499 + 0.721 = 10.915 ml

 Bb0 2493 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 4.954 + 0.446 = 11.096 ml

 

 The purpose of Benade&#39;s EMV calculation using a cylindrical tube, is to establish the AVERAGE volume of the "Reed Open" Average and "Reed Closed" phases of the cycle for the mouthpiece.  It does a precise job, as the EMV remains constant over the playing range of a cylindrical tube of
 varying lengths. The problem with applying Benade&#39;s EMV to a saxophone is, the reed compliance volume (the extra volume based upon the way the reed vibrates) of the mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube, bears no resemblance to the reed compliance volume of the same mouthpiece on a conical tube. 
 The reed vibrates differently on a conical tube.  The lower the note, the larger the average volume of the "Reed Open" and "Reed Closed" phases.  According to John&#39;s method, his saxophone requires a mouthpiece with 8.88 ml volume to work optimally, and though he claims his mouthpiece
 matches that to within 1%, in actuality, according to the way the reed vibrates on a  conical tube,

  it varies from an error of 3.8% (too large) on F3, to 17.7% (too large) on low B, with a 12.5% (too large) error in the middle register.

 

 The solution: match the middle register, average volume, using the conical Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range formula, with the missing cone volume of your instrument, for optimal over-all response and intonation.   If playing baritone or bass and the low register is most prevalent, match the low
 register average.

 

 I will be providing ongoing tests, comparative intonation charts and audio samples for each method, so readers can decide for themselves, what really works best, the numbers that don&#39;t line up, or the numbers that do.

If you insist that I respond - I don&#39;t consider your question worthy of a direct answer.  You will learn more by answering my questions and figuring it out yourself.

What kind of air column are we using?
What is the characteristic reed cycle ratio for this type of air column?
How does the volume of the "reed closed" phase compare to that of the "reed open" phase?
How will any difference in volume over the entire phase, manifest itself in phase duration?
How do the phases of the wave-form compare in appearance?
Which one do you think is the "reed closed" phase?

      Again Lance you evade my question by asking one of your own.  One more time.  



How can you tell exactly which portion of the wave represents the closed reed portion of the waveform, and which portion represents the open reed portion of the waveform? 



Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>I strongly suspect that you are incapable of giving a clear and direct
answer to my question and that is the reaspm for your being rude and
evasive. Once again,

How can you determine exactly which portion of the wave represents the
closed reed portion of the waveform, and which portion represents the
open reed portion of the waveform?

Once you have answered the question directly, please provide a reference
on reading the oscilloscope wave patterns of musical instruments tones
to support your statement.

This is the "key stone" upon which you base your entire mouthpiece
volume theory.  The answer needs to come from you and referenced so that
the information can be verified by others.  You shouldn&#39;t take it
personally.  This is all about the quest for accurate and verifiable
scientific information, is it not?

 being equal, the simplest solution is usually the best.  The simple formula, X/2 + Y/2 = Z, which you seem to find incomprehensible, is not mine.  I didn&#39;t make it up out of the Blue.  It is the known formula for averaging ANYTHING - something we all learned in 6th grade.  If 10 chickens lay
 eggs, and they all lay a different amount of eggs, if we add all the eggs up and divide by the number of chickens, we get the average number of eggs per chicken.  Same thing here.  Add the volumes of the phases and divide by phases.   That&#39;s EXACTLY what Benade&#39;s EMV is. That&#39;s really mysterious!
  FMVR just adds the information that Benade left out.  The conical formula is the exact same thing, though it adds consideration for the fact that the duration of the "reed closed" phase is truncation ratio dependent - an absolutely essential element for an accurate averaging of the reality.  

I don&#39;t need to run this by anyone.  It is 6th grade math.

                                     Further:  The actual volume min/max range of the mouthpiece + reed does not change from a  cylindrical tube to a conical tube.  Only the average of the phases changes.  The midpoint.  That point in the range where the volume is most of the time, between the two
 extremes.  The ideal volume.  The most characteristic volume of the mouthpiece + reed under those  actual playing circumstances.

                                     Part II
  
  This section will prove that Benade&#39;s EMV, as calculated on a cylindrical tube, does not effectively apply to the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.
  
  Conical Tube Wave-form Cycle
  
  This formula describes the additive nature of the (fundamental) wave-form cycle of a sax mouthpiece on a conical tube.  It is identical to the first simple formula that was used for cylindrical tube wave-form cycles, but as is necessary for an accurate description of the Y phase, it includes  a
 factor for the truncation ratio.  The formula provides results identical to those of the cylindrical formula, using cylindrical data.  It is universally applicable for any mouthpiece/horn combination:
  
  X = + phase or Reed Open: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.
  Y = - phase or Reed Closed: duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick.
  Z = completed cycle: averaged, duration, equivalent length, or equivalent volume, take your pick, of X and Y.
  TR = truncation ratio: missing cone length/1/2 wave-length
  
  The Formula:
  
  X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z
  
  How do we get this formula?  The wave-form consists of 2 phases, X, Reed Open, is one of 2, or X/2.  The other one of 2
   consists of:
  
  1. Y or Reed Closed, for the length of TIME it takes sound to go the length of the missing cone (reed closed length)/the length of time it takes sound to go the length of the tube (1/2 wavelength), or the truncation ratio, or Y*TR/2, added to,
  
  2. X or Reed Open, for the remainder of the phase 1-TR (If the TR is .25, then the remainder of the phase is 1-.25, or .75.), or (X*(1-TR))/2.
  
  Add them together and you get Z. Simple again.
  
  Once again, given any mouthpiece, some tape, some water, and a cylindrical tube, we can easily find the actual closed, hard-walled volume, and Benade&#39;s Equivalent Volume, for the mouthpiece, and then plug that info into this formula.  We&#39;ll use John&#39;s EMV and MCV test for the played note,  F#1,
 on his SBA alto.  We have these known quantities:
  
  Reed Closed Volume: 6.87 ml.  We make this Y
  EMV: 9.13 ml.  This is Z
  The Reed Open volume (average): 11.39 We make this X
  Missing Cone Length (reed closed volume): The resonance which re-opens the reed exists in the "reed closed" phase of the wave-form cycle exclusively.  The length of a cone with a base radius of 6.3, and a volume of 6.87 ml is: Length = 3000*6.87/Pi* 6.3*6.3, Length = 165.29 mm
  Wave-length (F#1) 1570 mm
  1/2 wave-length: 785 mm
  TR: 165.29/785 = .21
  
  So we have:
  
  X/2 + (X*(1-TR))/2 + (Y*TR)/2 = Z
  
  Or:
  
  11.39/2 + (11.39*(1-.21) )/2 + (6.87*.21)/2 = Z
  
  Calculate
  
  5.695 + 4.499 + .721 = 10.915 ml
  
  Here are calculations for various notes based on John&#39;s SBA data:
  
  John&#39;s missing cone length of 213 mm: 5.965 + 0 + 3.435 = 9.13 ml
  F3 392.5 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 0.911 + 2.885 = 9.49 ml
  F2 785 mm wave -length :........... ...5.965 + 3.303 + 1.442 = 10.44 ml
  F1 1570 mm wave-length: ......... ......5.965 + 4.499 + 0.721 = 10.915 ml
  Bb0 2493 mm wave-length: ......... .....5.965 + 4.954 + 0.446 = 11.096 ml
  
  The purpose of Benade&#39;s EMV calculation using a cylindrical tube, is to establish the AVERAGE volume of the "Reed Open" Average and "Reed Closed" phases of the cycle for the mouthpiece.  It does a precise job, as the EMV remains constant over the playing range of a cylindrical tube of  varying
 lengths. The problem with applying Benade&#39;s EMV to a saxophone is, the reed compliance volume (the extra volume based upon the way the reed vibrates) of the mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube, bears no resemblance to the reed compliance volume of the same mouthpiece on a conical tube.   The reed
 vibrates differently on a conical tube.  The lower the note, the larger the average volume of the "Reed Open" and "Reed Closed" phases.  According to John&#39;s method, his saxophone requires a mouthpiece with 8.88 ml volume to work optimally, and though he claims his mouthpiece  matches that to
 within 1%, in actuality, according to the way the reed vibrates on a  conical tube,
   it varies from an error of 3.8% (too large) on F3, to 17.7% (too large) on low B, with a 12.5% (too large) error in the middle register.
  
  The solution: match the middle register, average volume, using the conical Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range formula, with the missing cone volume of your instrument, for optimal over-all response and intonation.   If playing baritone or bass and the low register is most prevalent, match the
 low  register average.
  
  I will be providing ongoing tests, comparative intonation charts and audio samples for each method, so readers can decide for themselves, what really works best, the numbers that don&#39;t line up, or the numbers that do.

 less sophisticated than the Virtins and again there is no similarity when I play your wave file into that either.

The contrary.  I assume that there are time-dependent effects -  A change in mouthpiece volume with a duration of x seconds, will affect any wave traveling toward the mouthpiece, within the range of distance traveled by the speed of sound in those x seconds, and any wave originating from the mouthpiece within those x seconds..  The bulk modulus of air and other considerations would certainly play a roll, however, in determining EMV (averaging the "reed open" and "reed closed" phases of the cycle via measuring the frequency of the cycle), Benade does not include any formulas other than those which calculate the length of a cylinder of a specific volume and diameter, and the time it takes sound to travel that distance.  Analysis of the actual wave-form, show my averaging calculations to be completely accurate, and further, they substantiate Benade&#39;s results.  If you accept Benade&#39;s method, FMVR should be accurate enough for our purposes.

Toby,

Present a challenge worthy of serious consideration in anything other than a snide tone, otherwise you waste your time, and mine.  Randomly stabbing in the dark and misconstruing known facts do not qualify. I&#39;ll help you out since it seems to be difficult for you. Here&#39;s what you have to do to prove me wrong.  It&#39;s childishly simple:

Show me that the fundamental pitch of ANY wave-form, is NOT the average of the durations of it&#39;s two phases.

If you can prove that, you got me.  I&#39;ll vanish forever.

 is much less sophisticated than the Virtins and again there is no similarity when I play your wave file into that either.

I repeat my offer.  Present a jpg. of the waveform you want to read.  My diagram is clearly labeled.  The only point which could be disputed is at which point the waveform starts - at the point where it crosses 0 amplitude, or at it&#39;s peak amplitude,  1/4 phase later.  Either way, the results will still be the same.  On this cylindrical air column, where the reed cycle is 50/50, one phase is shorter than the other.  The tube is effectively shorter for two entire lengths during the cycle.  What could possibly cause that?  What is the one changing element?

      Your most recent (non)response was entirely expected.  It is not that I don&#39;t believe that you labeled your diagram correctly.  I simply want to try to recreate your results using a clarinet mouthpiece on a barrel and a saxophone mouthpiece on a neck to make a comparison.



I simply don&#39;t have your experience (yet) with understanding waveforms as represented on an oscilloscope, hence my question which you continue to evade.

" Show me that the fundamental pitch of ANY wave-form, is NOT the

Each completed standing wave is 1 cycle.  Each cycle has two phases, a
compression and rarefaction.  The time it takes for 1 cycle (2 phases)
is 1 period.  The number of cycles in one second is the frequency.  The
frequency and period are reciprocals of one another.

From Lance&#39;s Study:

Fundamental pitch 858.37 Hz

duration of phase 1 "closed"    .510 ms
duration of phase 2 "open"      .655 ms
                              Total         1.165 ms

                         Average            .5825 ms

Frequency = 1/period              1/.0005825 s  =  1716.74 Hz

1716.74 Hz  does not equal  858.37 Hz   [B-)]

Let&#39;s see, what was the second part of Lance&#39;s comment?

Ha, ha, ha.  I meant to say actually is, the fundamental pitch is the average of the duration of each of it&#39;s two phases x 2, or theoretically extended into complete cycles of themselves, as per my study.  As complete cycles, you can clearly see how the volume of the fundamental is the average of the volumes of the two extended cycles, and thus, the average of the volume of each phase.  My mistake. I&#39;m outta here.

" Show me that the fundamental pitch of ANY wave-form, is NOT the average

Each completed standing wave is 1 cycle.  Each cycle has two phases, a compression and rarefaction.  The time it takes for 1 cycle (2 phases) is 1 period.  The number of cycles in one second is the frequency.  The frequency and period are reciprocals of one another.

From Lance&#39;s Study:

Fundamental pitch 858.37 Hz

duration of phase 1 "closed"    .510 ms
duration of phase 2 "open"      .655 ms
                             Total         1.165 ms

                        Average            .5825 ms

Frequency = 1/period              1/.0005825 s  =  1716.74 Hz

1716.74 Hz  does not equal  858.37 Hz  

Let&#39;s see, what was the second part of Lance&#39;s comment?

            <pre class='message__body'>What is it they always say?  "Pride goeth before a fall?"  Of course I know what you meant, but incorporated into your statement is the key to the flaw in your logic and reasoning. I inherently knew that there was something wrong with your study, but I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on it until you issued your challenge to Toby.  Now I see it clearly.  I&#39;ll let you stew on that one for a while.

Right now I am going to the local university to make copies of the Rockaboy and Gokhshtein studies that were referenced by Nederveen.  I have already found the one by Dalmont et.al. It is fantastic! 

It is unfortunate that there isn&#39;t more of a spirit of cooperation on this forum that might prompt me to share this research with others.  Oh well, "it is what it is", as they always say.

There is no flaw in the averaging theory, only my previous statement.  

The average of the durations/equivalent lengths/equivalent volumes of the two halves (2 phases) of any wave-form, asymmetrical or not, is exactly 50% the total duration, equivalent lenght, or equivalent volume of the complete wave-form cycle.  The average of the asymmetrical halves equals exactly 50% of the whole.  This is the essence of EMV.

      What is it they always say?  "Pride goeth before a fall?"  Of course I know what you meant, but incorporated into your statement is the key to the flaw in your logic and reasoning. I inherently knew that there was something wrong with your study, but I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on it until you issued your challenge to Toby.  Now I see it clearly.  I&#39;ll let you stew on that one for a while.



Right now I am going to the local university to make copies of the Rockaboy and Gokhshtein studies that were referenced by Nederveen.  I have already found the one by Dalmont et.al. It is fantastic! 



It is unfortunate that there isn&#39;t more of a spirit of cooperation on this forum that might prompt me to share this research with others.  Oh well, "it is what it is", as they always say.

I&#39;m outta here.

I&#39;ll help you out since it seems to be difficult for you. Here&#39;s what you have to do to prove me wrong.Ã‚Â  It&#39;s childishly simple:

            <pre class='message__body'>The "averaging" in Lance&#39;s "study" can be represented as follows:

2A + 2B divided by 2 = C

Where the Complete Cycle is "C", the Closed Phase is "A", and the Open
Phase is "B"

Doesn&#39;t that sound a lot like A + B = C ?  Of course it does, since the
duration of the completed wave is actually the sum of the duration of
its separate phases.  The so called "average" found by multiplying each
phase duration by two, adding them and then dividing by 2  is exactly
the same as just adding the duration of each phase with several
unnecessary steps added.

The flaw is not in the mathematical computations themselves, but in the
logic and reasoning behind the application of the results.  Not seeing
the forest for the trees is a kind way to say the same thing.

BTW I obtained the Rockaboy study, but will have to order the Gokhshtein
through library lending since the BYU Library did not have issues of the
Doklady Physics Journal going back that far.

course I know what you meant, but incorporated into your statement is
the key to the flaw in your logic and reasoning. I inherently knew that
there was something wrong with your study, but I couldn&#39;t quite put my
finger on it until you issued your challenge to Toby.  Now I see it
clearly.  I&#39;ll let you stew on that one for a while.

pitch is the average of the duration of each of it&#39;s two phases x 2, or
theoretically extended into complete cycles of themselves, as per my
study.ÃÂ  As complete cycles, you can clearly see how the volume of
the fundamental is the average of the volumes of the two extended
cycles, and thus, the average of the volume of each phase.ÃÂ  My
mistake. I&#39;m outta here.

phases, a compression and rarefaction.ÃÂ  The time it takes for 1
cycle (2 phases) is 1 period.ÃÂ  The number of cycles in one second
is the frequency.ÃÂ  The frequency and period are reciprocals of
one another.

            <pre class='message__body'>"The flaw is not in the mathematical computations themselves, but in the 
logic and reasoning behind the application of the results.  Not seeing 
the forest for the trees is a kind way to say the same thing."

The only flaw here is that  A + B = C is a seriously incomplete view of the reality, and insufficient for an understanding of the  nature of wave-form cycles, EMV, and FMVR.  Given the durations, or equivalent lengths, or equivalent volumes of the phases of the wave-form from my study (well use duration), A = 0.51 ms and B = 0.655 ms, John says that all we need to know is that,  0.51 + 0.655 = 1.165 ms, = 858.35 Hz = 402.39 mm = 91.33 ml, but you know what?  We don&#39;t know what the EMV is.  The wave travels 4 lengths of the tube in one cycle, so we can&#39;t figure it out (EMV) unless we do that thing that John says it so stupid to do - we have to divide.  Oh no!  If we divide 91.33 by 4, then we get the EMV = 22.81 ml.  Tah-Dah!, but we still don&#39;t see clearly how the equivalent volumes of each phase (A = 39.98 and B = 51.35) relate to that, since the wave travels 2 lengths of the tube for each phase.  Oh no!  We have to divide by 2 before we can
 see exactly how the difference in volume is affecting each 1/4 wave-length, and then we see that the EMV lies equidistant and between the minimal volume and the maximum (averaged) volume.

So you stick to your A + B = C,  John.  I&#39;ll dig a bit deeper, for a complete understanding if you don&#39;t mind.

A + B = C is the additive formula for waveforms.

X/2 + Y/2 = Z is the formula for EMV

These are 2 different things.  For our purposes, the latter is more important.

That&#39;s free information.

Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range Test and study the chart at the top

"X/2 + Y/2 = Z is the formula for EMV"

X is the value of the of the mouthpiece volume calculated using the
duration of the open mouthpiece phase times 2  as though it were a
complete wave in itself.

Y is the value of the mouthpiece volume calculated using the duration of
the closed mouthpiece phase times 2 as though it were a complete wave in
itself.

Z is the value of the mouthpiece volume calculated using the duration
(period) of the entire wave cycle.

Another way to represent this equation is X + Y = 2 Z  since X and Y are
the phase durations doubled.

Using small x and small y as the volume representing each phase found in
the wave cycle Z we get the following equation:

x + y = Z  which is still ADDITION.

In the next installment we will look at how Frequency is independent
from the durations of unequal phases in a completed wave cycle.  Stay
tuned (pun intended).

I have to admit John, you can read that chart.  If Sherlock Holmes were here, he would say that we certainly had a firm grasp on the obvious.  He would most likely add, that we had the uncanny ability to repeat insignificant details with great consistency, while ignoring, by some quality of oversight or less complimentary motives, those truly significant, and their implications.

If you bother yourself to consider the text explanation of the chart, you will see, it clearly states, 

"Theoretical
  full cycle info (as if that phase&#39;s volume remained constant for the 
entire
  cycle) is obtained from each phase&#39;s actual duration and
  provided for comparison.

The theoretical, full cycle projections of the actual phase durations, or 2A + 2B = , are provided merely for your convenience, so you can make a comparison of equivalent full cycles.  It is not part of the proof.  The proof lies in the actual, non-theoretical values of the chart (those that aren&#39;t labeled "theoretical) derived directly from real world measurements - the equivalent 1/4 wave length of the complete cycle for that respective phase (ie. 1/2 the actual phase) and equivalent volume.  This information provides us with X/2 + Y/2 = Z, where X = the equivalent volume of the "reed open" phase, Y = the equivalent volume of the "reed closed" phase and Z = the equivalent volume of the mouthpiece - Benade&#39;s EMV, that which we are after, or not?  True, Z is 1/2 an entire cycle, so the whole thing is equivalent to your A + B = C, but C does not equal EMV, and C explains nothing about the degree of asymmetry between the 1/4 wave-length tube length of
 a cylindrical bore nor the combined "reed closed"/"reed open" phase of a conical air column, so your whole diatribe, other than being a means to vent your obvious frustration, is meaningless.

A + B = C:  the duration of the phases add up to the duration of the cycle, regardless of how asymmetrical they are.  It is simple addition:

1 + 9 = 10
2 + 8 = 10
3 + 7 = 10
etc.

This is certainly enlightening.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have to admit John, you can read that chart.  If Sherlock Holmes were

I&#39;m glad that at least one of us does.

He would most likely add, that we had the uncanny ability to repeat
insignificant details with great consistency, while ignoring, by some
quality of oversight or less complimentary motives, those truly
significant, and their implications.

So called insignificant details become significant when they are
misinterpreted to form illogical and false conclusions.

The proof lies in the actual, non-theoretical values of the chart (those
that aren&#39;t labeled "theoretical) derived directly from real world
measurements - the equivalent 1/4 wave length of the complete cycle for
that respective phase (ie. 1/2 the actual phase) and equivalent volume.

This information provides us with  X/2 + Y/2 = Z,

Clearly a problem in Addition.  I thought your study was about
"averaging".

where X = the equivalent volume of the "reed open" phase,

X is derived from the 1/4 the wavelength of the "theoretical pitch" of
the "reed open" phase as though it were a complete cycle.  Since the
phase is actually ½ the theoretical complete cycle, that volume must
be divided by 2.

Y = the equivalent volume of the "reed closed" phase and

Y is derived from the 1/4 the wavelength of the "theoretical pitch" of
the "reed closed" phase as though it were a complete cycle.  Since the
phase is actually ½ the theoretical complete cycle that volume must
also be divided by 2.

Z = the equivalent volume of the mouthpiece - Benade&#39;s EMV, that which
we are after, or not?

The definition of "equivalent volume" as used by Benade is given in this
statement [FMA p. 466]   "In light of these facts, we can hope to
represent a reed and its mouthpiece cavity in terms of an equivalent
hard-walled cavity whose shape is chosen to make its acoustical effect
on the natural frequencies of an air column identical with the composite
effect of the actual reed-plus-cavity on the playing frequencies of the
air column.

True, Z is 1/2 an entire cycle,

Actually Z is an entire cycle, but let&#39;s move on.

So the whole thing is equivalent to your  A + B = C, but C does not
equal  EMV,

Pointless argument #1 - No one ever said it did.

and C explains nothing about the degree of asymmetry between the 1/4
wave-length tube length of a cylindrical bore nor the combined "reed
closed"/"reed open" phase of a conical air column,

Pointless argument #2 - No one ever said that it did that either.

So your whole diatribe, other than being a means to vent your obvious
frustration, is meaningless.

More juvenile insults and name calling to fill the void when intelligent
and meaningful arguments have run out.

From Lance&#39;s Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range Test Study.
"This study shows that what A. Benade terms as the "Effective Mouthpiece
Volume" of a saxophone mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube is actually the
exact average of the actual phase-dependent "reed open" and "reed
closed" volumes of the mouthpiece for each cycle of the waveform".

He calls it the "exact average".  It is  actually  the "sum" of the
average phase volumes as determined by his time domain calculations. 
This is significant in the fact that since the "additive nature of
(portions of ) wave forms" applies, then the resulting frequency will be
derived from the period of one complete wave cycle.  This is true
whether the phases of the wave cycle have a time domain ratio of 1:1, 2
: 1, 3 : 1, 3 :2, etc.

Summary
The frequency of a woodwind instrument is based upon the sum of the
durations of the phases of its cycle, not the average of those
durations.  It follows then that the ratio of the phases of a complete
waveform and any information derived from that ratio such as frequency,
wavelength, volume of a cylinder producing that frequency has no effect
upon the frequency.

This is the "sum" of my argument Lance.  (pun intended)

Ha, ha, ha.  If your insight into previous studies is any indication of what you could possibly hope to deny us by your refusal to report on these new documents, we stand to lose nothing and save a lot of time. 

Example #1:

"This information provides us with  X/2 + Y/2 = Z, 

Clearly
 a problem in Addition.  I thought your study was about "averaging"."

Really?  You are kidding right?  Averaging is comprised of 2 calculations:

1. adding the amounts of factors and 
2. dividing by the number of factors added.  

Let&#39;s go back to 6th grade then, since you forgot 6th grade math:

Chicken "Ex" lays X number of eggs.  Chicken "Why" lays Y number of eggs.

If we add the X number of eggs to the Y number of eggs, and divide by 2, we get the average number of eggs laid.

(X + Y)/2 = X/2 + Y/2 = Z or Average of X and Y.  

Example #2:

"X is derived from the 1/4 the wavelength of the "theoretical pitch" of 
the "reed open" phase as though it were a complete cycle.  Since the 
phase is actually ½ the theoretical complete cycle, that volume must be 
divided by 2."

 Totally wrong.  Data derived from theoretical data, in any quantity, is always labeled "Theoretical". Actual measurement data converted to other quantities, is termed "equivalent".  

X is the actual measured phase duration.  Y is the actual measured phase duration.  

Example #3:


"True, Z is 1/2 an entire cycle, 

Actually Z is an entire 
cycle..."

Totally wrong.  For the formula: X/2 + Y/2 + Z,  When X = the "reed open" duration or equivalent quantity, and Y = the "reed closed" duration or equivalent quantity, then X/2 = 1/4 wave-length, and Y/2 = 1/4 wave-length and Z equals the sum of the two, 1/4 wave-lengths, which is the average of the two (1/2 wavelength long) phases.  Z is exactly 50% of an entire cycle, which is directly related to EMV and the added reed compliance.

            <pre class='message__body'>Benade&#39;s numbered statements are a clear way to communicate.

1. Your value X is based upon the duration of the "open reed"
    wave phase doubled.  Your value Y is based upon the "closed reed"
    wave phase doubled.

2. Your theoretical pitch derived from wave phase is based upon those
    wave phases doubled as though each were a complete wave in itself.

3. Your theoretical wavelengths are based upon those wave phases
    doubled as well.

4. Your 1/4 cycle length is based upon those wave phases doubled.

5. Your mouthpiece equivalent volumes are calculated using the 1/4
    cycle lengths based upon those wave phases doubled.

6. When you use the formula  X/2 +  Y/2  =  Z  you are neglecting to
    realize that the values of X and Y are based upon the phase
    (approx.1/2 wave) values that have been doubled throughout.

7. Dividing each by 2 and then adding simply returns each to the
    initial phase value prior to being doubled.

8. Therefore in effect you are using addition---not averaging.


x = closed phase duration
y = open phase duration
Z = duration of complete wave cycle

x + y = Z

2x = X  - duration of phase as if it were a complete wave cycle by
itself.
2y = Y  - duration of phase as if it were a complete wave cycle by
itself.

Therefore:

X/2  +  Y/2  =  Z

I hope this is clear now.  I am tiring of this discussion of rudimentary
arithmetic.

"1. Your value X is based upon the duration of the "open reed"

Wrong.  Using my test info, X is based upon the actual duration of the "Reed Open" phase, 0.655 ms, during which the wave travels 2 lengths of the tube.  Y is based upon the actual duration of the "Reed Closed" Phase, 0.51ms, during which the wave travels 2 lengths of the tube.  NOTHING is doubled for proof calculations.

"2. Your theoretical pitch derived from wave phase is based upon those

This is totally irrelevant, since the theoretical numbers are not used for the proof.  They are provided for a comparison only.

"3. Your theoretical wavelengths are based upon those wave phases
   doubled as well."

This is totally irrelevant, since the theoretical numbers are 
not used for the proof.  They are provided for a comparison only.


"4. Your 1/4 cycle length is based upon those wave phases doubled."

Totally Wrong  The 1/4 cycle length is based upon 1/2  the actual duration of each phase of the actual (not theoretical - thus it is not labeled "theoretical") complete cycle.  Where each phase was X and Y, the 1/4 cycle is X/2 and Y/2.

X = 0.655 ms and Y = 0.51 ms

"5. Your mouthpiece equivalent volumes are calculated using the 1/4
  
 cycle lengths based upon those wave phases doubled."

Wrong.  The equivalent volumes are based upon 1/2 the actual phase durations of the actual cycle ( thus they are not labeled "theoretical"), or X/2 and Y/2

"6. When you use the formula  X/2 +  Y/2  =  Z  you are neglecting to
  
 realize that the values of X and Y are based upon the phase
   
(approx.1/2 wave) values that have been doubled
 throughout."

Wong.  X and Y have never been doubled for any proof calculation.  X = 0.655 ms and it&#39;s equivalent quantities.  Y = 0.51ms and it&#39;s equivalent quantities.

"7. Dividing each by 2 and then adding simply returns each to the
   
initial phase value prior to being doubled."

Wrong.  X and Y were never double for any proof computation.

Totally Wrong  The 1/4 cycle length is based  upon 1/2  the actual
duration of each phase of the actual (not  theoretical - thus it is not
labeled "theoretical") complete cycle.   Where each phase was X and Y,
the 1/4 cycle is X/2 and Y/2.

Sorry  Lance.  What you are missing is the fact that regardless of
whether you  are treating the open reed phase as a half cycle and saying
X/2 equals  1/4 wavelength or that the open reed phase is a whole cycle
and X/4  equals 1/4 wavelength, you are still treating your  phase as
though it were a complete wave which it is not.

That  means that when you arrive at your 112.99 mm 1/4 wavelength and
its  corresponding 25.65 ml volume, you have still treated the open reed
phase duration of the cycle as though it were a complete wave cycle in 
itself.  Therefore when that value is divided by 2 you are converting it
back to its original phase (not complete wave) value.

X =  0.655 ms and Y = 0.51 ms

Here are the calculations where X  was never double for any proof
computations as you claim

X =  .655 ms = .000655 s

F = 1/.000655 = 1526.72 Hz

Wavelength  = 345000 mm/s / 1526.72 = 225.97 mm

1/4 Wavelength = 225.97 / 4 =  56.49 mm*

Equivalent volume = 3.1416 x 8.5 sq x 56.49 =  12.822 ml

Here are the calculations where X is double for the  computations

X = .655 ms

2X = 1.31 ms

F =  1/.00131 = 763.36 Hz

Wavelength = 345000 mm/s / 763.36 = 451.95  mm

1/4 Wavelength = 451.95 / 4 = 112.99  mm

Equivalent volume = 3.1416 x 17 sq x 112.99 = 25.65  ml

* You can argue that you only  divided by 2 here to get 112.99 mm
instead of 56.49 mm, however that  simply takes you to the X is double
value, does it not?

When the equivalent volumes for the open and  closed reed phases that
have  been calculated as though each were a  complete wave in itself 
are divided by 2---those values revert back to  the volumes that would
be produced by each phase alone. Therefore when  adding those volumes
divided by 2 it is a function of addition and not  averaging.

4  +  10   =  14  the sum of 4 and 10

8/2   +  20/2  =  14  the sum of 4 and 10 also the average  of 8 and 20
which are 4 and 10 doubled.

Please  entertain the idea that you just might be wrong on this one
Lance,  because you are.  I am trying to do you a favor in pointing out
the  flaws in your logic and conclusions, so that you won&#39;t waste your 
time  in the future with theories and ideas based on this false
information.

            <pre class='message__body'>Amazing thought process, but, here are the calculations that I made for my proof:


X = 0.655ms (actual measured duration)
0.000655 * 345400 = 226.23 mm (actual distance traveled by wave during phase)
pi * 8.5 *8.5 * 226.23 = 51.35 ml (actual equivalent volume of 17mm diameter tube 226.23mm long)
X/2 = 25.65 ml (equivalent volume of actual 1/4 "reed open" tube length, 1st averaging calculation)

Y= .0.51 ms (actual measured duration)
0.00051 * 345400 = 176.15 mm (actual distance traveled by wave during 
phase)

pi * 8.5 *8.5 * 176.15 = 39.98 (actual equivalent volume of 17mm 
diameter tube 176.15mm long)

Y/2 = 19.97 ml (equivalent volume of actual 1/4 "reed closed" tube length and actual, water method measured, hard-walled mouthpiece volume, 1st averaging calculation)


25.65 + 19.97 = 45.62 ml (2nd averaging calculation = average of actual 51.35 ml and 39.98 ml phase equivalent volumes, 50% of actual asymmetrical cycle)

45.62 / 2 = 22.81 ml average 1/4 wave-length equivalent volume of actual asymmetrical cycle AND Benade&#39;s EMV for my mouthpiece.

So, actually I did make one little error.

X/2 + Y/2 = Z (average cycle value = 50% of asymmetrical wave-form)

Z/2 = average 1/4 wave-length volume = Benade&#39;s EMV for my tubeless mouthpiece.  With a tube, we still need to subtract the known tube volume.

This also gives us

22.81 (average 1/4 wl volume) - 19.97 (reed closed volume) = 2.84 ml
25.65 (average reed open volume*) - 22.81 (average 1/4 wl volume) = 2.84

22.81 +/- 2.84 ml: Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range (average max)

X/2 (unknown max volume/2) + 19.97/2 (known minimum/2) = 25.65 (average max)

X + 19.97 = 51.3

X = 31.33 ml (actual max reed open volume)

31.33 - 22.81 = 8.52 ml

22.81 ml + 8.52lm/-2.84 ml: Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range (actual max)

One could also just go:

X + Y = Z 

Z / 4 = average 1/4 wave-length volume = Benade&#39;s EMV for my tubeless 
mouthpiece,
but I can make good use of the range info, and I intend to demonstrate, with the conical tube EMV tests, that cylindrical tube EMV does not apply to conical tubes and that this information is essential to optimally matching a mouthpiece to an instrument.

Correction.  Actually, that is: 

8.52 ml = max open volume
19.97 ml = minimum volume
8.52 - 2.84 = 5.68

22.81 ml +5.68/-2.84 ml = Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range (actual max, cylindrical tube)

Come on Lance, one little error?  Your entire study was presented as proof beyond a doubt that the mouthpiece volume of the complete wave is the average of the volumes of the separate phases of that wave.  That has turned out to be absolutely false as I have demonstrated time and time again.

That means that the second part of your study that the frequency of a conical instrument is dependent upon the ratio of the reed open and reed closed phases because of their different mouthpiece volumes is false as well.

That is not one little error. That is the entire study that lacks validity.  If there is no averaging that means the whole is the sum of its parts, not the average.  If the equivalent mouthpiece volume is the sum and not the average of the volume calculated from each phase of the wave, it follows that the ratio or proportion of those phases to the entire wave cycle has no effect upon the resulting frequency.  Said frequency is derived from the sum of the wavelengths of each phase.

You are not fooling anyone but yourself by continuing this line of reasoning based upon your fatally flawed mouthpiece equivalent volume averaging study.  Please admit your mistake and move on.

Wrong again John.  

My study states, 

"This
  study shows that what A. Benade terms as the "Effective Mouthpiece
  Volume", of a saxophone mouthpiece on a cylindrical tube*, is
  actually the
  exact average of the actual phase-dependent, "reed open" and
  "reed closed" volumes of the mouthpiece, for each cycle of the
  waveform."

Actually, my study shows that Benade&#39;s Effective Mouthpiece Volume is directly proportional to the exact average of the actual phase-dependent, "reed open" and
  "reed closed" volumes of the mouthpiece, for each cycle of the
  waveform, 1/2 that amount, or the average of the 1/4 asymmetrical wavelengths.  My conclusions regarding cylindrical and conical tube are just as valid, and I have every intention of demonstrating them.  

I certainly understand your reluctance that I continue, as my empirical conical tube results stand to prove your preaching, invalid, as the mathematical proof, already has.

      I will soon present the revised study showing that Benade&#39;s Equivalent Mouthpiece Volume is  the average of the equivalent volumes of the 1/4, asymmetrical wave-lengths, of a mouthpiece on a conical tube, minus the known tube volume.  The importance of knowing the Functional Mouthpiece Volume Range will be explained.   Further, I will include the application of this proof and FMVR, mathematically to the same mouthpiece on a conical tube, to show that the EMV is inversely proportional to the truncation ratio, and as such, an ineffective means to match a mouthpiece to an instrument.  Empirical conical tube tests will be performed and documented to confirm these predictions.

      I refuse to argue with you any longer.  Believe what you will.  I have

given empirical mathematical proof that your so called "averaging" is

bogus in several different ways and yet you continue with your charade.

Your credibility is zero at this point as far as I am concerned.  Saving

face and protecting one&#39;s ego apparently take precedence over scientific

accuracy and logical conclusions.

But some careful measurements and analysis should answer the question better than conjecture has been doing.

Right, but everything is a matter of degree.  As Dalmont says, we can manage inharmonicity in the low register easier than in the higher registers, and the wanna-be dominant f2 of low B, for example, can be tamed by making small adjustments in the neck at a node if needed..  

The point is, you can make more out of matching your mf EMV to the missing cone than just using a "middle of the road" setting, so to speak.   Though that might be just fine for most players, there are certainly players that take advantage of it, knowingly or not.  Here we could go back to my old discussion of Pete Christlieb and his 160/whatever Berg.  With a mouthpiece that open and a soft reed, you have a lot of control over a huge range of reed compliance.

the reed compliance varies 2ml over the range of my tenor, lower register compliance is larger than the high register

That is very interesting Lance.  How did you measure that?

            <pre class='message__body'>Coupla things. First, the neck taper anyway changes at the cork, becoming almost cylindrical, if not actually cylindrical, for the last inch or so. Some makers "neck in" to improve the tuning of the upper register as well. The curve of the neck also changes the taper, so there is no continuous
 neck taper to begin with.

Second, since there is no standardization between makers, there is no way for mpc makers to design their mpcs for a specific taper/neck.

I think you will find that mpc volumes are all over the place, and of course saves us is the fact that we can move the mpc on the neck.

 mouthpiece.  So the mouthpiece volume would be based on the neck taper.  The body taper is not ignored in that the neck taper is determined by it.  Similar, but tweaked.  
 
 But some careful measurements and analysis should answer the question better than conjecture has been doing.

 Of course.  As Dalmont states, the conicity of the upper tube affects the shorter wave-lengths more than the longer wave-lengths. I can&#39;t think of a reason not to attempt satisfy both requirements. Ignoring the body which is the core of the instrument, is silly I think.

Since you brought it up, I would like to have acoustic benefits of the  
stones explained in terms I can understand. I&#39;ve examined some of the  
necks with the stone inserts, and the stone itself has very little  
mass. I&#39;ve played numerous examples of the horns in question from this  
maker and frankly can&#39;t tell the difference in stone vs. non-stone  
examples....they look different and that appears to be all. There are  
some acoustic claims being made for these stones, and I would like to  
know if there is anything to back this up other than the  
manufacturer&#39;s claims.

We do add weights to specific points of some of our necks. The amount  
of mass we add is significant. We find the addition of mass to  
pressure node points significantly influences the response of specific  
notes. This mass is added directly to the neck tube, not on a "collar"  
at the tenon.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is a very fascinating topic in the area of acoustics---whether or not changes to the outside of the body tube can measurably or perceptively change the vibrating air column inside the instrument.  To date there have been no scientific studies that have found this to be true.  That said, there is lots of anecdotal evidence that some players perceive there is a difference in different metals, finishes, brace locations, etc.

I would like to know the names of the notes on a tenor sax whose "pressure nodes" are at the location of the added brass weights to your specially designed neck.  I would also like you to share with us which specific notes whose "response" is significantly affected by adding mass at these points.

            <pre class='message__body'>I was first introduced to the concept of external weights by Jim  
Schmidt about a dozen years ago. Jim had a couple of horns with  
weights all over the bodies. I didn&#39;t play the horns before the  
weights were applied, so I can&#39;t speak as to any difference. Jim is a  
REAL mad scientist type, who is not afraid to try new ideas, and I  
always listen to what he has to say and have great faith in his  
findings. He has done some very interesting stuff over the years.

We experimented a great deal with different mass weights and different  
locations and learned some interesting stuff. In truth, some of the  
necks we built up that played the best were simply to ugly to sell.

I&#39;ve put up a great many neck demo videos on my saxgourmetproducts  
(one word) YouTube site, so anyone who is interested can check them  
out. Insofar as revealing the actual math, I&#39;ll pass on that  
opportunity, since I don&#39;t wish to do my competitors R&D for them!

I&#39;m currently working on some necks as a joint venture with my friend  
Rheuben Allen. These necks have some pretty large weights which can be  
moved and arranged in different configurations. The different  
configurations give different sounds. You can see some pictures at
http://saxophonethoughts.blogspot.com/  Rheuben has been fooling with  
this concept for about a year, and I&#39;ve been experimenting with  
different configurations of his product. He and I also have several  
joint ventures underway currently which involve different  
manufacturing techniques for necks which eliminate braces, seams, and  
the like. We&#39;re developing a neck that is a continuous, seamless tube,  
from tip to tenon.

            <pre class='message__body'>With all due respect, no one has asked for "the math" as you call it. 
Your statement in your first post was:

"We find the addition of mass to pressure node points significantly
influences the response of specific notes."

Since you are publicly making this claim, I am simply asking you which
notes "pressure node points" you believe are found in the location of
the tenor sax neck where you have added the three brass ovals and which
specific notes have an improved response.  Believe me that there is no
one on this forum who wants to "steal" your "R&D " and compete with you.
That is absurd.  I am simply asking you to expand upon your claim by
giving some  specifics about the pitches affected by adding mass at
these points.

Any additional insight into how and why adding mass at pressure node
points affects the vibrating air column inside the tube would be most
welcome as well.

            <pre class='message__body'>Almost no manufacturing companies of which I am aware share  
proprietary technology and research with the public. I see no reason  
our company should be treated any differently. We have stated benefits  
that we have discovered, and that is as far as we see any need to go.  
We are a privately held company, and have no obligation whatsoever to  
public disclosure of confidential information. I see no reason that  
anyone needs to know the particulars of or benefit from our research.  
If we had wished to make the particulars public, we would most likely  
have done so in one of my regular articles on saxophone design which  
appear in each and every issue of The Saxophone Journal.

We believe we have adequately demonstrated the benefits of our design  
through the public publication of numerous product videos. I see no  
reason this should not suffice. This is FAR more information than any  
other manufacturer provides. We do a LOT of experimentation, as anyone  
who has visited our prototype shop will attest. Most of what we try  
does not work, and that is useful information to us. The innovations  
that do prove successful often find their way onto our products which  
we offer for sale. Since research and experimentation comes at a  
significant financial cost to us, we elect not to do it on behalf of  
the competition! I don&#39;t get a lot of calls from Peter Ponzol, Oleg  
Garbozov, Karsten Gloger and others saying "Hey, Steve, I just figured  
out something that works. Here are the specifics, you should use it on  
your necks!".

I note with interest that other neck manufacturers do not provide  
specific information on their designs, and see no reasonable reason  
why we should be called upon to do so, particularly in light of the  
fact that we provide infinitely more public information about our  
products than any of our competitors. We state the general principles  
we discover and demonstrate them to the public, which is more than  
anyone else does.

conclusive study to date involving thin walled reed instruments and is
directly on point to this discussion which is the  effects of wall

I think it is also important to note the distinction between the solid

conical woodwinds such as saxophones.

A veritable gold mine of Gilbert&#39;s published studies can be found at

                                    We find that a seamless tube resonates better...... we&#39;re still fooling around with different materials and manufacturing techniques, since we will be, in the grand scheme of things, producing them in significant quantity. The biggest issue we are having with
 this design currently is a high "scrap rate" when using solid silver. We will figure that out in time. Sharon and I are going across the Great Waters to the West pretty soon in order to spend some time at the various factories we deal with and to see if we can figure out some solutions to this
 problem and develop some new products. The factories all have equipment we lack at our prototype shop, so the experiments can go quicker over there. We&#39;ll also have some experienced saxophone builders to assist us. When I build things here, I have to do it all myself!

This is the most conclusive study to date involving thin walled reed instruments and is directly on point
 to this discussion which is the  effects of wall vibrations on the vibrating air column inside the instrument.

I think it is also important to note the distinction between the solid tube brass wind instruments and the tone hole lattice thin walled conical woodwinds such as saxophones.

A veritable gold mine of Gilbert&#39;s published studies can be found at this link.  Joel Gilbert   Enjoy.

If you ever find yourself in Beijing try giving me a call and we can go have a beer somewhere. My China cell is 13699147722. I am only in China six months of the year though, and I am often traveling, so it will be hit or miss, but you can give it a try if you want.

products manufactured in three different Asian countries and seven  
different factories within those countries. Sharon has never been to  
China, and wishes to do a bit of sight seeing, and we plan to  
participate in the Shanghai Music Fair on behalf of our Asian  
distributor, Bejingmusco. We will also be looking for new vendors and  
products.

The main purpose of our visit is to avail ourselves of the  
manufacturing resources available at some of the larger factories.  
They have equipment we don&#39;t have in New Orleans, and some highly  
skilled technicians who can help us construct some prototypes quickly.

I&#39;m not sure how many of the 100 billion neurons in the human brain are involved with playing the saxophone.  There are 100 million in the auditory cortex alone.  I think an accomplished player makes playing close to a full-body experience.  That&#39;s a lot of information being input every few microseconds.  Besides auditory input, the player is able to discern through the "feel" of actual playing a real saxophone, differences which might not make themselves apparent, using a simplified test "axe" and an artificial embouchure/blowing machine.  What a player experiences, not a laboratory study, is, in the end, the player&#39;s reality. 

More controlled player tests needed.

      The player may very well experience the vibrations of the neck/mouthpiece in contact the top teeth up through the skull to the auditory canal.  That&#39;s part of the reason that we sound different on a recording than when we hear ourselves live.  That has nothing to do with the actual sound that is transmitted to the listener.

Vague anecdotal accounts by unnamed players who supposedly claim to be able to tell a difference when mass is added to or removed from the neck does not constitute "evidence" by any definition of the word.

Why not make a recording with the weights on the neck, then quickly unsolder them and make another recording of the same player, same set-up and music being played?

Better yet record long tones throughout the range of the saxophone at several different dynamic levels with and without the brass weights installed and compare the spectrographs of the identical notes played at identical dynamic levels by the same player.

This would not be conclusive evidence by any means, but it would carry a lot more credibility than vague, unsupported, anonymous anecdotal remarks repeated by someone who has an obvious bias and financial interest in the matter.

            <pre class='message__body'>"To say that adding (or taking away) mass at various locations on the

Despite what you imply, the degree of resonance harmonicity or
inharmonicity, is not the only factor which can affect the way an
instrument plays.  Turbulence and damping effects can make an
instrument difficult, or even impossible to play. 

Though you say you know what I am talking about (the importance of the player&#39;s physical perception of the instrument&#39;s response) you continue to suggest making A/B recordings as audio listening tests as a means to demonstrate these differences.  I still fail to see how making audio recordings can convey my impressions of the physical sensation of playing an instrument.  Only a player will know what I&#39;m talking about.

As Benade advised, the player can readily discern microscopic (0.XX mm) changes in the dimensions of an instrument - upper bore, sharp edges, etc, and these are things that more often than not, only the player will be aware of.  Gibiat reported the negative effects of wall vibrations in a saxophone bell.  I personally heard the great American woodwind performer and educator, Russell Howland, recount his own experience with wall vibrations in the bottom bow of a saxophone - how adding mass to the outside of the bow stabilized the tone.  I would attribute these cases and the rest of what I am concerned about, to turbulence and resultant amplitude loss, rather than wall vibration, coupling induced, harmonicity effects.   Since the f1 resonance is already weak in the saxophone&#39;s low register, any turbulence induced amplitude loss can render the low register unplayable.  Any amplitude loss in any regime resonance will alter the tone, response, and
 possibly the pitch of that note.

Since 99% of the input energy is lost to thermal and viscous effects, from the start, I  consider any condition, which could possibly contribute to even the slightest further loss, even if not clearly audible to the listener, to be worthy of serious consideration.  That&#39;s just me, as a player, talking, but the history of the development of these instruments shows us that, for the most part, their refinement was a process of many small and sometimes, seemingly insignificant changes, based upon empirical considerations, rather than those scientific.

I&#39;m not following your logic and reasoning here Lance.  What are you
claiming the cause of turbulence to be?  How does this relate to the
discussion of the effects of adding mass or thickness to the outside of
the tube?

Thanks Steve, I believe I will.  It would be a simple matter to use one of your photographs to gauge the dimensions and scale of the brass weights to make them from brass stock and to solder them to a used neck in the same locations.  This would be a perfect test for my artificial embouchure device to remove the variable of the human player and to compare the spectrographs with and without the weights.  Its too bad you won&#39;t indicate which notes you think have pressure nodes in that area so we could focus on those notes, but I can figure that out mathematically on my own.  You can rest assured they are not the same as those in Ferron&#39;s pictures which you have distributed for years. I still have the one you passed out at your clinic in Cleveland in my notebook.  You know the one where we sat at the same table with the Getzen brothers for dinner and discussed saxophone warbles and the venturi effect as it applies to saxophones.

I think there is a point where spelling things out becomes ridiculous.  

Surely you are aware that the horn body vibrates during playing.  Surely you know that an uncoupled vibrating surface will cause the air next to it to vibrate as well, and that air movement will be perpendicular to the surface, and out of phase with the wave that generated the vibration.  Any air molecule motion which is not coupled with the laminar flow of
the wave is turbulence.  Two traveling waves (1. the regime wave and 2.
the turbulence)* which exist in the same medium will interfere with
each other.  This is known as the Interference of Sound.

I do not believe that wall vibration can be heard by the listener, but it is conceivable that the player may notice the effects of it interfering with the regime wave to some degree.

"Although the fluid-structure interactions in wind instruments are weak, the vibrations of the walls, no matter their origin, may then induce sound radiation in the surrounding external or internal fluid."

"The radiation to the internal fluid may induce a perturbation of the oscillations of the air column and thus disturb indirectly the radiated field."

I thought theoretical discussions involved actually thinking about things, as opposed to limiting oneself to reading and reciting the printed words from a page of text, sine intellectus. :-)

snide remarks Lance.  You might want to try that some time.

Repeating your quotes with added emphasis:

"Although the fluid-structure interactions in wind instruments are weak,
the vibrations of the walls, no matter their origin, may then induce
sound radiation in the surrounding external or internal fluid."

"The radiation to the internal fluid may induce a perturbation of the 
oscillations of the air column and thus disturb indirectly the radiated 
field."

The rest of the study makes it very clear that  "in order to obtain a
measurable effect, the tested tube has to be very thin (.2 mm) and
slightly oval shaped which is not realistic for a wind instrument".
[Gilbert&#39;s exact words in quotes]

In his conclusions he writes:

"An artificial oval shaped and thin walled system has been constructed
for these effects to be measurable.  For real orchestral instruments, 
although the previously described mechanism is not to be excluded
completely for a particular instrument,  similar effects are thus
unlikely to be measurable and, even if they were, would only occur for
one or a few notes."

My point here is this.  It is perfectly acceptable for one to create a
theory or hypothesis based upon referenced factual scientific
information.  However, said theory or hypothesis should be clearly
stated as such so as not to be construed as actual scientific
fact---which it is not until it has been proven scientifically.

"I do not believe that wall vibration can be heard by the listener, but it is conceivable that the player may notice the effects of it interfering with the regime wave to some degree."

While Gilbert&#39;s study is interesting and seems to be primarily concerned with what could affect the tone color of the sound produced, I don&#39;t think it provides the slightest insight into what is or is not noticeable to the accomplished player as "feel" when playing a real saxophone in the real world.

I&#39;m inclined to place more trust in my own, immeasurably more sophisticated, sensitive, and refined bio-testing mechanism, when evaluating or comparing the tonal, dynamic, and responsive characteristics of any real saxophone.

I see absolutely nothing unscientific about JS&#39;s "Materials" test.  He did state that it is intended for the trained ear. Test results from more players would be interesting, but I find no reason to discount his results. 

The Coltman publication states that, "The acoustically important dimensions of all three instruments were then identical within 0.01 cm."  That&#39;s 0.004".  Flutes and mouthpieces today are machined to within 0.002" or less in critical areas.  I use 0.005" brass sheet to make resonators.  It&#39;s not so thin that it doesn&#39;t exist.

I was waiting for Toby to field this one.  For starters Jim Schmidt who has an obvious bias to begin with did both the playing and the listening part of the test himself.  It is also highly likely that even though he was blindfolded and used one hand to hold the headjoint to his lip that he could detect a different feel in the "swing" of weighted flute versus the lighter one.

For Schmidt&#39;s test to have any scientific validity, it would need to be duplicated with several professional flutists playing the apparatus with a panel of experienced listeners in a series of double blind tests with a large enough number of trials to determine statistically the validity and accuracy of the responses. 

Also adding a large and unnatural weight to the end of a thin walled flute can hardly be compared to making the entire body of the flute out of a thicker or denser metal making the conclusion of the study as flawed as the methodology.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I was in the Philippines working my butt off, with no internet. 

I corresponded directly with Jim about this, and it was I who pushed him to try a blindfold test. I also criticized his results for the same reason that John mentions. Jim said that he could detect a difference four out of five times in his blindfold test with suspended flute. This alone seems to
 indicate that the differences were not large to begin with. After he published his results, 

I wrote to him that to be more rigorous, he had to clamp the flute in a way that he could not swing it, as subtle weight differences are a big tipoff. I told him that I was pretty sure that if he removed weight clues he would no longer be able to tell the instruments apart. Jim said that he would
 redo the test as I suggested and revise his results. I believe that the fact that he did not do so is significant.

Toby
