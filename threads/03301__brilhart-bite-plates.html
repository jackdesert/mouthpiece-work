            <pre class='message__body'>I have run into the bite plate  problem too, and have had luck with two 
solutions.  First, filling the tooth indents with epoxy before applying 
the toothguard worked well. Secondly, as shown in the pictures section

hacksaw, then epoxied it in place on the Brilhart. Works great. JimG

            <pre class='message__body'>This is old news, but I bring it up again: many epoxies contain very nasty stuff as plasticizers (Bisphenol A, for example) which are not nice for the body and which leach out in the presence of saliva. It is advisable to use only epoxies that are intended for use in plumbing, for example, or dental epoxies, on any part of the mpc that comes in contact with the mouth.

            <pre class='message__body'>Just for the record I note that Jim always covered the epoxy--either with a toothguard or a piece of plastic, which would limit exposure. When you can get away with it superglue is a better choice, however, as it is completely inert after it has set. It&#39;s harder to fill in gaps with it, but the gum type is not so bad with repeated applications.
