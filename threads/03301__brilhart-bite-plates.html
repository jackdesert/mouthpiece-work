This is old news, but I bring it up again: many epoxies contain very nasty
stuff as plasticizers (Bisphenol A, for example) which are not nice for the
body and which leach out in the presence of saliva. It is advisable to use
only epoxies that are intended for use in plumbing, for example, or dental

            <pre class='message__body'>Just for the record I note that Jim always covered the epoxy--either with a toothguard or a piece of plastic, which would limit exposure. When you can get away with it superglue is a better choice, however, as it is completely inert after it has set. It&#39;s harder to fill in gaps with it, but the gum type is not so bad with repeated applications.
