One thing I have done, to experiment, was to drip candle wax into the
chamber.  Then carve this to shape.  It is more stable than chewing
gum... Hah!  Then experiment with shapes, contours.  If I went too far,
a few more drips of wax.  When I had a likely good shape (or not) I
would just chip out the wax and start again with epoxy putty.

  You betchum, Red Ryder!  Bring on the epoxy putty! 
  One thing I have done, to experiment, was to drip candle wax into the chamber.  Then carve this to shape.  It is more stable than chewing gum... Hah!  Then experiment with shapes, contours.

       Certainly right on the mark, Phil!  That is why I suggested we do as is suggested by John Winslow, and use some student model pieces, inexpensive, yet good players to start with.  Then experiment to find our for ourselves what change has what effect.  Constant working and playing is the only way to learn this. 
      I turned a lot of good mouthpieces into junk before I started to get some results.  But this was working in a vacuum... no internet help 30 years ago.

  Removing material... Well, once removed it is gone... I have made tools from dowels, with sandpaper glued on, have a number of files of different shapes.  Some great tools for this at www.micromark.com. 
  What do you use?

       You betchum, Red Ryder!  Bring on the epoxy putty! 
      One thing I have done, to experiment, was to drip candle wax into the chamber.  Then carve this to shape.  It is more stable than chewing gum... Hah!  Then experiment with shapes, contours.  If I went too far, a few more drips of wax.  When I had a likely good shape (or not) I would just chip out the wax and start again with epoxy putty.

           Certainly right on the mark, Phil!  That is why I suggested we do as is suggested by John Winslow, and use some student model pieces, inexpensive, yet good players to start with.  Then experiment to find our for ourselves what change has what effect.  Constant working and playing is the only way to learn this. 
          I turned a lot of good mouthpieces into junk before I started to get some results.  But this was working in a vacuum... no internet help 30 years ago.

            <pre class='message__body'>One good putty to use to experiment with is poster hanging putty.  It 
goes by names such as Sticky-Tack (SP?) and DAP Fun Tak.  I have the 
DAP stuff.  I use it to try out baffle shapes.  It fights you a 
little while molding it and it sometimes does not want to stick, but 
it is teporary and comes out easy.  

After you get a shape you like, remove it and roll it up in a ball to 
estimate how much epoxy you will need.  I find this easier than 
making an oversized baffle and filing it to the final shape.

There are many epoxies out there to choose from.  Some are putties 
some are glues.  If you let the glues set up some, you can use them 
like putties.  I&#39;ve used a lot of Atlas Plumber&#39;s Epoxy and some JB 
Weld (for small repairs) and Ferree&#39;s Jet black.  Lately I&#39;ve been 
trying Oatley Epoxy Putty.  It is a white bar with a black core.  It 
is a fast set Epoxy (5 min).  You need to work fast, but I like it 
better than having to wait.

I notice there are some interesting putties, and other rubber and
plastic molding materials in the Micromark catalog.  I would like to
experiment with these in the future.  Yeah, I&#39;ll work that in somewhere
in my schedule... LOL!

Mojo - great idea to start this group.  I perused a few of the message 
threads, and I&#39;d like to say thanks to Phil Barone for his insights and 
candor.
