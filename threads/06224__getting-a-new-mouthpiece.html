            <pre class='message__body'>I was thinking of getting an Amati C Clarinet.  I want to get a Pyne or 
Pomarico crystal mouthpiece for that C Clarinet.  I&#39;ve been told by the 
music company that a regular Bb Clarinet mouthpiece would suffice but 
I"m unsure about this.

I don&#39;t know what is meant by the tip and facing on a mouthpiece.  I 
want to get the best on that I have. 

To let you know my personal tastes in mouthpieces, I have a 5RV for my 
Eb Clarinet and a Pyne for my Bb Clarinet.  I want to make sure that I&#39;m 
getting the best for my C Clarinet now.

Please help and advise.
