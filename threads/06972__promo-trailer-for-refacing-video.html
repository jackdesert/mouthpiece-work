            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve got the first cut of our promotional trailer for the soon to be
released (at last) mouthpiece refacing video available. It doesn&#39;t have the
final graphics and is in a low resolution Windows Media file type to keep
size down. I&#39;ll be happy to send you a copy (which has scenes from the
actual video) if you will request one OFF THIS FORUM by emailing me (so I
can insert the file and hit "reply") at

The Music Business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs. There&#39;s
