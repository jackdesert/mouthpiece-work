            <pre class='message__body'>I love Perspex. It goes back to the second world war or earlier as it
was used  for aircraft canopies, motorcycle windshields etc. It was
used for childrens toys before plastic, female display busts for
garments, smokey covers on record decks, Selmer barrels, Grafton alto,
an unknown make of completely transparent tenor sax, protective
screens on oscilloscopes.............
It tends to bloom with UV light when used as secondary glazing. 
Can be bent in boiling water. Dissolved in Acetone to make a DIY nail
varnish.
Today it is used to front CD cases. I used a cutting for my first
Glass Gauge but it was too flexible and gave innacurate readings.
It cuts and drills easily but cracks under pressure.
I use 1/8 or 1/4" thick for removable baffles which shape easily with
a file.
It should make nice bite plates in it&#39;s various colours. 
I have a Lucite clarinet piece by Gretsch which, though used, shows no
teeth marks.
