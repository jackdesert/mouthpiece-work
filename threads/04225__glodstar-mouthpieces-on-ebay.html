            <pre class='message__body'>If you like the Glodstar, you will like the DM Sharkbite  even better.
This Chinese mouthpiece is of similar design and obviously from the same
factory.
The rails and tip are hand finished and better than the Glodstar. It is
brass, 1/8" shorter and has a slightly higher baffle.
  The table seems to be a problem on both, with a hump in the middle -
lengthwise.
Any suggestions as to the best way to tackle this problem would be
appreciated..............Eddie
