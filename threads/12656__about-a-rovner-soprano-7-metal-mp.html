            <pre class='message__body'>This Rovner MP came with a soprano saxophone I bought on the dutch variant of ebay. It looks as if the beak is modified near the tip. Am I right? It also looks as if the curve of the tip is a litle bit damaged. Is not a percect curve anymore. What to do about that?

            <pre class='message__body'>That mouthpiece has been dropped on the floor, not modified.  I have repaired this kind of 
damage a number of times.

The tip would have to be refaced, and the baffle filed in that area to match the rest of the 
baffle.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for reacting, I am afraid you both are right but also that the previous owner tried to repair it by filing the beak only. That is why the beak looks like this near the tip.  That also means that fixing is more difficult. I can not hammer the dent back, it is already gone. 
 I think this is going to be my first refacing job.
 

 What is the right sequence for this particular job?
 - filing the facingcurve until the tipcurve is normal again (this will result in a bigger tipopening)
 - filing the baffle if necessary
 - filing the beak as little as possible (I am afraid it removes the gold layer)
 - lowering the table to achieve an normal tipopening again
 - checking the facing
 - sanding and polishing

            <pre class='message__body'>Check out the files area on the Yahoo Group site.  There are a lot of resources including a list of steps that can be considered for refacing.
