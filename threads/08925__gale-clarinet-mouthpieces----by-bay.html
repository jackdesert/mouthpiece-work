            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve found some Gale mouthpieces in my box of stuff. I have three that are Chedvilles with long beaks, seven that used the same blank, but they are not Chedvilles and two that are Gale Hollywood made with Babbitt plastic blanks. They are are MO-M facing, and each has a identification number. The way these look I am guessing that Charles Bay did these. The markings are the same as those I have found on my Bay mouthpieces.

Do y&#39;all know anything more about these? Are they considered to be good, and what kind of value do they have?

I&#39;ve played thru all of them, and while there are two that I absolutely love, the others don&#39;t float my boat.

Gary
