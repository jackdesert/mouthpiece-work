            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve had two metal Link tenor pieces come in recently that had a thin 
raised ridge along the outer edge of the tip rail.  It looks too even to 
have been damage from dropping, so I&#39;m curious.  Anyone seen this?  I&#39;ll 
try to get a picture if I can.
