We&#39;re introducing a line of mouthpieces in black anodized nickel. Is anyone
aware of a downside to this finish?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Steve et al -  As an interested [clarinetist] reader [Chem  Engr] having 
had courses in Electrochemistry and Plating [long ago], I made a  couple of 
Google searches re: nickel plating hazards and found some refs to  
carcinogenic questions.  I womdered what "Ni compound" the finish might be,  and 
thereby what might be dissolved/ingested by our [healthy] slightly alkaline  pH 
7.4 saliva.  I guess I&#39;m suggesting you might want to take a look into  
what documentation there is "out there",perhaps of no concern at all  ?  Don

            <pre class='message__body'>When my brother was looking for a sax, he asked the seller about black nickel and was told that some people&#39;s chemistry is such that their body oils can leave tarnished fingerprints on black nickel, sort like what happens when I handle newly polished brass.  He may have been told that because the seller didn&#39;t have a black nickel horn in stock.  Don&#39;t know.
