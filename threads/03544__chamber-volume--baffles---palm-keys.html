  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Chamber volume, baffles & palm keys


  I recently refaced a Meyer 5 bari mouthpiece for someone who wanted a 
  very small tip opening (it&#39;s .091 with a 50 length - 25mm).  Plays very 
  well, but palm keys are flat.

  1 - I&#39;m thinking of increasing the chamber volume, which should flatten 
  the mid & lower part of the horn, so it will need to be pushed  further 
  in on the neck cork, pulling the palm keys closer to normal.

  2 - With long baffles (this has a long baffle and a small rollover 
  behind the tip), can the back ("chamber") end of the baffle be removed 
  somewhat (increasing chamber volume) without affecting the tone/response 
  much?  Or do I need to find other places to remove material (boring out 
  the chamber beyond the existing baffle, undercutting side rails)?  Since 
  the back end of that baffle is 25 or 30 mm from the tip, this seems like 
  it might work.

  Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

Sorry I seem to have remembered incorrectly.

This is from Fletcher and Rossing:

"In order that the horn modes be as nearly harmonic as possible, it is desirable that the mouthpiece mimic the acoustic behavior of the missing apex of the cone. This can be done at two frequencies, and then fits reasonably well over the whole range. At low frequencies, the matching is achieved if the internal volume of the mouthpiede is equal to that of the missing conical apex, which requires that the mouthpiece have a slightly bulbous internal shape so that it actually constitutes a sort of Helmholtz resonator. The high-frequency match can then be achieved by arranging the shape of the constriction where it joins the main part of the instrument so that the Helmholtz resonance frequency of the mouthpiece is the same as the first resonance of the missing conical apex, at which it is half a wavelength long.

This mouthpiece cavity has an important effect on the spectrum of the saxophone...The cavity acts rahter like the mouthcup of a brass instrument...and imparts an extra rise of 6 dB per octave below its resonance and a fall of -6 dB/octave above."

I don&#39;t have my copy of Nederveen right here. I&#39;ll have to check it out. I&#39;m pretty sure that I saw it somewhere: that a mismatch only affects notes whose wavelengths are less than 1/4 the length of the truncation, OTOH that can&#39;t be right, because there are no notes that high, only partials.

I&#39;ll try to clarify. In the meantime consider my statement "inoperative" ;-)

Toby
