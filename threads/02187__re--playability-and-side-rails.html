            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Guys, I hope this falls into the general topics of this forum but since
I&#39;ve tried to get suitable answers to this elsewhere without success, I
figured the experts here would have some comments.

I&#39;ve been trying different reeds on different mpc&#39;s and wonder about the
implications - tone, intonation and practical playability issues.  What
started me on this was a tenor reed on a baritone mpc.  I recently got a new
bari mpc and it was too narrow for my bari reeds so I tried a tenor reed
which fit perfectly along the side rails.  Aside from the issues of this
kind of reed switch, I have heard of people who use reeds that are too
narrow for a mpc and actually fit inside the side rails.  I would have
thought that this would create playing issues since we pay a great deal of
attention to the curvature of the side rails relative to the reed vibrations
and sealing.  If this actually works [haven&#39;t tried it myself yet] it would
seem to have implications to the attention paid to the rail curvature.

So, any comments about a reed being smaller [narrower] than the side rails?
How is it that some people claim to play and like the sound of this
combination?

Sorry if this seems inapropriate for this group, but I&#39;m curious.
Ralph

An oboe is a double reed instrument so where the reed meets would be similar to a rail.  I don&#39;t see how a mouthpiece would work properly without having the reed touch the rails to some degree as the player would be losing too much air out of the side of the mouthpiece IMHO if the rails weren&#39;t touching the reed.

            <pre class='message__body'>A piece with the insides of the rails wider then the reed won&#39;t make 
a sound, can&#39;t work. Some pieces, like Sugals, appear to have thick 
rails, but on some only a very small area of the rail is in contact 
with the reed&#39;s edge (the rest stick out on the outside) , almost 
same as a thin rail piece like mine or Guardala. 

Many pieces are narrower than the reed, the impact on vibration loss 
or sound/volume loss is minimal. The normal amount too small is 
fractions of a mm and up to 0.5mm. Some old Links, some FL Links are 
narrow, some wider. They work well. I have just sold a Guardala 
Studio, handmade, alto, that&#39;s also a fraction narrow, but it plays 
great. Some lazer trim models are too narrow. All this does is to 
cause a wide reed (17.5+mm) to sometimes cut into your lip (sharp 
edges) 

Cause in my experience is that they make a model of the mpc and then 
a mould. These are true size. Then they cast it, cool down, metal 
shrink, body sanded, finished, material removed, not as wide as it 
should be, but then --- Guardalas are machined, maybe we should ask 
master powell. With lost wax is worse... Master model->mould -> cast 
wax model -> shrink(already smaller) then invest in ceramic slurry, 
wax burnt out, metal cast -> shrink more. Stainless steel shrink 
even more than brass.BUT...

The width of the rails on the outside can easily be increased by 
just lowering the whole table + lay, as you might have seen when 
opening up a piece. 

If the lay and table is accurate and the baffle a good design, 0.5mm 
width won&#39;t make a big or noticable difference. There&#39;s other things 
that causes bigger changes in sound and playability.

Sometimes the opposite of what we expect happens, like sometimes a 
small window piece plays wonderful, some soprano piece have very 
small windows. 

Sometimes thicker rails give a more desirable tone, depends on the 
chamber design a lot and the body dimentions.

"squeek-proof facing".  Beginners could place the reed on less than 
perfectly, and the mouthpiece/reed will still function well.
