            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Paul,

Just to go on the record.

I bought what I thought would be a terrific soprano mpc made from Grenadilla wood from Sugal.  It was very, very expensive (take a gander at what he sells these mpcs for).

1.   it didn&#39;t come close to fitting on the neck (I have 3 different sizes)
2.   after using much paper to get it on one of the necks, it was so flat that I thought I was playing a whole tone lower.
3.  couldn&#39;t get Mark to fix it after many calls, emails and snail mails (sending it back, again and again).
4.  upon close scrutiny, it was very roughly finished, scratches, grooves, etc.  very poorly finished, and I could go on.....sold it on eBay for $50.


Anyhow Paul, just thought I&#39;d weigh in after seeing some of the other guys experience.

Later bud,

Fred </pre>
