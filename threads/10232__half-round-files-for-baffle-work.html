Sure, grind it off if it&#39;s in the way.  OTOH, you may have an easier time just working farther from the tip.  I find a sharp file tip comes in handy when I widen out a very narrow window and have to redefine the corners.

When you heat and bend files, do you think the metal looses some of its hardness?  Not an issure for HR and plastic but may have a shorter life for metals.

            <pre class='message__body'>Quenching the red hot tip will restore the hardness of high carbon steel and tempering will keep it from being too brittle.  Case hardening will work on mild steel.  If you are concerned about the entire cutting surface of the file, heat the whole thing and quench/temper.  

Bending distorts the teeth in the bend area.  Cutting teeth (with chisel) in a pre-bent/annealed steel rod as desired and then hardening is more effective for those who just have to have custom cutting tools at scrap steel prices - $0.25/lb or less.
