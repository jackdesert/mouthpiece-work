> ﻿Delrin  Mouthpieces
> 
> We&#39;ve been in the saxophone mouthpiece business a VERY long time, and have learned a thing or two along the way. We currently manufacture hand faced mouthpieces made from brass, stainless steel, hard rubber, acrylic, grenadilla wood, and now, the high tech polymer Delrin. We have been experimenting with different materials for several years now, and our experiments have shown conclusively that Delrin is the optimum material for a saxophone mouthpieces because (1) it has superior resonance characteristics to any other material (including hard rubber) and produces a broader spectrum and much quicker response and (2) it is not heat sensitive, so mouthpieces can be manufactured on CNC machines from bar stock to extremely close tolerances.
> 
> If you have any questions about our Delrin Series mouthpieces, just give us a call during our business hours. Remember, Saxgourmet is the ONLYplace where you can actually speak with the designer! (504) 324 - 3850
> 
> 
> Unlike other mouthpiece makers who make their "different" models using the same blank, each model in our Delrin series uses a unique and very different blank.
> 
> 
> Our Delrin Series mouthpieces come with a removable shank weight which by increasing mass increases resonance and projection. When the weight is removed, the tone is entirely different, giving the player two mouthpieces in one!
> 
> 
> ﻿We learned through our experiments that by threading the tone chamber we were able to make the low notes speak easier and without harshness.
> 
> 
> The shape and thickness of the beak is crucial in determining the tone and projection of a mouthpiece. As you can see, these are VERY different!
> 
> 
> The most important factors in determining how a mouthpiece plays are the shape of the baffle and she size of the tone chamber. As you see, both of these are very different, and both have elliptical chambers for easier altissimo.
> 
> 
> Like all of our mouthpieces, the Dragons Tongue and Super Duck are both individually hand faced by Steve Goodson at our office in New Orleans. No mouthpiece is shipped to the customer until it is play tested by him.
> 
> 
> The blanks for our Dragons Tongue and Super Duck mouthpieces are made to our specifications in Phoenix Arizona by EMR Machine using state of the art five axis CNC machines. The master machinists there convert our original designs into mouthpiece blanks.

> 
> ﻿All Saxgourmet mouthpieces are designed by Steve Goodson and are only available on our website.

> The shank weight makes a most excellent pinky ring!
