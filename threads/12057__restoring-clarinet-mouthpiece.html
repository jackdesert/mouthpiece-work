You really would be refacing it, probably crooked, since it takes a lot of
practice to an even &#39;slide&#39;. Tiny dents may not be a problem if the reed is
sealing. But if the dents are pushed up toward the reed, I would suggest
turning some sandpaper upside down to polish the facing. Start with the
mouthpiece flat to flatten the table and gently roll the mouthpiece up
toward the tip without &#39;rolling&#39; the flat surface of the tip over. The
inside scratches are also not a problem.

Good luck.

Hi everyone,

 

 

I&#39;m currently looking into restoring my old Vandoren 5RV lyre clarinet
mouthpiece that I used to play on when I was a beginner/intermediate student
on the clarinet 5 years ago. It wasn&#39;t looked after very well back then, and
as a result there are tiny dents on the tip rail and what appears to be many
light scratches on the inside of the mouthpiece starting from the throat
going all the way up to the tip rail. I&#39;m completely new to this, so I have
no idea where to start. Should I use a file or sanding stick to try and
remove the scratches inside the throat and baffle? And to reface the tip
rail to remove the dents, I just slide the end of the mouthpiece 2 or 3
times over a wet 300 grit sandpaper on a sheet of glass, right? 

 

Any kind of advice/suggestions will be greatly appreciated,

 

Harim.

Minor scratches inside the throat and baffle are a cosmetic issue only. 
Don&#39;t bother unless you&#39;re keen on creating a work of mouthpiece art, 
glossy everywhere.

Taking off tip rail dents will open up the facing and change your facing 
curve.  Results will depend on how deep the dents are, and how well you 
maintain a favorably-shaped facing curve in your alterations; but you 
can certainly expect a change in how the mouthpiece plays.

Removal of deeper tip rail dents will open the facing more; and the tip 
rail will get wider.  A more open facing plays louder but harder to 
control, needs more air.  Wider tip rail reduces harmonics, sound is 
less bright.  Depending on how much material is removed, you may want to 
take down the table and adjust the tip rail width, if your aim is 
restoring the mouthpiece to close to original specs.

I suggest you take facing curve and tip measurements before getting 
started, so you have a restoration point of sorts.   Also, go slow and 
test-play frequently to see what has changed, and whether what you have 
is good enough.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dents in a hard rubber mouthpiece can be removed without files or sandpaper.
You use a match or lighter to do it. Hold the mouthpiece in your left hand
with the facing upwards, so that the dents are facing the ceiling. Light the
match or lighter, and quickly pass the flame closely OVER the dents. The
edge of the flame should just barely touch the mouthpiece material, and only
momentarily as you pass the flame over the dented surface. Do not hold the
flame in place or you will melt the mouthpiece and ruin it. If you sweep the
flame over in rapid succession, the dents will pop out. Do not hold the
flame UNDER the mouthpiece, or there will be too much heat, also resulting
in a ruined mouthpiece. The dents will pop out but you may see an outline
where they once were. At this point, stop. Don&#39;t continue passing the flame
over to try and make it showroom new. Don&#39;t attempt to sand anything at this
point either. You&#39;ll likely just ruin the mouthpiece. 

 

Commentary from a clarinetist: In my experience, a 5RVLyre is difficult to
control due to its facing. You might try an M13Lyre or a B45. Those facings
are much friendlier to play, especially for someone with only a few years of
experience. I&#39;ve had many students come in with a 5RVLyre, and once they
switch mouthpieces they have much faster progress.

The Ridenour and Stein sources you mention, are they books ?I&#39;m pretty happy with progress gained from the other sources, but am curious about refining the corners of the tip.Do either of your suggestions deal with that ?
Oh, and is this even the appropriate forum ?Thanks again.Ross

            <pre class='message__body'>I'm not sure about the  Keith Stein. Ridenour sells a kit with book and video. it's fairly pricey but over the years it has saved me a lot of money from  saving reeds I would have previously discarded.  You can check him out on youtube
  He mostly discusses balancing both sides of the reed at the tip. He doesn't zone in on detailed parts of the reed like Teal or Opperman do but , as I said I have had much more success from his method.
   There is also an interesting youtube video about how reeds swell and distort  at the interface with the window of the mouthpiece, causing them  not to play well.
  The best mouthpiece won't play without a decent reed so why not discuss it here?

if you have not seen the Youtube  video on finishing reeds by the Associate 
Principal Clarinetist of the New  York Sym., you might want to take a look. 
 It is a seven day  procession for breaking in reeds and it works.  i 
strongly recommend  the new Vandoren V21 clarinet reeds, too.

I went through all that reed  stuff, the Larry Teal, the Keith Stein, the

but I have  never been able to duplicate his results. He was a wizard!  
Look up what Tom Ridenour  says about reeds. His Reed  Finishing Kit has 
made all the difference for me, especially since I  have to deal with all four 
saxes plus clarinet.
I also like the  Reed Geek  video, though you can make  the required tool 
for a few bucks, not  the $50 that they charge.
 My philosophy on reeds has become KISS and I  am much  happier for it.

Reeds really are a bete noir, unless one has by some chance found a 
perfect match of reed and mouthpiece.

I actually set up a single reed group on Yahoo in a brief fit of 
ambition, but then never did the work to get it started, and they shut 
it down due to inactivity. But there&#39;s a lot to discuss. Care to start a 
single reed group?

The Ridenour method works pretty well, that is, his method of balancing 
the L & R side of reeds, and adjusting using a cushioned sanding block w 
fine paper, and sanding from tip to front, and at an angle across the 
harder reed corner towards the opposite corner, more or less. Happy to 
go into more detail. Tom&#39;s kit is pricey (but pays for itself both in 
money spent on reeds, as well as in player satisfaction... "priceless") 
One can easily make sanding blocks of the sort he uses. His method 
should be a basic article of instruction for single-reed players... 
Maybe it is already.

            <pre class='message__body'>The only think Ridenour does not deal with is the flat side of the reed, which is where the Reed Geek  comes in.  At this stage I am more likely to give up on a reed if the flat side is greatly warped than if it needs adjustment on the  vamp side.. Soaking the reed and then trying to get the  warp out is always worth a try but the reed often returns to it's warped shape once it dries again.
  The other issue not covered is the window  bump that forms on the flat part from swelling while on the mouthpiece. Years ago i attended a talk by the late Reginald Kell, famous player and the guy who taught Benny Goodman  double lip. He said that once on his mouthpiece he never took  a reed off until  he decided it was dead and then he just got a new one out.  Peter

But when trying to increase the rattle in an already decent reed, I&#39;m wondering what effect the corner tip radius might have, as well as the overall width of the blade.I thought removing material from the most active area should make it quicker to respond, but I&#39;ve spoiled as many as I&#39;ve helped.

            <pre class='message__body'>There seems to be only a couple of areas on the top of the  reed that can be safely scraped without destroying it and I think Ridenour  has that down pretty well.. he mostly emphasizes how the reed  balances the sound from one side to the other.  The trouble with working on the tip corners is that they are already so thin that they often get broken off with the least scraping. Sometimes it looks like I have gotten it right and then just in playing the reed I notice a tip will break  off. They usually work just as well, unless they don't quite cover the rails on the mouthpiece, but I always worry about such reeds, thinking they might cause problems.  Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>With Tom's kit, you are not just paying for the simple tools and video.  You are 
paying, in part, for the knowledge he imparts to you, and the method he teaches 
you on the video.

An aside, I know Tom, have talked to him face to face, via email, many times.

What Tom does is test for the four things a reed must do.  A reed must:

(1) Play high notes,

(2) Play low notes, 

If it can do that, it can do the notes in between.

(3) Play loudly, and finally, 

(4) Play softly.

If it can do that, it can do the volume levels in between.

That's all the reed must do.  He teaches you specific playing tests to test for 
those things, and teaches you how to correct them.

Yes, side to side balance is part of that.  He teaches you how to play and 
test for that, and how to correct.

The sanding method he teaches is so simple he does not even have to look 
at the reed in order to do it.  I have seen him correct a reed while looking 
me in the eye telling me how to do it.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve worked with Tom&#39;s method for some years now, and found it very 
valuable, but also lacking in certain areas, for example adjusting a 
reed to get a desired tonal response (the Larry Teal chart is  useful 
here). If that information is in Tom&#39;s video or book, maybe I missed it.

What has proved very useful to me is a Perfectareed gauge - It&#39;s a much 
faster method of locating and dealing with more reed asymmetries, 
especially on synthetic reeds, which are more resistant to sanding. I 
used Tom&#39;s method on Fibracells for some years - it worked, but it was 
slow going.

            <pre class='message__body'>Taking a little off the bottom front 1/3 or 1/4 of the shaped part of 
the reed by stroking it on sandpaper (stroking away from the tip) 
usually gives a reed a bit more "rattle" in my experience, brightens it. 
That&#39;s assuming that the reed is otherwise symmetrical, balanced.  
Especially true when a reed has been clipped.

Balancing the resistance of the reed corners a la Ridenour may be all 
that&#39;s necessary, though. Using fine sandpaper as he does, the amounts 
taken off are rather small. Basically, one rotates the mouthpiece on the 
instrument a bit to either side in one&#39;s mouth so that one edge of the 
reed is dampened, and pops out a note. He suggests doing this with a 
double-lip embouchure. One can feel if there&#39;s a difference in response 
between the 2 reed corners. Take down the harder corner a wee bit, test 
play, check the balance if not satisfied, repeat.

Another way for more reed buzz is to add a baffle insert.

Some synthetic reeds are more buzzy than cane. I find they are also more 
efficient sound producers than cane, especially the Hartman and (if you 
can get them) Hahn reeds.  And far more durable.

I&#39;m speaking of tenor and alto reeds here for jazz/pop/blues style 
playing, not "legit."

On the basis that they have very accurate machines producing hopefully consistent profiles, their Java (red & green), V12, V16, ZZ along with their "Traditional" reeds in every half strength gives a range of profiles which I've only just lightly sampled!  

 I like Trad 2.5, Java red 2.5 - 3 and V16 2.5 depending on the mouthpiece. They seem remarkably consistent across the ranges but I do have a couple of very dark cane trad 2.5s which I've labelled "Hard" 'cos they play like 3s at least. The dark cane really stands out visually and I assume is the reason for this.

Those have been pretty much the methods I&#39;ve been using to improve rattle / response.I put most effort into my rock and roll piece which is a jumbo java that already has a huge baffle and a .105 tip.

I will try your double lip suggestion for testing, I&#39;ve tried using it to play, but couldn&#39;t get used to it.
Ray Reed suggests thinning a small area at the centre tip, but doesn&#39;t say what change it should produce.What would you expect the difference to be ?I&#39;ve tried it on many reeds but didn&#39;t notice an obvious change.
As for reeds themselves, the vandoren java&#39;s are far more expensive, but have far smaller machining marks.Many of the others were pretty crudely made by comparison.Ross

In general, thinner sides of a reed make a darker sound and thinner center
make a brighter sound. 

That is why the old Rico (flat cut) reeds were brighter than the Vandorens
(round cut with stronger center).

Today, most reed brands have many different cuts but the results are the
same.

Thanks Barry and others

 

Those have been pretty much the methods I&#39;ve been using to improve rattle /
response.

I put most effort into my rock and roll piece which is a jumbo java that
already has a huge baffle and a .105 tip.

 

I will try your double lip suggestion for testing, I&#39;ve tried using it to
play, but couldn&#39;t get used to it.

 

Ray Reed suggests thinning a small area at the centre tip, but doesn&#39;t say
what change it should produce.

What would you expect the difference to be ?

I&#39;ve tried it on many reeds but didn&#39;t notice an obvious change.

 

As for reeds themselves, the vandoren java&#39;s are far more expensive, but
have far smaller machining marks.

Many of the others were pretty crudely made by comparison.

Taking a little off the bottom front 1/3 or 1/4 of the shaped part of 
the reed by stroking it on sandpaper (stroking away from the tip) 
usually gives a reed a bit more "rattle" in my experience, brightens it. 
That&#39;s assuming that the reed is otherwise symmetrical, balanced.  
Especially true when a reed has been clipped.

Balancing the resistance of the reed corners a la Ridenour may be all 
that&#39;s necessary, though. Using fine sandpaper as he does, the amounts 
taken off are rather small. Basically, one rotates the mouthpiece on the 
instrument a bit to either side in one&#39;s mouth so that one edge of the 
reed is dampened, and pops out a note. He suggests doing this with a 
double-lip embouchure. One can feel if there&#39;s a difference in response 
between the 2 reed corners. Take down the harder corner a wee bit, test 
play, check the balance if not satisfied, repeat.

Another way for more reed buzz is to add a baffle insert.

Some synthetic reeds are more buzzy than cane. I find they are also more 
efficient sound producers than cane, especially the Hartman and (if you 
can get them) Hahn reeds.  And far more durable.

I&#39;m speaking of tenor and alto reeds here for jazz/pop/blues style 
playing, not "legit."

            <pre class='message__body'>I am not sure mechanically what is going on but a guess is that the weak
center is hitting the tip first and the sides slap against the edges of the

Thank you so much Ken, brighter is where I&#39;d like to be, and I&#39;ve been
adjusting for the opposite.

>> Ray Reed suggests thinning a small area at the centre tip,

In general, thinner sides of a reed make a darker sound and thinner center
make a brighter sound. 

That is why the old Rico (flat cut) reeds were brighter than the Vandorens
(round cut with stronger center).

Today, most reed brands have many different cuts but the results are the
same.

Thanks Barry and others

 

Those have been pretty much the methods I&#39;ve been using to improve rattle /
response.

I put most effort into my rock and roll piece which is a jumbo java that
already has a huge baffle and a .105 tip.

 

I will try your double lip suggestion for testing, I&#39;ve tried using it to
play, but couldn&#39;t get used to it.

 

Ray Reed suggests thinning a small area at the centre tip, but doesn&#39;t say
what change it should produce.

What would you expect the difference to be ?

I&#39;ve tried it on many reeds but didn&#39;t notice an obvious change.

 

As for reeds themselves, the vandoren java&#39;s are far more expensive, but
have far smaller machining marks.

Many of the others were pretty crudely made by comparison.

Taking a little off the bottom front 1/3 or 1/4 of the shaped part of 
the reed by stroking it on sandpaper (stroking away from the tip) 
usually gives a reed a bit more "rattle" in my experience, brightens it. 
That&#39;s assuming that the reed is otherwise symmetrical, balanced.  
Especially true when a reed has been clipped.

Balancing the resistance of the reed corners a la Ridenour may be all 
that&#39;s necessary, though. Using fine sandpaper as he does, the amounts 
taken off are rather small. Basically, one rotates the mouthpiece on the 
instrument a bit to either side in one&#39;s mouth so that one edge of the 
reed is dampened, and pops out a note. He suggests doing this with a 
double-lip embouchure. One can feel if there&#39;s a difference in response 
between the 2 reed corners. Take down the harder corner a wee bit, test 
play, check the balance if not satisfied, repeat.

Another way for more reed buzz is to add a baffle insert.

Some synthetic reeds are more buzzy than cane. I find they are also more 
efficient sound producers than cane, especially the Hartman and (if you 
can get them) Hahn reeds.  And far more durable.

I&#39;m speaking of tenor and alto reeds here for jazz/pop/blues style 
playing, not "legit."

Also is there an opinion on how tight the reed should be held ?I can get a seal with the lig. very loose, but have a problem with loose reeds moving when you have to adjust tuning.For that reason I&#39;ve gone back to firmer lig. tensions.Any thoughts ?

Actually this is not off topic as I find it is a combination of the mouthpiece, reed, and ligature that makes the sound producing trilogy. The reed becomes half of the tone generating system. I have used Tom’s method for many years plus the use of a good knife. To shape the reed to the facing is imperative in my opinion.
