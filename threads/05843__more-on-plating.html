            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been researching a little more about plating, and whether it&#39;s 
worth the time/effort/mess/expense of getting set up to do it myself.  
Here&#39;s what I think I know:

- In order to electroplate an entire mouthpiece, it has to be buffed 
down to raw brass - all of the existing plating has to be removed, 
including the inside of the mouthpiece.  This requires a buffing wheel 
and jeweler&#39;s rouge, and makes a big ol&#39; mess.
- The mouthpiece needs to be super-clean before plating, requiring some 
specialized process, and probably some solvents.
- You can&#39;t plate gold onto brass without an intermediate layer of 
nickel or silver.  If you want gold, you have to plate twice.
- Having a mouthpiece plated would cost about $25-$35
- The Caswell nickel plating kits are around $200
- Caswell "Plug N&#39; Plate" brush-on kits start at about $35-$40 and can 
be used to touch up just the areas of the mouthpiece on which plating 
has been removed
- Otto Frei has felt-tip electroplating "pens" ($150) which seem to be a 
more refined version of the Caswell Plug &#39;N Plate.

My shop is just a workbench in my office, so the polishing wheel and 
jeweler&#39;s rouge thing is not appealing, nor is the prospect of using 
lots of solvents.  If I can just use the Plug &#39;N Plate to silver (or 
nickel) plate the areas of the mouthpiece that need it, that might 
work.  Of course I can just continue to reface the mouthpieces and leave 
it at that!

Any opinions/info/advice?  Thanks in advance for your help.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve used the little Casswell Plug n Plate for silver and, recently, for 
gold.  Silver goes on great if you&#39;ve got the right material.  Easy to build 
up a thick plating.  For an entire mouthpiece, it might be easier to use a 
bigger kit.  I haven&#39;t figured out the gold yet.  I tried 1.7 volts (used 
for silver), 3V, and 6V.  The gold plated very slowly and tended to leave a 
gold wash of varying thicknesses.  Also, it came right off with any 
polishing cloth.  Something&#39;s not right.  I clean with hydrogen peroxide 
followed by rubbing alcohol.

Instead of using the little stainless stylus that comes with the kit and 
wrapping a tiny piece of cloth around it to hold the solution, I switched to 
a small paint brush with a metal ferrel.  Dip it deep enough for the 
solution to saturate up to the ferrel and hook one allegator clip to it.  
Works much better.

After you plate a little area, the metal comes out of the solution.  Wipe 
the expended solution off.  Otherwise, when you recharge with new solution, 
it gets dilluted with the old.  I also touch the brush to a towel before 
redipping it to pull out the old solution.  Probably not 100% effective, but 
makes the process go faster.

I recently bought one of the "gold-plated" metal Chinese mps that was talked 
about on this site.  I&#39;m not sure that "gold" means gold.  In fact, coming 
from China and given the recent news on food and drug contamination, I 
wonder if cadmium, lead, plutonium, etc. could be an alloy component of the 
"gold."  My idea was to silver plate the gold mp to match an old horn.  
Haven&#39;t gotten to that project yet.

I got better results with turning the brush plating kit into a small dip
