I hope that someone out there can help me identify the make of an Alto mouthpiece I recently acquired. It is semi-translucent dark red plastic(only appears red when held up to a light source), and has POWERTONE in gold lettering near the lower middle chamber area. I have attempted to research this piece on the Internet with no success. Anyone?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Paul, Thanks for your help. I couldn&#39;t find your E-mail address, 
so I uploaded the pictures to a folder named Mystery Mouthpiece in 
the PHOTOS section. The only writing that is still present on the 
piece is located toward the bottom of the barrel, and 
says "POWERTONE". I appologize for the rather poor pictures,however, 
I think that you can make out the lettering type from them. I should 
add that the tooth protector patch is, of course, an after market add-
on. This mouthpiece has a rather large bore, and virtually no baffle. 
It&#39;s design reminds me of many 20&#39;s through 40&#39;s mouthpieces I have, 
although I don&#39;t think that it is of that vintage. I aquired it with 
a Vintage King Zephyr that I bought from the estate of a Pro Sax 
player. The horn and mouthpiece both play super, by the way.Thanks 
again. Mike.

            <pre class='message__body'>Mike:   I wonder if it is an old King mouthpiece?  Runyon made 
mouthpieces for King.  Actually, your mouthpiece looks like an old 
Brilhart, as far as the shape of the shank.

 

I would have to look at the chamber to see if it is either a Brilhart or 
a Runyon 22 chamber.  As far as red mouthpieces, there was the Runyon 
Custom, but a more normal red, and a deep, dark red Holton, with metal 
inside the chamber and facing/table area.  But this was hard rubber, not 
plastic, and certainly, not transparent in the least.

 

So, I am not sure what you have.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the info Paul. I think you may have hit on it when you 
said it might be a Runyon made KING mouthpiece. Everything about the 
horn was "Stock" including the accessories, case, lyre etc. I think 
this piece probably came with the horn when purchased new. There was 
an aftermarket Brilhart included in the deal as well, which seems to 
have been used a great deal more by the original owner. Again, Thanks 
for the research info. Mike.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, that is the same mouthpiece (referring to the Red Conn on Theo 
Wann&#39;s site).  Those were made by Runyon for Conn. 

The basic material of the Runyon mouthpieces is glass clear.  The amount 
of tint, of course, determines the shade of red.

Runyon also made mouthpieces for King, and a number of other mfgs.  In 
the period following WWII, European mouthpieces were not being produced, 
and Runyon and Brilhart were the main manufacturers of plastic 
mouthpieces in the US.

            <pre class='message__body'>A little tricky to follow at first but they are trumpet, Trombone and
Tuba mpcs. Interestingly enough they play quite well but do indeed sound
and feel quite different to play, easier on the chops than the brass
mpcs but they seem to lack the punch and power of the metal mpcs.
