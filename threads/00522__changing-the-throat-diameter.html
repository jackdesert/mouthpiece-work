            <pre class='message__body'>Like I stated on the Rico Metallite I shoved a 1/2 inch piece of soft 
flexible clear gasoline type tubing into the mouthpiece bore.  It was 
placed as close to the window, without covering any of the window.  
Being 1/2 inch long, it did indeed effect the chamber size, but as 
Paul stated the chambers on these pieces need to be reduced in size.

If one is dealing with another model/brand mouthpiece, try gluing a 
rubber an "O" Ring into the Bore, with SHOE GOO.  This will in effect 
reduce the throat diameter, with very little chamber reduction.
