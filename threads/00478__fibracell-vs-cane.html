            <pre class='message__body'>I put a sound file in the Files - Tenor area.  

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MouthpieceWork/files/Tenor%20Sax/

I have no doubt that with "training" some can pick them out.  The 
sound file has 6 samples in random order.  3 have V16 cane reeds, 3 
have Fibracells.  See the text file for details.  

Email me your guesses and I&#39;ll send you the answers.

I also created a Database if you want to log your answers and see 
what others think.
