basic beginning students models, as are sold as OEM with many new

The 22 alto, BTW, was played by Charlie Parker.  It was a pro piece back
then.

These make good work pieces, experimenting on baffle shape, facing etc.
These same models are included, for this purpose, with the Madison
Enterprises (John Winslow) mouthpiece kit.

I talked to Lilly at the Runyon factory, and she says there will be a
production run of alto 22&#39;s next week, and tenor 22&#39;s the week after.

So, I will tentatively be ordering 24 each.  These will be black,
unmarked, no ligature, no cap, but with a #4 facing put on.  That is
.066" tip alto, .078" tip tenor.  So, there is a lot of meat to work on.

I estimate (do not hold me to it) that I will be able to get these for
about $5-$6 each, and there will be about $3 postage per pkg.

Please get your pre-orders in to me now.  As soon as I have a firm
price, will let you know.

I will be ordering alto AND tenor blanks, Runyon model 22&#39;s.  These are
basic beginning students models, as are sold as OEM with many new
student saxes.

The 22 alto, BTW, was played by Charlie Parker.  It was a pro piece back
then.

These make good work pieces, experimenting on baffle shape, facing etc.
These same models are included, for this purpose, with the Madison
