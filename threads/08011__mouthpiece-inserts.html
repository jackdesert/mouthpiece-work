bookmarked......does anybody here have any experience with the chamber
inserts of this type?

 

We&#39;ve considered offering some baffles for sale that players could install
in their own mouthpieces, and have made some prototypes. They&#39;re really
pretty basic, but work pretty well. I recall that in the mid-90&#39;s somebody
was selling some adhesive egg shaped inserts that were all the rage among
tenor players here in New Orleans, although I haven&#39;t seen any for years.

 

I know the Runyon Spoiler works pretty well, and I don&#39;t fully understand
the function of the secondary reed in spite of Santy&#39;s explanations to me
during my lessons. Like a lot of his designs, I always thought the Spoiler
had a serious amount of Voodoo about it, but there is NO question that it
worked, which is the only important thing. Santy gave me a box full of
assorted sized Spoilers and I&#39;ve tried them with various degrees of success
in other mouthpieces. I think there is more work that can be done in this
insert area, and I am interested in pursuing it.

The Spoiler metal reed does little to nothing IMO.  I have clipped them off and made epoxy baffle inserts with and without metal reeds attached.  All that matters is the size and location of the baffle part.

            <pre class='message__body'>I wonder just how much the spoiler actually vibrates. I&#39;d think that it
would have a fixed frequency - it&#39;s a metal strip clamped at one end.

Not having one of these mouthpieces (although just ordered one recently,
awaiting), I&#39;ve added flexible spoilers to various wedges I&#39;ve made, based
on pictures of the Runyon spoilers, and can&#39;t say I noticed much of a
difference with or without.

Maybe his are twangier than the ones I made.

This looks like the patent:

            <pre class='message__body'>It has always been my understanding that when an "aftermarket" baffle is put into an existing well dimensioned mouthpiece, that the volume taken away must be replaced by removing an equivalent amount of material in the chamber of the mouthpiece.  Otherwise intonation problems are created.  

I have had several discussions with mouthpiece maker Ernie Northway on this topic and although he keeps most of his knowledge close to his vest, he does describe how when he takes away he adds somewhere else, and vice versa.

I wonder just how much the spoiler actually vibrates. I&#39;d think that it
would have a fixed frequency - it&#39;s a metal strip clamped at one end.

Not having one of these mouthpieces (although just ordered one recently,
awaiting), I&#39;ve added flexible spoilers to various wedges I&#39;ve made, based
on pictures of the Runyon spoilers, and can&#39;t say I noticed much of a
difference with or without.

Maybe his are twangier than the ones I made.

This looks like the patent:

The stick-on baffles are still sold as Hot Sax baffles or Powertone baffles.
You can find them via Google.

The Spoiler metal reed does little to nothing IMO. I have clipped them off
and made epoxy baffle inserts with and without metal reeds attached. All
that matters is the size and location of the baffle part.

It has always been my understanding that when an "aftermarket" baffle is put into an existing well dimensioned mouthpiece, that the volume taken away must be replaced by removing an equivalent amount of material in the chamber of the mouthpiece. Otherwise intonation problems are created. 

I have had several discussions with mouthpiece maker Ernie Northway on this topic and although he keeps most of his knowledge close to his vest, he does describe how when he takes away he adds somewhere else, and vice versa.

I do a bunch of added baffles for my clients.  Some are removable and some are semi-permanent.  Most use a pea-sized amount of epoxy putty.  If they are looking for a lot more than that, I start taking some material out of the chamber.  That is, unless they say the have sharp palm keys.  In that case the added material will help the player.  But I rarely add that much material.  Most clients are looking for a small change.

This type of work is best done during a visit.  We can try several shapes, sizes, and locations using temporary putty.  Then when we find something they like, I can make it out of quick-set epoxy putty.  Since visits are not practical for most of my clients, I encourage them to experiment with temporary putty on their own if they are looking for added projection and brightness.  Then they can send me a shape they like.  But most just want me to take a shot at it based on their verbal description of what changes they are looking for.  If it is not right, they just need to send it back for an adjustment.

            <pre class='message__body'>I suggest you experiment.  If you look at pix of the Runyon "spoilers", you
can get a sense of what&#39;s common - and bear in mind that the Runyons play
with and without baffle inserts.

I started making them some years ago after seeing some pictures online, and
I have not noticed intonation problems, except possibly with some soprano
pieces (and soprano is hard enough to play sweetly, as it is.) I posted some
pictures a while back of a few.

Often they can wedge firmly in place and stay put quite well, if they are
shaped accurately enough.

One interesting thing I noticed was that on all mouthpieces I&#39;ve done this
for, the passage towards the throat gradually narrows.  Interestingly, on a
Florida Link, the passage way widens a bit instead, and the wedge has to be
inserted and removed from the back of the mouthpiece.

From the point of view of volume displacement, the kind of inserts that Joe
Smallwood was selling would take up less space in the mouthpiece.  I have
yet to experiment along his lines, though.

            <pre class='message__body'>I’ve probably put in a couple of hundred additional baffles over the years, both epoxy and sometimes metal. A little additional baffle typically goes a long way. You’ve got to sit down with the player and tweak the baffle to their wishes, which ends up taking a fair amount of time with my meter running. Whenever we do this tweaking,  we ALWAYS have the tuner in the room, so there is never any discussion of “you ruined my intonation”…..I generally try to talk customers out of having a baffle installed….they are generally better served by keeping what they’ve got and buying an additional mouthpiece…….it’s almost always more cost efficient for them to do so.

I do a bunch of added baffles for my clients.  Some are removable and some are semi-permanent.  Most use a pea-sized amount of epoxy putty.  If they are looking for a lot more than that, I start taking some material out of the chamber.  That is, unless they say the have sharp palm keys.  In that case the added material will help the player.  But I rarely add that much material.  Most clients are looking for a small change.

 

This type of work is best done during a visit.  We can try several shapes, sizes, and locations using temporary putty.  Then when we find something they like, I can make it out of quick-set epoxy putty.  Since visits are not practical for most of my clients, I encourage them to experiment with temporary putty on their own if they are looking for added projection and brightness.  Then they can send me a shape they like.  But most just want me to take a shot at it based on their verbal description of what changes they are looking for.  If it is not right, they just need to send it back for an adjustment.

Thanks Keith. That makes sense. It still seems to me that a novice
putting a baffle into a mouthpiece that wasn&#39;t designed for one in the
first place would be a real crap shoot. Have you modified any customers
mouthpieces by adding a baffle at their request? How difficult is that
to do without making other adjustments to insures the piece plays
properly?

            <pre class='message__body'>Ernie Northway has been making custom mouthpieces for over 30 years.  I believe it would be best to withhold criticism of his remarks until one actually sees one of his mouthpieces and the type of baffle he adds.

Saying that all mouthpieces need to have the correct balance in their internal dimensions to play well does not imply that there is only one mouthpiece that would work on each horn.

(trimmed)

Steve, first, and this is not opinion, I have sound analysis graphs here of spoiler vs. no spoiler, all else the same, and they clearly show that the spoiler insert increases the strength of the overtones in the 1.5-2.5 khz range, where the ear is very sensitive.

Now my personal view of the device is that it acts like an extended high baffle, but the thin metal reed takes up very little chamber volume, with only the black plastic baffle piece taking up volume.  So, it acts like a much larger, longer baffle, yet does not take up enough volume to have a serious affect on intonation.  And difference from the small amount of volume taken up is easily compensated for by adjusting the mouthpiece on the cork.

(trimmed)

The Runyon spoiler baffles are made specifically for the model they are placed in.  They are individually hand fitted to each mouthpiece by filing on the "nubs" you will find on the side of the black plastic wedge so that they wedge in tight at a specific distance from the tip of the mouthpiece.  And this varies from model to model.

This is why you can&#39;t just "order a spoiler" to try in your Selmer Soloist or Berg or other mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I have worked on a Northway tenor mouthpiece, and seen some others. The baffle
inserts I have seen in them (that is, added material like epoxy or something)
are very big - larger than what an "average" baffle adjustment to a client's
mouthpiece would entail. They come up very close to the rails, and extend
pretty far back. It appears that he's making these from some type of blank,
but adding a lot of baffle material - this could very well require some volume
adjustment elsewhere in the chamber. In contrast, when I've added baffles to
clients' mouthpieces, the client usually wants basically the same mouthpiece,
but with some added "punch", so I'm adding maybe about a third of that amount
of material. In short, you might both be right.

big wedge baffle inserted. There was not much side wall visible between the
rails and the surface of the baffle (that is, it's a very high baffle). Fairly
straight baffle surface (to the naked eye), and I don't remember if the back
end dropped straight off (perpendicular) or had a little angle to it, but I'm
pretty sure it didn't "taper" into the chamber. If I remember correctly, it
extended about 3/4" back from the tip.  
  
I've only looked closely at that one tenor mouthpiece, but the other ones I've
played had that projection, volume, and immediacy of response you'd expect
from a long, straight, high baffle like this.

I have worked on a Northway tenor mouthpiece, and seen some others. The
baffle inserts I have seen in them (that is, added material like epoxy or
something) are very big - larger than what an "average" baffle adjustment to
a client&#39;s mouthpiece would entail.  They come up very close to the rails,
and extend pretty far back.  It appears that he&#39;s making these from some
type of blank, but adding a lot of baffle material - this could very well

            <pre class='message__body'>The Runyon Spoilers are very much "Runyon specific" in size. Santy gave me a
big box full years ago, and there must have been literally 20 different
sizes. In my experiments, I adapted some to other brands, but some trimming
was usually necessary for a good fit.

 

Santy also gave me a generous supply of the Spoiler baffles without the
metal reeds attached. In comparing the effects of reed vs. no reed, I know
that the reed makes a significant difference.

(trimmed)

The Runyon spoiler baffles are made specifically for the model they are
placed in. They are individually hand fitted to each mouthpiece by filing on
the "nubs" you will find on the side of the black plastic wedge so that they
wedge in tight at a specific distance from the tip of the mouthpiece. And
this varies from model to model.

This is why you can&#39;t just "order a spoiler" to try in your Selmer Soloist
or Berg or other mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just made a insert baffle for a Beechler Diamond s6s alto mouthpiece. First I did remove a little material from the chamber, but not the same amount as the size of the baffle. I also put a longer facing on it, and thinned the rails. I don´t find the intonation to be very different from before. What suprised me most was the big difference before and after I made the small "bullet".

I have uploaded three pictures of it in the Photo section, under "Baffle Inserts".
