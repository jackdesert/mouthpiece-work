            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Gregory 5 16 M.   At the throat it dips down at the roof area.  The sides come in slightly but overall it is quite round going right through.    Can a take a basic blank and achieve something like this?   What tools would you recommend?   How do you know when to stop?   Do you test for pitch?  It seems this would be more significant for a clarinet mouthpiece.
