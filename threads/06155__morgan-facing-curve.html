            <pre class='message__body'>Does anybody have a chart of the curve of the Morgan mouthpieces for
tenor. How does it differ to radial curve and is that the secret to
his pieces playing superbly. 
Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>Most Morgans I have seen have a facing curve close to an elliptical section
with a major/minor axis ratio of 4.

If you have a favorite Morgan, just measure the curve yourself and try and
duplicate it.
