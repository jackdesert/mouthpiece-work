Hey Gang-

I just got a new back up for my main alto mouthpiece (Selmer Soloist C)
and noticed a large difference in the chamber size.  My curiosity
piqued, I got out all of the different soloists in my stock to compare
chamber sizes.

I have posted a photo album here at the mouthpiece work site (
http://launch.ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/MouthpieceWork/photos/browse/502&#92;
5?m=l
&lt;http://launch.ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/MouthpieceWork/photos/browse/50&#92;
25?m=l>  ) with close-up shots of the 6 mouthpieces in question.

It seems that the long shank models have a slightly smaller chamber (to
maintain the chamber volume of the longer mouthpiece I assume).

The last two photos show the two Short Shank Alto examples with the
different chambers.  The first one (alto short shank # 1) is my main
piece with what I consider a normal soloist chamber.  The second pic
(alto short shank # 2) is the new back up.  The chamber is much larger
in width and it lacks the "Step down" as the chamber enters the bore.  I
assumed this must have been chamber work done by someone later, but
after examining the Tenor short shank, it also had much less of a step.

Does any of you have any info on variance in chamber size for these
great mouthpieces?  Also, can you tell from these pics whether that alto
chamber is original or was opened up by someone later?

In case you&#39;re wondering, the two alto mouthpieces have the following
relative playing charateristics:

1) smaller chamber - more resistant but with a more complex sound -
reeds play a little harder and altissimo is easier (these last two may
be due to the facing curve)

2) larger chamber - more free blowing (especially down low) with a less
complex, smoother sound.  It is also responds a little less up in the
altissimo register - also may only be due to facing curve differences.

Thanks in advance!
