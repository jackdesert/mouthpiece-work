            <pre class='message__body'>My lovely wife, in an attempt to sterilize her old mpc, decided that a 
little boiling water was just the thing. The mouthpiece came out very 
mottled in color with many different shades. Is there a way to restore 
it to it&#39;s original color?? It still performs well so it didn&#39;t damage 
it, just discolored it.

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Your wife has also probably warped the facing.  Hard rubber mouthpieces and heat do not work and play well together.
   
  After you have the facing checked, and probably reworked, try rubbing the mouthpiece with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.  After you scrub off some of the brown and green oxidation, then polish by hand with a soft cloth and a good plastic polish.  I use Scratchout by Kit, sold in automotive parts stores.  Flitz Metal Polish works well, too.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, a lot of substances will do this to hard rubber. You will also get 
this result from other disinfecting products like hydrogen peroxide and 
rubbing alcohol. The best way I have found is a solution of 90% and 10% 
bleach (the stuff used for clothes, not that heavy-duty stuff). 
Submerge the mouthpiece in a glass with this for 2 minutes (too long 
and you will discolor the mouthpiece) and use a toothbrush to scrub off 
all of the junk that still sticks around.

            <pre class='message__body'>I am an instrument repair tech. I have joined this group and observed ans learned from all of the glorius discussions. 
   
   If you have the knowledge and ability to check and adjust your mouthpiece do it. 
   
   When your unit is back to spec, you might consider bringing it to a WELL ESTABLISHED tech, and ask to have it buffed with a hard rubber compound.
  If the appearence of it is important to your over all musical expierience.
