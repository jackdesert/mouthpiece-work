            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, thanks for helping with all my other questions! this is a great 
place.
My next questions is in regard to my dukoff d5 sop piece.  When the 
reed is placed against the table there is still about 2mm of the table 
showing on either side of the reed.  The reed is held on with a rovner 
lig which I have pretty tight but I&#39;m wondering whether I should file 
down the sides to the edge of the reed.  Would this have any benefit 
with the sealing and tone of the piece?
Thanks for your response in advance,

before I would take an metal off the piece.   It doesn&#39;t grow back.   :P

What becomes of a man
Who leaves behind the memory of youth
Instead of looking back to live again?

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Table on Dukoff Soprano


  Hi, thanks for helping with all my other questions! this is a great 
  place.
  My next questions is in regard to my dukoff d5 sop piece.  When the 
  reed is placed against the table there is still about 2mm of the table 
  showing on either side of the reed.  The reed is held on with a rovner 
  lig which I have pretty tight but I&#39;m wondering whether I should file 
  down the sides to the edge of the reed.  Would this have any benefit 
  with the sealing and tone of the piece?
  Thanks for your response in advance,

            <pre class='message__body'>The reed probably seals fine on the mouthpiece.  The main reason to trim
the sides is to make it easier to center the reed.  There may be some
slight articulation improvement by getting a good width match at the tip. 
On tenor and bari pieces, wide rails can cause gurgling air leaks on each
side at the players lower lip.
