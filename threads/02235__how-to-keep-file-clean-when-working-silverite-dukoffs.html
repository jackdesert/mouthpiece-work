            <pre class='message__body'>My files gum up with the soft Silverite material and a file brush 
won&#39;t clean it out.  I always have to take an x-acto knife and clean 
each tooth of the file (tedious).  Is there a good way to keep the 
file clean?  

thanks for suggestions.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just bought a set of diamond needle files and I was avoiding using 
them on the Dukoffs because they don&#39;t have any regular grooves to 
clean out if they get clogged.  But I am experimenting using water as 
a lubricant and so far, as long as I keep the files and piece wet 
with water, I have had good luck the files not getting clogged with 
silverite material.  

I had experimented with normal files and water before - it seemed to 
prevent the clogging but it rusts those files in a hurry.  The 
diamond files seem to be on a chrome or stainless body so they don&#39;t 
rust.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a set of diamond files too.  I have not tried them on Dukoffs.  I
got them to work on Stainless Steel to keep from dulling my regular files. 
However, they make deep scratches which are difficult to finish out.  This
would be less of a problem in Silverite.

I have not worked on any silverite pieces (Mojo did mine before I 
recently have delved into MP mods). However, I work with aluminum a 
bit...I use a good lubricant, either a silicone or a penetrating oil, 
on the file and it makes the stuff release a lot easier. I also use a 
fine stainless rather than a standard brass file brush, which works 
better.
