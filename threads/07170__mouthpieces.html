            <pre class='message__body'>Appreciate your willingness to inhibit unhelpful myths.

What are some good examples that you&#39;d like to share here on this forum?

            <pre class='message__body'>Suggest you get a copy of Prof. Weinberg&#39;s book, "Mouthpieces - What You Need To Know", available from Dawkes Music Ltd.  That should answer your questions.

            <pre class='message__body'>I didn&#39;t post any particular questions to Prof. Weinberg. I invited him
simply to share something that might be of interest to the crew here.

This is a forum where people ask questions and share knowledge. And a very
fine forum it is! (Tip o&#39; the hat to Mojo).

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d like to welcome Professor Anton Weinberg to MouthpieceWork on behalf of members who look forward to what he has to say, and might be interested in reading his book as well, which is the reason I mentioned it since it isn&#39;t yet well-known in the U.S.  As a world-wide Performer, Lecturer, recipient of a Presidential Citation for his contributions to education, designer of many commercially-successful mouthpieces, and someone who was described by Lord Yehudi Menuhin as "brilliant", it was very generous of him to offer assistance to group members.  He&#39;s very approachable, more than willing to help, and has quite a sense of humor.  It&#39;s unfortunate that he had to be involved in a fit of pique about what a "forum" is.  Welcome, Professor Weinberg, and I hope that many members take advantage of your very generous offer.

thankyou for the most flattering intro.:  incidentally there was no fit
of pique-- i use language a little differently than my American and
Canadian friends ( i discovered this when i was Prof of Music at
Indiana) so you will have to accept my straight talking and entirely
honest approach- which i beleive to be an essential part of an educators
responsibility> anyway it will, no doubt be amusing for us all and
hopefully give us a laugh.
