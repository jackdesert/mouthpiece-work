This is a forum where people ask questions and share knowledge. And a very
fine forum it is! (Tip o&#39; the hat to Mojo).

thankyou for the most flattering intro.:  incidentally there was no fit
of pique-- i use language a little differently than my American and
Canadian friends ( i discovered this when i was Prof of Music at
Indiana) so you will have to accept my straight talking and entirely
honest approach- which i beleive to be an essential part of an educators

hopefully give us a laugh.
