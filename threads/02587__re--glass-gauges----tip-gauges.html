As far as Tip gauges go...  Do yourself a favor and request the two 
different ones.  They make one long one - but it is a pain in the 
neck when trying to measure Clarinet, and Soprano Sax.

  I use the two Seperate gauges: the Small one goes from .35 to .80
and the bigger one goes from .80 to .125 ...

  Last I ordered a set ...

Glass - 20
Small wand - 20
Big Wand - 20

   All together $65 with shipping.  I got them before my check even 
cleared...
