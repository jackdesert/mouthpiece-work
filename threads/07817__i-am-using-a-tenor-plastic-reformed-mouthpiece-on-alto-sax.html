            <pre class='message__body'>I guys, i am using a tenor plastic common reformed mouthpiece on
alto sax. That mouthp. was refacing for me. I constantly probe all possibilities of reeds, mouthp., necks particularities by enhance the sound and blowing.
I believe that this combination mouthpiece, reed, ligature are perfect for this vintage instrument, a Getzen alto, manufactured by A. Rampone in Italia in the fifthing era.
The proper mouthpiece of this instrument was something difficult of toning on down notes; but with this tenor mouthp. all change on it.
May be that the reed is a Vandoren Java 2Â½ perfectly cured and tune-up.
I don&#39;t know; but this combination are exactly that i waited encounter it.
Logically the mouthpiece back part nearly touch the octave tone hole of the neck :o) But the result was surprising for me.
Other item that i had solutioned is altissimo notes, are very easy of to play in relation other alto mouthpiece.
Fraternally yours.
