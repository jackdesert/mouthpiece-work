Well...THAT was interesting. However, almost all of it was well over my head.

Keith&#39;s point is well taken. A lot of the time, what makes sense theoretically fails 
miserably when put into practice, and quite often the seat-of-the-pants approach 
works once in a million tries. Too many variables!

But either way represents a good starting point, so here&#39;s the plan:

I&#39;ll find and try a larger chamber mouthpiece and see what happens with the tuning. I 
may also get the neck recorked and retest some of my small-chamber pieces which 
normally play too sharp to use in public, just to compare them once again with my 
Meyers.

Steve&#39;s comment about different octave pips was interesting, but I don&#39;t care to invest 
in something that may or may not work. Perhaps it would be worth a bit just to pull 
the pips off and have them thoroughly cleaned and reinstalled. Maybe I&#39;ll also revisit 
the tone hole crescents idea. When I used them before, they covered only the upper 
edges of the tone holes as was suggested.

The crook on this horn has perhaps one or two very shallow quarter-inch dings, so 
maybe they&#39;re not affecting intonation at all. I&#39;m just looking for any and all 
possibilities.

Interesting that these particular notes seem to be troublesome on most Martins, and 
that Martin never changed the original design to correct the problem. Maybe the 
design engineers were too stubborn to listen to the seat-of-the-pants guys. Or vice 
versa!

Thanks to all for the input. If some of these things work, I&#39;ll spread the word.

Happy New Year!

            <pre class='message__body'>I had an old Handcraft that had excellent intonation except for the side C, which was a good 30 cents sharp. Now you would think that somebody would have noticed and moved the tonehole a bit, but no...

Bottom line is that there is a lot of inertia in manufacturing, and as long as sales are OK nobody wants the expense of retooling. 

Seat-of-the-pants has worked pretty well in instrument design--amazingly well in the case of the violin. As Nederveen points out however, science has a few suggestions to make regarding woodwinds, which have yet to be implemented.

One more idea for your checklist:
You may want to check to if some tone hole covers open much wider now 
than they used to do 40 years ago? What if replaced pads are not so 
thick now as original ones and the maximum clearance is wider?

That&#39;s a good question. Most of the info I&#39;ve seen is that the 
original pads on Martin horns were quite thin...so you would think 
that a thicker pad would actually lower the pitch a bit. Not a 
problem on this horn, as it&#39;s got kangaroo pads with flat metal 
resos. We&#39;ve tried lowering the key heights but all that does is make 
those notes stuffy.

I&#39;ve got a large chamber mouthpiece coming in this week and we&#39;ll see 
if that has any effect at all. Thanks for the idea!
