            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everyone. I want to thank everybody who's posted in this group. And I'd like to especially thank Mojo for starting it. I've been learning to reface for a little while and the info here has been HUGE in helping me.
 I've been trying to find good deals on pieces online to get practice measuring and making adjustments when needed. I recently picked up a selmer cheap and it turns out to have been already refaced. It's inscribed "Wolfe" on the shank. I can't find any pics online of his signed work, but I'm assuming it's Wolfe Tayne, can anybody confirm this for me? I've attached a photo.
 

 Thanks,
 -Ryan-
