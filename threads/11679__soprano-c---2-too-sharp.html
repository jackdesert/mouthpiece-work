            <pre class='message__body'>That combination is not typical of mouthpiece induced pitch problems alone.  There have to be other factors involved - octave key regulation, venting irregularities, etc., or the discription isn&#39;t entirely accurate.  Have to hear some audio to say anything.  Can you provide a listening link?

            <pre class='message__body'>Yep; one for the repairer...

OP...I believe the key above the C# hole on this model is a normal key (cup
with pad)
On a subsequent model, (Custom), I&#39;m sure Yamaha introduced a &#39;split&#39; C#
key,
a &#39;ring&#39; underneath the C# pad, which descends to &#39;cover&#39; the C# hole when
the octave key is depressed.

I&#39;m pretty confident that your problem lies with the lack, or adjustment
of, this ring.
With the octave key depressed, the ring should descend (not the pad cup),
with the ring &#39;seating&#39; on the tone hole..

I&#39;d call your local Yamaha Distribution Centre (where the retailers get
their instruments...it might be far...if you&#39;re in San Francisco, it may be
Los Angeles...), to seek their advice on modifying the instrument in the
way described above.
They usually have good technicians on site, and if your friend can&#39;t get to
them, they can at least advise your friend&#39;s repair technician if they have
a query...

They&#39;ve advised me before...very helpful.

Good luck.

David.

octave key depressed).

(but I still think it&#39;s a venting issue)

            <pre class='message__body'>If C#2 is sharp, that is unusual.  That note, written on the third space of the treble staff, is usually flat.

If C#3 is sharp, that is common.  That note is written on the second leger line above the staff.

What is written below all depends on producing the correct embouchure pressure.

The lower register tunes by mouthpiece volume.  But the upper register tunes by both volume and LENGTH of chamber.  Using a "large chamber" mouthpiece, whether on soprano or bass saxophone, results in having to push the mouthpiece in too far, shortening the air column.  This causes the top notes to become progressively sharper, beginning sometimes as low as upper register A.

Using an extremely small chamber mouthpiece results in having to pull the mouthpiece out excessively in order to tune C2 (third space) or B2 (third line).  Then the length of the mouthpiece causes the top notes of the upper register to be flat.

The mouthpiece volume to tuned length ratio must be correct.

Some years ago I modified a Selmer soprano mouthpiece with various chamber inserts, delrin rod drilled to be tubes of various lengths and inner diameter.  The bore of the mouthpiece was drilled from the butt end to lengthen the bore into the "throat" area of the mouthpiece.  The delrin tubes would slide in from the back and become the new "throat" and some would fill back into the bore a bit.

By removing the insert altogether a large chamber mouthpiece was created.  It had to be pushed onto the cork excessively far to tune the usual concert Bb (C2) tuning note, and the top notes of the upper register were very sharp, as described earlier.

By interchanging the inserts mouthpiece volume was adjusted and a "just right" solution was found, one that had perfect C2 to C3 octaves, C# on up to high F# played easily in tune.

You can repeat this experiment yourself and confirm or disprove what I have written.  I highly suggest you do this.  "Use a large chamber mouthpiece" is often bad advice.  Like Goldilocks', it has to be "just right".

Yes, but the effect of length vs. chamber volume on pitch is much greater in the upper register.

You can have the right volume (overblows good octave) in the low register, but if the length is wrong for the upper register, the low register pitch center will be off.

Yes, but the effect of chamber length upon pitch is much greater in the low register.  Try the experiment I described.  By obtaining the correct ratio of length to volume you can bring octaves right in tune.  As chamber volume goes up, the top end of the upper register becomes sharp in relation to the low register.  The opposite happens when the chamber volume is made smaller.
