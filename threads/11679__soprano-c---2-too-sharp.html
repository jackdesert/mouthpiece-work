OP...I believe the key above the C# hole on this model is a normal key (cup
with pad)
On a subsequent model, (Custom), I&#39;m sure Yamaha introduced a &#39;split&#39; C#
key,
a &#39;ring&#39; underneath the C# pad, which descends to &#39;cover&#39; the C# hole when
the octave key is depressed.

I&#39;m pretty confident that your problem lies with the lack, or adjustment
of, this ring.
With the octave key depressed, the ring should descend (not the pad cup),
with the ring &#39;seating&#39; on the tone hole..

I&#39;d call your local Yamaha Distribution Centre (where the retailers get
their instruments...it might be far...if you&#39;re in San Francisco, it may be
Los Angeles...), to seek their advice on modifying the instrument in the
way described above.
They usually have good technicians on site, and if your friend can&#39;t get to
them, they can at least advise your friend&#39;s repair technician if they have
a query...

They&#39;ve advised me before...very helpful.

Good luck.

David.

Yes, but the effect of length vs. chamber volume on pitch is much greater in the upper register.

Initial pitch is almost always overlooked

You can have the right volume (overblows good octave) in the low register, but if the length is wrong for the upper register, the low register pitch center will be off.

Yes, but the effect of chamber length upon pitch is much greater in the low register.  Try the experiment I described.  By obtaining the correct ratio of length to volume you can bring octaves right in tune.  As chamber volume goes up, the top end of the upper register becomes sharp in relation to the low register.  The opposite happens when the chamber volume is made smaller.
