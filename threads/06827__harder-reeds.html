On my Eb Clarinet, I&#39;ve had to get the Whitemaster to play it in tune and handle it.  That is the strength 4 for those.  So then because I&#39;m 40 to 50 cents flat on my Rousseau soprano saxophone mouthpiece, I was thinking of getting the V16 or ZZ Vandoren in a strength 4 to be able to play at least in tune.  Would this remedy my problem?  I am also using a Rovner ligature.

on sop but 4 on nino  I used to play 1/2 step harder. One thing I have  
noted consistently is that a fresh reed plays in tune but if I start  
playing a "pet" reed too long it tends to play sharp on the top 5th of  
the horn.  I could learn to compensate but I am actually talking about  
a reed that should be changed for fullness of sound and solid  
articulation reasons.  When I change it of course I always wonder why  
I waited because all the above things come good.  The intonation is  
usually the reason I finally realize that the reed is gone however.   
After 40 yrs you would have thought I would have learned already. JZ

a shorter barrel and pushing you sop mouthpiece on all the way to the end of
the bore.  Don&#39;t take it out on your lip.  Horns are built to play in tune
with a middle-of-the-road embochure playing a middle-of-the road reed about
halfway down the cork (about 1-1.5")

However, yeah, a V16 reed (or Java if you can find it) would allow you to
pinch as much as you want to in a higher strength.  I don&#39;t have alot of
confidence in the ZZ reed&#39;s ability to take the pressure - it feels thin
behind the tip to me.

Of course, if a reed is too soft (i.e. worn out), it will be hard to support it with your embouchure, and it will tend to go flat.  But that&#39;s just because "normal" pressure squeezes the reed shut.

            <pre class='message__body'>   Yes. When reeds get older the pitch tends to wander for me too in the high register. I think they are reeds that are "growing" some kind of bug. They start smelling rather funky and their performance varies from day to day.
   I think it was Tom Ridenour who had some old reeds cultured up in a friend&#39;s lab and found that they were growing some bug or other. Reeds must make a good culture medium. He reported this in  The Clarinet about 15years ago.
   Maybe we just need to change our diet or floss more often!   Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>-On clarinet especially so much of the intonation depends on mouth cavity, especially tongue placement. There is always a tendency to pull the tongue back to get that fatter sound. Unfortunately this is done at the expense of focus and pitch. There is  a happy medium that every player must find and after that compensate for with  a shorter barrel or a different mouthpiece. I don&#39;t think a stiffer reed will make much difference besides causing a sore or tired lip.
   The other factor in pitch of course is air support. It is always amazing how pushing the air through the horn a little more can focus the pitch with no other adjustment at all.  Peter

is less of a difference between a medium and a medium hard reed if any.
Also, the higher one places the tip of the reed above the tip of the
mouthpiece, the higher it plays. John
