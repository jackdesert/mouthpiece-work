            <pre class='message__body'>- Reed strength  never seemed to change my intonation. Perhaps it does for someone with a different embouchure. I was fortunate years ago to have a teacher convince me to get off the hard reeds and stick to the mediums.
 I still have at least 10 boxes of unopened Vandoren 5s for clarinet from 1977 if anyone is interested in buying them.  Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>It sounds to me like you&#39;re using lip pressure to compensate....try getting
a shorter barrel and pushing you sop mouthpiece on all the way to the end of
the bore.  Don&#39;t take it out on your lip.  Horns are built to play in tune
with a middle-of-the-road embochure playing a middle-of-the road reed about
halfway down the cork (about 1-1.5")

However, yeah, a V16 reed (or Java if you can find it) would allow you to
pinch as much as you want to in a higher strength.  I don&#39;t have alot of
confidence in the ZZ reed&#39;s ability to take the pressure - it feels thin
behind the tip to me.

Of course, if a reed is too soft (i.e. worn out), it will be hard to support it with your embouchure, and it will tend to go flat.  But that&#39;s just because "normal" pressure squeezes the reed shut.

            <pre class='message__body'>   Yes. When reeds get older the pitch tends to wander for me too in the high register. I think they are reeds that are "growing" some kind of bug. They start smelling rather funky and their performance varies from day to day.
   I think it was Tom Ridenour who had some old reeds cultured up in a friend&#39;s lab and found that they were growing some bug or other. Reeds must make a good culture medium. He reported this in  The Clarinet about 15years ago.
   Maybe we just need to change our diet or floss more often!   Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>-On clarinet especially so much of the intonation depends on mouth cavity, especially tongue placement. There is always a tendency to pull the tongue back to get that fatter sound. Unfortunately this is done at the expense of focus and pitch. There is  a happy medium that every player must find and after that compensate for with  a shorter barrel or a different mouthpiece. I don&#39;t think a stiffer reed will make much difference besides causing a sore or tired lip.
   The other factor in pitch of course is air support. It is always amazing how pushing the air through the horn a little more can focus the pitch with no other adjustment at all.  Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>If a reed is too soft, the pitch is generally a bit lower I find, but there
is less of a difference between a medium and a medium hard reed if any.
Also, the higher one places the tip of the reed above the tip of the
mouthpiece, the higher it plays. John
