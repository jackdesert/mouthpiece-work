It&#39;s a "Mike Carubba" clarinet mouthpiece. Is this the same Mike Carubba from Loyola University and treasurer (I think) of the New Orleans Musicians&#39; Local? 
 
He was my sax teacher at Loyola University back when the school of music was just a white two-story house on the corner of St. Charles Avenue and (I believe) State Street. He was always fooling with clarinet necks and drilling things. Great teacher. Patient too. He didn&#39;t flinch when he saw how I "refaced" my Selmer C*. (On a bench grinder!).
 
Anyone know anything about the distribution of this mouthpiece? I wasn&#39;t aware that he had his own mouthpiece line. What a week for New Orleans on the yahoo mouthpiece groups! First a Dick Stabile and now a Mike Carubba. Could there be an Earl Turbinton or a Charles Neville line too? Maybe a Rene Netto or a Gary Brown?
 
What&#39;s the poop on this one? Steve G? Mr. PC? Anyone?
