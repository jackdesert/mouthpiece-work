            <pre class='message__body'>I just spoke with Paul Coats, and he asked me to bring you up to date. I currently have power (although it has been on and off) and Paul does not. There is extremely heavy rain and flooding, high winds, etc., but not as severe as had been predicted. Looks like we&#39;re going to make it through this OK.
