Just bought a used Vandoren optimum BL4 legit playing and found that the table is not flat. Luckily, it wasn&#39;t that bad, and I flattened it easily without much effort with 1000 sandpaper. But now the facing length is too short. It measures as follows on the babbit gauge
0.0015  45
0.010    35
0.014  32
0.024   24.5
0.035   18.5

0.063    7.5
0.078    2.5

Tip measures 2.1mm and tip rail is 1.2mm

So what&#39;s a good recommendation for legit playing?

Also, I find that the Vandoren&#39;s window is quite wide.(17.2mm)
I measured the width of some reeds and found the following:
Fibracell  17.7mm
Bari premier 18.1mm
Rico orange 18.2mm
Vandoren blue 18.7mm

So it seems I&#39;m destined to use only Vandoren reeds?

            <pre class='message__body'>How long was the facing length before you started?  Did it feel OK there to you 
when playing?  I like bari facing lengths at 52-54.  But I only play ill-legit.

Most cane reeds seem to have fairly standard widths.  The Vandoren bari reeds 
are significantly wider than others as you have shown with your data.  Tip 
curves and rounded vs square-ish corners  vary more than reed width.

Hi Keith,
The original FL measured 48. I think it&#39;s original as there were machining marks on the table. It played Ok but response was a little slow.
I read somewhere on this forum that a medium facing would be 48-50. Maybe I should face it back to 48. Would an elliptical curve be better for classical pieces?

            <pre class='message__body'>I would start with an elliptical facing curve with an a/b ratio of 4.  Facing 
length 49.  If you have not faced a lot of mouthpieces, getting the facing 
really close to a target curve is more important than which type of curve you 
choose (within reason). 


If you are on a good curve (no bumps, flat spots or unevenness left to right), 
and the response is slow, then you can consider a different facing curve.  But 
try a few reeds first and/or adjust your reeds.

For better low note response, try a longer facing curve and/or a a/b ratio of 1 
to 2.  You may need to try a wider tip opening with that too since 2.1 mm = 
.083" on bari is pretty wimpy.

For faster articulation, you may want to try adding more resistance.  a/b ratios 
of 6-8 can be tried.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,
Thanks for the reply. The FL was 48 before I flattened the table. I think this could be original as there were still machining marks on the table. It played OK but no wow factor. 
I read elsewhere on this forum that a medium facing would be 48-50. I would certainly prefer a facing that responds well to fast articulation so often demanded by legit playing but not at the expense of the low end.
Would you think an elliptical curve would be better in this regard?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,
Thanks for replying. The FL was 48 before I started. There were machining marks on the table, so I assume it was un-molested before. (not sure about this, not having inspected a brand new BL4 before). The Vandoren catalog describes the BL4 as having medium facing with a tip opening of 2.3mm, although I have a feeling they are measuring the very end of the tip. The low end response was not as good although that may alos be due to the uneven table before I started measuring.
Read on SOTW that most BL4 users use vandoren reeds because of this reed width issue although a Legere might just fit.
