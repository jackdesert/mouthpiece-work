I&#39;ve seen a Morgan kit - a friend has one. The selection of gauges is 
limited, and IIRC correctly the tip wand is metric and only goes to 
2.2mm. 

If I made up a kit, I&#39;d get a tip gauge made up like that one Keith 
posted a pic of a few weeks ago, and package it with the feeler 
gauges Jeff Rosner had made up. Facing plates can be gotten from lots 
of different places (mine is too heavy to ship).

I&#39;d probably do like Ralph did and include a copy of the Brand 
refacing chapter, but I&#39;d supplement it with measurements of some 
current production pieces, esp. clarinet pieces. 

Another thing I&#39;d include in a kit these days would be some software -
 a dressed up version of Keith&#39;s radial arc facing curve 
generator...maybe even some demonstration video clips.

            <pre class='message__body'>Is there any way a complete novice can find a refacing kit for clarinet  
mouthpieces?  I don&#39;t even know what I need to get started.   I have a lot of old 
mouthpieces to work with.  I figure that I will mess up  a few to start.  Any 
help would be appreciated.

Check the files section here for suggested equipment.

For most clarinet work you&#39;ll only need feeler gauges ranging from 
0.0015" to 0.050".

You&#39;ll need a glass gauge. I got mine directly from JJ Babbitt - the 
address is in the file section somewhere.

My facing surface is a granite plate I got from Lee Valley tools.

A small half-round file (Nicholson miniature files #42030) and some 
fine abrasives (auto body supply place - get grits from 600-2000)

The pain with clarinets is finding info on good curves. I&#39;ve been 
amassing a database of my own from new Vandoren and Chedeville 
pieces, as well as local pros personal pieces.
