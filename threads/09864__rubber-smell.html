            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:
The stench of the mouthpiece can be removed with a few drops of an excellent 
disinfectant mouthwash called LISTERINE.
Plates eliminates bacteria that create odor and is bactericidal and 
germinicida;  

but I
Silveriothink that the smells are due to the mouthpiece and reed are not 
properly cleaned after each study session or musical performance.
If you put a few drops of Listerine in the dry cloth or feather duster every 
time you use it, you&#39;ll not have any more bad smell on your mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Make sure to not use Mi-T-Mist (Sanimist) on your plastic or rubber mouthpieces. I had a plastic clarinet mouthpiece develop a white haze before I read "Contains Alcohol. Do not use on rubber mouthpiece or other rubber based parts. May not be safe for some composite materials." Apparently, it is an isopropanol-based spray - NOT good for drinking! I have had no discoloration issues with Sterisol Germicide, but I&#39;d like to see if it kills germs as well as Listerine or the bleach mix. 

Thanks for posting about you experiences with Ethanol based products!

            <pre class='message__body'>Gee, we sell GALLONS of Mi-Ti-Mist
and I have never seen or heard of any problem like that.  And even if it is not good for rubber, it should have no effect on plastic.
