            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:
The stench of the mouthpiece can be removed with a few drops of an excellent 
disinfectant mouthwash called LISTERINE.
Plates eliminates bacteria that create odor and is bactericidal and 
germinicida;  

but I
Silveriothink that the smells are due to the mouthpiece and reed are not 
properly cleaned after each study session or musical performance.
If you put a few drops of Listerine in the dry cloth or feather duster every 
time you use it, you&#39;ll not have any more bad smell on your mouthpiece.

I had a plastic clarinet mouthpiece develop a white haze before I read "Contains Alcohol. Do not use on rubber mouthpiece or other rubber based parts. May not be safe for some composite materials."

I have had no discoloration issues with Sterisol Germicide, but I&#39;d like to see if it kills germs as well as Listerine or the bleach mix. 

Thanks for posting about you experiences with Ethanol based products!

Make sure to not use Mi-T-Mist (Sanimist) on your plastic or rubber mouthpieces. I had a plastic clarinet mouthpiece develop a white haze before I read "Contains Alcohol. Do not use on rubber mouthpiece or other rubber based parts. May not be safe for some composite materials." Apparently, it is an isopropanol-based spray - NOT good for drinking! I have had no discoloration issues with Sterisol Germicide, but I'd like to see if it kills germs as well as Listerine or the bleach mix.
