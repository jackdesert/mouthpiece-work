The performer had to stand on a stool. I&#39;ll see if I can find it. Somebody
told me (maybe Prof. Paul Cohen?) that the original straight bari still
exists.

 I asked about straight tube alto and tenor saxes and Steve Goodson provided
some valuable information based on his knowledge and experience with these
rather unusual examples of the saxophone makers art. While surfing the web
on a matter unrelated to this topic, I came across the following example of
an even more unusual example of the straight tube sax, namely this baritone
sax, pictured below. One can well imagine the difficulties of attempting to
play such a behemoth.. For those you might be interested in such a saxophone
curiosity, more can be found at the following link:
