            <pre class='message__body'> I asked about straight tube alto and tenor saxes and Steve Goodson provided some valuable information based on his knowledge and experience with these rather unusual examples of the saxophone makers art. While surfing the web on a matter unrelated to this topic, I came across the following example of an even more unusual example of the straight tube sax, namely this baritone sax, pictured below. One can well imagine the difficulties of attempting to play such a behemoth.. For those you might be interested in such a saxophone curiosity, more can be found at the following link:

I&#39;ve got a video somewhere in my files of the straight bari being played.
The performer had to stand on a stool. I&#39;ll see if I can find it. Somebody
told me (maybe Prof. Paul Cohen?) that the original straight bari still
exists.
