            <pre class='message__body'>I have come into possession of an older Berg Larsen bronze bari piece
105/1 that plays quite well. Only problem is that the bore size is
18.3 mm, while all of my other pieces (I&#39;ve opened some slightly) have
been setup to 17.4 mm, which seems to be the standard bore for Links.

Has anyone ever tried to shrink a bore by this much? I have used thin
coats of epoxy  before for downsizing by as much as 0.25 mm. Does this
work for a whole millimeter? 

Any tips before I go ahead? Choice of epoxy or other material?
Technique? Does it matter to &#39;taper&#39; the applied epoxy to smoothly
transition into the large chamber?

I think we should constantly be monitoring the risks of epoxy.  New info
comes out every year.

I think reducing the shank bore is far enough downstream that you could
probably even use a toxic material.  But I think that the epoxies I use are
safe when mixed and cured.
