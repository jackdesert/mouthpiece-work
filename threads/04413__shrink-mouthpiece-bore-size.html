            <pre class='message__body'>I have come into possession of an older Berg Larsen bronze bari piece
105/1 that plays quite well. Only problem is that the bore size is
18.3 mm, while all of my other pieces (I&#39;ve opened some slightly) have
been setup to 17.4 mm, which seems to be the standard bore for Links.

Has anyone ever tried to shrink a bore by this much? I have used thin
coats of epoxy  before for downsizing by as much as 0.25 mm. Does this
work for a whole millimeter? 

Any tips before I go ahead? Choice of epoxy or other material?
Technique? Does it matter to &#39;taper&#39; the applied epoxy to smoothly
transition into the large chamber?

            <pre class='message__body'>Most of my reduction jobs are .010" = ~.25 mm.  .005" is hardly worth
doing.  I&#39;ve occasionally done .020".  I use a clear 5-min epoxy but it

use 1-2 coats for .010".  I use a high speed sanding drum to shape it to
size.  Checking with calipers along the way.

I know, I&#39;m going to open that thread again.

I think we should constantly be monitoring the risks of epoxy.  New info
comes out every year.

I think reducing the shank bore is far enough downstream that you could
probably even use a toxic material.  But I think that the epoxies I use are
safe when mixed and cured.
