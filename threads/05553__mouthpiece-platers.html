replating some mouthpieces for a couple of clients.  One a Link STM and

            <pre class='message__body'>I have some experience with doing my own plating of mouthpieces from a few  
years back when I was a repair tech. The problem with plating mouthpieces and  
destroying bite plates is that in order to get a decent finish in the plating  
(especially on something like a dukoff with there dull finish) you need to 
buff  the mouthpiece before plating it. I&#39;ve gathered that most manufacturers  
plate  (or at least buff) there mouthpieces before installing the bite  plates. 
I guess you (or whoever does it for you) may be able to leave the  edges 
along the bite plate un buffed and/or maybe tape up the bite plate before  buffing.

            <pre class='message__body'>I usually start with paper, and remove most of what&#39;s left of the 
plating that way.  I guess most of the pieces I&#39;ve been asked to 
have replated are almost barren or a good part of the way barren of 
plating already.  I use buffing mainly as a way to polish, gets a 
more cohesive finish that even fine paper.  Keep in mind that I&#39;ve 
been using the buff wheel on mouthpieces for production for over a 
dozen years, so I&#39;ve got a pretty good touch with it, and wouldn&#39;t 
want to have to buff so hard as to have to remove a bunch of 
plating.  One thing Anderson won&#39;t do is any kind of spot 
replating.  Are you still working in replating, Keith?  I&#39;d love to 
learn it someday.
thanks,
Brian

I dabbled in it enough to know that I do not want to scale up and get into
it farther at this time.  At the hobby level, it was a lot of fun to get
results with a small set-up.  But the supplies cost and hours I would put
in to just get 1-2 MPs plated were more than I could justify charging
someone.   My available hours are already maxed out so I do not need to
offer another service.

Dave Jary was offering a spot plating service as part of his reworks.  If I
had an easier way to mask off the areas that need plating, I might try
again.  I might try varnish (polyurethane).

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

I&#39;m new around here and I suppose you guys have forgotten more than I will ever know when it comes to mouthpiece work.  Never-the-less.....the subject intrigues me and I look forward to learning all I can.  I did some hunting around on YouTube and this is what I found:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2VIqdmIdc4

I play on a Guardala Crescent and it sounds very much like what this gentlemen is playing.  You be the judge.....

I payed a pretty penny for my piece and would be willing to try these to save a buck or two (different baffle/facing experiments).

Thanks all for your time.....

Mike

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, a copy is supposed to look and play like the real deal......the last

Steve,

I&#39;m new around here and I suppose you guys have forgotten more than I will
ever know when it comes to mouthpiece work.  Never-the-less.....the subject
intrigues me and I look forward to learning all I can.  I did some hunting
around on YouTube and this is what I found:

http://www.youtube. &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2VIqdmIdc4>
com/watch?v=y2VIqdmIdc4

I play on a Guardala Crescent and it sounds very much like what this
gentlemen is playing.  You be the judge.....

I payed a pretty penny for my piece and would be willing to try these to
save a buck or two (different baffle/facing experiments).

Thanks all for your time.....

Mike

I saw on UTUBE a guy playing what he says in a China made Guardala
mouthpiece copy. Does anyone know anything about these?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hello, again, everyone. I&#39;m back. (For awhile at least!)

Yes, I have been ill and will continue to be so on and off for the 
rest of my life. My work had pretty much come to a complete halt, but 
Kathy and I are starting to work a few hours a week.

Anyway, I can and do plate mouthpieces and keys, ligatures, etc. in 
copper, nickel (Electroless and standard Watts baths), bright silver 
(no buffing required after plating), and bright gold. I generally use 
a heavy silver plate under the gold, but some people prefer nickel 
and I can oblige.

I can strip silver or nickel from pieces without damage (usually!)and 
I still make a new version of my Tip Gauge which is now availble with 
a Metric Dial Indicator for a little more money. I have about 6 or 7 
made that are available right now.

As far as touchup goes, I can touchup 24 and 18 Karat gold, silver 
and nickel with excellent results, although it is usually better to 
strip and replate.

Thanks to all of you that inquired about my work and my health. I 
appreciate it.

Steve,

I&#39;m new around here and I suppose you guys have forgotten more than I will ever know when it comes to mouthpiece work.  Never-the-less. ....the subject intrigues me and I look forward to learning all I can.  I did some hunting around on YouTube and this is what I found:

http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=y2VIqdmIdc4

I play on a Guardala Crescent and it sounds very much like what this gentlemen is playing.  You be the judge.....

I payed a pretty penny for my piece and would be willing to try these to save a buck or two (different baffle/facing experiments) .

Thanks all for your
 time.....

Mike

has anyone had one of these pieces tested for lead content by a reputible 3rd party? 
 
if they can&#39;t make a safe action figure, why would you think they can make a safe mouthpiece.  
 
even at 5 cents a piece, the cost might be too high.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is a good point, indeed.

I&#39;m sitting in Beijing in the moment. We have just passed through a bottled water scandal. Since the tap water is undrinkable, most people have water coolers in their home using bottled water. It now appears that up to 90% of certain brands of water is "counterfeit", with unscrupulous dealers
 filling bottles from the tap and worse. The food is totally scary, as there are no effective controls on the use of pesticides, additives, etc., beyond which, many of the additives that *are* permitted have been banned in the West for many years.

Chinese copies of various things often look almost perfect on the outside, but the story is quite different for what cannot be seen in them.

I would be very wary about putting anything made of metal from China in my mouth.

 if they can&#39;t make a safe action figure, why would you think they can make a safe mouthpiece.  
  
 even at 5 cents a piece, the cost might be too high.

Wow,  but I guess it depends on where you eat lunch!  
Are you reselling them? How much? Where can I order one?
What sizes do you have (any 7*  .105)?

Steve,

I&#39;m new around here and I suppose you guys have forgotten more than I will
ever know when it comes to mouthpiece work.  Never-the-less.....the subject
intrigues me and I look forward to learning all I can.  I did some hunting
around on YouTube and this is what I found:

http://www.youtube. &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2VIqdmIdc4>
com/watch?v=y2VIqdmIdc4

I play on a Guardala Crescent and it sounds very much like what this
gentlemen is playing.  You be the judge.....

I payed a pretty penny for my piece and would be willing to try these to
save a buck or two (different baffle/facing experiments).

Thanks all for your time.....

Mike

There&#39;s no paint here.

has anyone had one of these pieces tested for lead content by a reputible
3rd party? 
 
if they can&#39;t make a safe action figure, why would you think they can make a
safe mouthpiece.  
 
even at 5 cents a piece, the cost might be too high.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ok, I&#39;ve done a poor job of communicating. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going on. I keep
forgetting that many members of this group don&#39;t know much about me and the
various aspects of the music business I&#39;m involved with.
 

I&#39;m Vice President in charge of product design and manufacturing for Orpheus
Music. We manufacture musical instruments and accessories. We source
products from many different nations, including the USA, some in Europe, and
some in Asia. I&#39;ve been importing products to the USA for many years, and
have many contacts all around the world. Manufacturers regularly send me
products to evaluate in hopes that I may buy some for resale. I get
mouthpieces, horns, reeds, etc. etc. etc. as samples all the time. Some of
the products that I like I may have changed, or I may put my brand on them
and resell them. This is how I came by these mouthpieces.
 
At this time, I have no plans to import them and sell them. I&#39;m currently
selling mouthpieces under my Saxgourmet brand (two models) and Steve Goodson
Model (also two versions). Early next year, I will introduce several new
Saxgourmet models. I still make, when time permits, hand made mouthpieces.
 

I&#39;m not in the business of selling Guardala copies, no matter how good they
are. I&#39;m not going to arrange for a group purchase of these because I don&#39;t
have the time nor the inclination to administer it. I&#39;m not going to reveal
the vendor because I currently have a business relationship with the
company, and my vendors and sources are a closely guarded secret. This is
not what some of you wish to hear, but that&#39;s the way it is.

Ok, I&#39;ve done a poor job of communicating. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going on. I keep

mouthpieces, horns, reeds, etc. etc. etc. as samples all the time. Some of
the products that I like I may have changed, or I may put my brand on them
and resell them. This is how I came by these mouthpieces.
 
At this time, I have no plans to import them and sell them. I&#39;m currently
selling mouthpieces under my Saxgourmet brand (two models) and Steve Goodson

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear David,
I must say, coming also from the "old country Europe", I was under 
the impression that a civilised form of communication was a 
worldwide thing. But as you pointed out so very rightly, not for all 
of mankind and you don&#39;t have to be sorry for your remark.
I fully support your point, on the otherhand, not everybody using 
the computer knows how to change the color of the text in emails. So 
there may be an excuse.
