            <pre class='message__body'>Bizarre.  The patent was issued in 1950 and so has long since expired.  I&#39;ve never seen or heard of anything like it.

Like almost all patent applications (IAAL), this one is long on theory (much of which seems nonsensical) and short on details.  I wonder whether the inventor ever made even a prototype.

Anyone up for a really BIG challenge?

            <pre class='message__body'>Like many mouthpiece patents, this one is based upon plumber&#39;s common sense acoustics - wind tunnel and air reed, referee&#39;s whistle analogies - which have lttle to do with what is actually going on.  Had the inventor been interested in functionality rather than marketable novelty, and actually attempted to make "working" prototypes prior to filing with the UPSO, I&#39;m inclinded to believe he would have spared himself the patent application fee.
