Hi, ive got an ARB alto mouthpiece with a pretty big chip in the tip. I was wondering if anyone had any good suggestions as to what kind of epoxy to use, and if it would be safe to use epoxy since it will be in my mouth all of the time. Maybe some techniques on how to perform this kind of repair. Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>I´ve restored a couple of very bad tips, with odontologic acrylic resin. It binds very well to hard rubber mouthpieces. I haven´t yet tryed on plastic polymer mouthpieces. It is quite a bit difficult to shape for its short setting time. But after it is hard, you can shape it by sanding or with a rotary tool. Is is suitable for big chips repairs.
