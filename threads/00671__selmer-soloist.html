            <pre class='message__body'>Welcome, Gilles!  Hey, guys!  You know how on Sax On The Web, you can
download Tim Price�s sheet music lessons, and from me, Arcanum, and I
know a few of you have received sheet music from me in pdf format.
Well, Gilles is the fellow that showed me how to do this!  He has a
great site about Cannonball Adderley.  I think it is no secret� In MY
opinion, Cannonball was the greatest saxophonist throughout the entire
Space-Time Continuum!  Well, Gilles has transcriptions of some of
Cannonball�s most famous solos in pdf format (Adobe Acrobat Reader) on
his site.  So, I wrote him, and he took me through the process step by
step.

Gilles, please put your Cannonball URL on here for all of us!
