Hey all - it&#39;s been very interesting checking out everyone&#39;s
ideas/opinions/resources about the importance (or lack thereof) of the
material a mouthpiece or instrument is made out of.

Although it seems pretty clear from the current research that material
is negligable there are definite examples that make us feel as if we are
experiencing other wise.

The best I can think if is plastic vs wood clarinets.  I think all
clarinetists would agree that you MUST have a wood clarinet to get the
desried sound for an orchestra.  And it does seem to the ear that
plastic clarinets do not achieve as robust a sound as their wood
counterparts.  I have a hard time believing that it is merely a better
bore improving the sound.  If there was an R13 made out of plastic would
it sound the same?  One would guess not.

With mouthpieces, I can understand the material being negligable since
it is a smaller part of the resonating body of the instrument.  But when
you apply this clarinet example to that of the brass in a saxophone,
doesn&#39;t it seem to imply that the material will have more of an effect
than some of us think?

I&#39;m definitely not convinced either way on this issue - just wanted to
add this example.

            <pre class='message__body'>In any instrument where the material is not supposed to vibrate to 
produce the sound, the material will have very little contribution to 
the sound.  However, I think the jury will always be out on this, 
because of the subjective nature of musicians.  No matter how much 
proof is presented, there will always be opinions from musicians to 
the contrary. Bird played on a plastic sax and I don&#39;t think too many 
people complained.

Thanks, Ken

By the way, I have nothing against hard rubber
clarinets, and I don&#39;t claim they are not as good as
wood. I have no opinion on them since I&#39;ve never
played one.

  Hey all - it&#39;s been very interesting checking out everyone&#39;s ideas/opinions/resources about the importance (or lack thereof) of the material a mouthpiece or instrument is made out of.

  Although it seems pretty clear from the current research that material is negligable there are definite examples that make us feel as if we are experiencing other wise.

  The best I can think if is plastic vs wood clarinets.  I think all clarinetists would agree that you MUST have a wood clarinet to get the desried sound for an orchestra.

Lars-

No offense, but unless your store is staffed with professional
orchestral clarinetists this is hardly a good survey.  I&#39;m not one
myself, but I can surely guarantee you that top clarinetists whose ears
are tuned for this sort of thing would be able to tell the difference -
otherwise, we&#39;d have at least ONE non-wood clarinet in a major symphony
in the world.



However, I ami interested in your statement that woodwind bodies do not
resonate sympathetically - is this fact or opinion?   If it is fact, can
you provide some data to back it up?  That would help clear the debate!!

            <pre class='message__body'>I have the perception that before the web, virtually no one 
questioned whether materials made a sonic difference in instruments 
and mouthpieces.  Every teacher, repair shop, store and musician 
seemed to be preaching the same dogma.  If there were any nay-sayers, 
I never got to hear their voice.  We all loved the emperor&#39;s new 
cloths.  Same thing with open-holed flutes...

I think the web has allowed the few studies that have been done to 
circulate around the world fast.  Also, they remain accessible to 
search engines for new players surfing the web.

As with many debates, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle.  
Material matters, but way less than many people think.  Or, it 
matters a significant amount in ergonomics (feel) but not 
sonically... directly.

In the case of mouthpieces.  I generally do not think it matters 
until the wall thickness is sufficiently thin enough to bring out the 
effect.  My Delrin Quantums sound different than metal Quantums.  
Quantums have thin beaks.  Ralph Morgan believes his thin-wall 
Excaliber line resonates differently.  So do many players.  I think 
Plastic Dukoffs sound like metal Dukoffs.  Same with metal vs HR 
RIAs.  But you sure do know which one is in your mouth.  You can not 
have a perfect blind play test if you can feel the material 
differences.  You can have a lister judge but if they hear a 
difference it might be that the player favors the feel of metal over 
plastic and plays them differently.  But the few scientific tests we 
have do show that the listener can not tell the difference.

You wrote Bird played on a plastic sax and I don&#39;t think too many people complained
 ... but the good ears complained with the pawnshop that keep the naked lady for money... Do you think C.P. was happy to play on a plastic sax? 
 I think he play it because pawnshops dont give money for plastic...
 ___________________________________________________________
 
 Anyway we are talking about material, so I want to compare the sax brass with the cymbal brass. I got experience on cymbals in plus than 30 years playing drums. I got too a good experience with Paiste, 20 years ago I was kind of  demonstrator in Italy when there are not yet the workshops. 
 
 If is true, as most of you said, materials don&#39;t change the sound of mouthpiece, but only the design is responsable of the change, maybe this is true for mouthpiece, but it is absolutely not true for the cymbals.
 
 When only a 3 or 4% of silver is added on a cymbals of same size, thickness and quality, the sound come out brighter and you can compare and feel the difference. And I remember when Zildijan come out with a bronze not finished ride cymbal called Earth. No one of them had same tone, but more important... I was able to change tone playing the stick on different areas where different material not well blended were out.
 
 So my conclusion is to turn the point on other side, the new question is now: change of sound due to material can happen only on small sites as a mouthpiece? I&#39;d like to see the spectrum of the wave running inside (as a wind gallery) on different materials.
 Mostly of you said a wave reflected inside a mouthpiece don&#39;t change on different material but only the design push the wave in different way. 
 So my question is: why sound change on the bigger area of the body when I use a metal resonator instead of a plastic resonator or a rivet, even if pads are made by same factory? and the cymbals too are the best example.
 
 Now I&#39;m confused. Mostly of you said on this blog material don&#39;t affect the sound of the mouthpiece, but I know material give a different sound on any instrument.
 Do you think the material can change the sound only on big volume area but not in a small? Ritenour said HR is like wood... ummmm?!?!
 
 I just have in my mind how is hard to play a wood mouthpiece respect the same model in Hard Rubber (see Lebayle for example...).

 because of the subjective nature of musicians.  No matter how much 
 proof is presented, there will always be opinions from musicians to 
 the contrary.Bird played on a plastic sax and I don&#39;t think too many

            <pre class='message__body'>This has been shown to be a fact, in that, the amount of energy produced in woodwinds (which is measurable) is FAR below that which is required to cause the body of all woodwinds to vibrate sympathetically or couple with the vibrating column of air. This has been shown by Rossi, Benade, Coltman, and others, through independent and scientific research. In the case of VERY thin mouthpieces (i.e. some thin-wall flutes,  bassoon bocals, and some very thin sax necks) there may be a very small amount of measurable sympathetic vibration in a small portion of the initial length of the m.p. tube. As too having to be a professional orchestral clarinetist to be able to have a valid opinion, well, I think this is a bit arrogant. - Lars

            <pre class='message__body'>You can not bring the vibration of cymbals into a discussion of wind
instruments.  

In a sax, it is the column of air that is vibrating as a standing wave with
the help of the reed to sustain this vibration.  Soft pads can dampen this
sound by absorbing a significant amount of the accoustic energy.

Also, I think you were asking about frequency spectrums for different
materials?  This comparison is included for the paper on plastic vs metal
Dukoffs.  There is a link to it on the MP Work site.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the info on the resonating bodies - that seems like it 
should put the debate to bed.

The next question would be what causes the sensation to the performer 
of difference in sound in instrument material.  With mouthpieces it 
seems to be accounted for by difference in size/shape of the mouthpiece 
as opposed to material (i.e. thinner metal mouthpieces vs fatter HR).  
With instruments, what can account for the very different quality of 
sound between a Silver Mark VI and a Lacquer Mark VI (that one is 
undeniable! and with identical design).

As for arrogance - It is not arrogant to suggest that Mark Nuccio, 
Robert Marcellus, Ricardo Morales, Bil Jackson, David Schiffrin, or 
Larry Combs will have a keener ear for the clarinet than the people 
working in your store.  Let&#39;s all give respect to those who have taken 
the craft to a high level!!

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry but that MarkVI different is deniable, and it is
easy to say why there is a difference. There are two
reasons. One is that the design of two MarkVI or any
two horns is not 100%. Maybe it is in theory, but you
must have the same goo repairer make them as identical
as possible. A small difference in pad heights, and
even pads and resonators type will make a huge
difference in comparison to the plating. Also are you
sure those MarkVI saxes are the same design? I won&#39;t
be surprised at all that the actual design (tone hole
placement, bore, etc.) was slightly changed over the
years of the MarkVI production.

The other explanation is even simpler - psychology!
and those excellent clarinet players that you
mentioned are not less likely to be affected by
psychology than anyone else (from my experience it has
more to do with anyone specific personality than
playing ability).

To the person who said a plastic R13 would sound
different than the regular wood R13 - you are probably
right. But, also two wood R13 clarinets can sound
different. If you meant the plastic won&#39;t sound as 
good, then I think you are wrong. If Buffet made a few
plastic R13 and built them in the same quality as
their wood ones and made a blindfold test, I doubt
anyone could identify which is which (as long as the
players themselves can&#39;t tell by feel which clarinet
they are playing, which means they have to make the
mabout same weight, etc).

Wait! Actually Buffet have done something similar,
with their Greenline clarinets! I have played the
Buffet Bb models Festival, RC, RC Prestige, Tosca, two
of each in wood and two of each in Greenline (and even
more A clarinets in wood and Greenline) and there was
absolutely no difference that was just between the
wood and Greenline. For example, there was a
difference bettwen a wood RC and a Greenline RC, but
not bigger than between the two wood RC clarinets
(giving the RC model as example, this happened with
most models).

  And even if A is different from B, so what?  Does that mean that A is better than B?
   
  I did some tests about 10 yrs ago.  I had some non musicians listen to me play from behind a screen (really, a rollaround blackboard).  
   
  We all have heard some people go on and on about the desirability of having a "dark" tone, by which they meant a tone strong in fundamental and the lower overtons, and less of the high overtones.
   
  I played several saxes, A/B&#39;ing with bright vs dark mouthpieces.  And a number of listeners.  The question was simply, do you prefer the first tone, or the second tone?  Which sounds better to you?
   
  In every single case, for every listener, they preferred the "brighter" setup.
   
  So much for that "dark tone".

 I know what you mean, I compare it just to show how different material with same design can change the sound, but asking  why in a small space as a mpc  don&#39;t affect and in a big  yes.
 
 I&#39;m not a clarinet player... but I can reconize a plastic instrument from one in wood, even together with an ensamble!!!
 
My only opinion is that any materials change the sound even if so small, maybe the matter is that the ears can reconize until some frequency than lost perception, more or less as a microphone.

 In a sax, it is the column of air that is vibrating as a standing wave with
 the help of the reed to sustain this vibration.  Soft pads can dampen this
 sound by absorbing a significant amount of the accoustic energy.
 
 Also, I think you were asking about frequency spectrums for different
 materials?  This comparison is included for the paper on plastic vs metal
 Dukoffs.  There is a link to it on the MP Work site.

I did sound clips a while back on cane vs Fibracell reeds.  Out of the 5
people who participated, they picked the correct reed 53% of the time.  So
get your flippin&#39; coins out again.

The sound clips are still in the Files - Tenor section of the MPWork site. 
The results are in the Database section.  We could do something similar
with your clarinet material test.

would know the truth about how a mouthpiece vibrates, responds, and sounds 
compared to fine rubber.

Sometimes using extremes to make a point works.

My opinion is that materials do make a difference if the design remains the 
same.

And by the way the Ridenour clarinets are made out of rubber which is a 
natural material like wood and not a man made material like plastic. I think if one 
searches the Internet they would find an article from Tom Ridenour on the 
subject. I even think the rubber might be superior to wood. Even though I play a 
wood clarinet much of the time I always have the Tom&#39;s rubber clarinet in the 
Broadway Show pits.

This is why I cited RIAs and Dukoffs.  They do make the same designs in
metal and non-metal.

Drake makes a ceramic mouthpiece.   Close to concrete.

            <pre class='message__body'>First of all, the "rubber" that is used to make clarinets is not found in nature. It&#39;s a vulcanized formulation of various natural materials. You may be interested to know that Alan Fox (Fox bassoons, oboes, eng. horns, sail boats, etc.) once told me (many years ago) that he believed the polymer polypropolene to be superior for bassoon manufacture in nearly every aspect to maple (wood in general). I believe he still feels this way.  In addition, many pro-level oboe manufacturers (Loree, Fox,  for example) offer the option of having the upper section of their professional lines manufactured out of polymers. And, if you can satisfy oboeists, I&#39;ll bet you can satisfy anyone. - Lars</pre>

Can you explain what you base this opinion on? For example, 
scientific evidence for it, or blindfold tests where only the 
material was changed.

Have you ever played a few instruments with only different materials 
and same design (although even if you have it would not prove 
anything because of psychology/subjectivity)?

The blindfold test on flutes mentioned (which I knew before) is one 
of the most reliable that I have seen, and I think it shows the 
difference is too small to hear. I&#39;m actually surprised the 
difference between those flutes was not bigger, just because usually
different instruments are different, even same model. I&#39;m impressed 
with Muramatsu for being able to do this!

I&#39;m willing to bet that if they made 10 takes of one player playing 
all the flutes, and 10 takes of the same player playing one of the 
flutes, people on average would not be able to tell the difference. 
Notice especially how the silver flute was preferred overall more 
than all the gold flutes, while flutists usually automatically 
think gold is better (I know a professional who ordered a gold 
mouthpiece without even trying it assuming it will better than his 
silver mouthpiece just because it is gold!).
