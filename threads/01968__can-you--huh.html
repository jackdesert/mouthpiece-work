            <pre class='message__body'>dear keith or fellows, i have an berg larsen-like tenor mpc that 
blows nice at around .100  it seems to have a roll over S-type 
baffle and a medium chamber. depending on the reed it can be bright 
or dark. now, can a berg-like bullet chamber be added to it. will 
that take some edge off? does the length of the bullet make a 
difference also? thanks.

If the baffle is high, a bullet can be cut into it.  If it is low, 
one could be added with epoxy putty.

If the baffle is high, cutting a bullet will add some roundness and 
fatness to the low notes, but they will project a little less.  I 
think it will have less edge than a step baffle.  The longer the 
bullet, the more you extend the roundness/less projection into the 
midrange.

The Runyon Jaguar is an interesting compromise.  It has a narrow 
bullet look.  It is actually a groove cut at an angle so it makes a 
bullet-like parabolic shape where it meets the straight baffle.  But 
it is only along the middle 1/3rd of the baffle.  I have only a bari 
Jag.  The sound is complex and likeable.  But I still prefer my 
Quantum for the additional projection it has.

I don&#39;t use this piece and would sell it if you were interested...

            <pre class='message__body'>My Berg bullets seem to have been routed out from behind--back through the throat. You would need some kind of extension on a Dremel to do this correctly, otherwise you are going to come in from an angle through the window and tend to cut up into the chamber. My take is that the bullets add roundness to the sound without taking the edge off, especially emphasizing the low mids. If you want to take edge off without altering the tonal balance overall probably the best thing to do is to lower the baffle just behind the tip rail. This IME smooths the sound out without adversely affecting projection too much, and can also make the mpc better behaved.

            <pre class='message__body'>There are some photos of the flex shaft rig I have been using in the 
Photos - Chamber Work area.  Its not fancy, but I&#39;m not going to 
upgrade it until it breaks.  I have acquired some carbide cutters and 
have a few grinding points for SS work.

The flex shaft is small enough diameter to go up the bore of a 
mouthpiece.  One of the photos shows this.
