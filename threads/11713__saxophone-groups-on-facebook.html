            <pre class='message__body'>We have just added a new discussion group, SAXOPHONE NATION, to Facebook. This group is for general saxophone discussion, and we provide it in the hope that we can all learn from one another. Like all our other Facebook groups, this group is moderated, and English is the only allowed language. All saxophonists are welcome.

We also provide the following "specialty" discussion groups on Facebook. Many of them have thousands of members. These groups are:

SAXOPHONES AND SAXOPHONE EQUIPMENT FOR SALE
SAXOPHONE MOUTHPIECES
SAXOPHONE REPAIR
VINTAGE AND COLLECTOR SAXOPHONES
BASS SAXOPHONES
SAXOPHONE TEACHERS
PROFESSIONAL SAXOPHONE PLAYERS
MUSICIAN HUMOR

If you are a member of Facebook, we invite you to join and participate</pre>
