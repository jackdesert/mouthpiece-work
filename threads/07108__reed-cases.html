            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

I&#39;ve got between 50 and 100 reed cases, all in sizes that will fit bari sax reeds down to clarinet reeds (3 sizes in all).  They all will fit roughly 12 reeds(clarinet) down to 8 reeds (bari).  I designed them similarly to the Selmer reed cases, but with locking hinges instead of clasps.  I outsourced the construction and was not so happy with the final product.  Some of them work great, but some of them tend to bind and some of the glue on the fabric and glass inside doesn&#39;t hold so well.  If one were so inclined, they could fairly easily reglue the fabric and glass on these and they could reset the locking hinges on the ones that bind to make great reed cases.  I have used the ones personally that work well for a couple of years now and am happy with them, but don&#39;t have the time to go through them all and repair them for resale.  If anyone would like them all, I&#39;ll let them go for $50 plus actual shipping cost.  

Cheers,
Ben
