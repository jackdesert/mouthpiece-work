            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry for the newbie question -- I haven&#39;t, as of yet, done any mouthpiece
work... I&#39;ve basically been trying to glean as much information from this
fantastic group before I start getting involved in such work...
 
However, one question:
 
If was to purchase a mouthpiece with a .067" tip opening (such as the one
listed on eBay) - How far (within reason) will I be able to open it up
before suffering any dire consequences?
 
Would I be able to open it up to .130"? Or, is that asking too much?
 
Thanks in advance for tolerating me... :-)
 
Sincerely,

it would be really difficult to open it that much.  It would distort the
shape of the mouthpiece a lot.  You would need to do a combination of tip
cutting and angling the table.  With a lot of tip cutting, the tip will get
razor sharp and you will need to file it blunt again.  This shortens the
mouthpiece.  With table angling, the ligature will get loose.  

You might get .020-.030" with tip cutting, and .010-.020 with angling the
table.  You will need to reshape the side and tip rails and the baffle. 
The plating will be toast.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I have cut through to the bite plate a couple of times. While you probably
want to avoid it, there doesn't seem to be a problem with playability. The
baffle surface is still smooth.  
  
When I started doing this, I tried all sorts of stuff on mouthpieces, and I
still do some "major restructuring" projects, but it generally works best to
optimize a given mouthpiece rather than try to turn it into something else.
Opening a tip that much is inadvisable, for all the reasons already mentioned
- you'll change so many other dimensions of the piece (rail thickness, table
width, chamber volume, baffle height, tip thickness, length...) in doing so
that you'll have a ton of "remedial" work to do. Unless you're up for that,
I'd start with a larger-tip mouthpiece or just open this one a modest amount
(.085?)

the alto piece yet...other than it is unique. The tenor plays
fantastic!  A great copy. A very nice playing copy. A very inexpensive
copy! BTW, the ebay ad says 0.067" for the tip, I measured 0.078".

Thanks for the tip, Steve!
