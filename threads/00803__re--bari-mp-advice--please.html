            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Fellas - I&#39;m more a "big" clarinet player any more, Selmer 33 Bass, 
loverly!, but did play alto/bari jazz on back [and now lurk/learn here!]. My 
good buddy, great on tenor, wants me to work up his King Super 20 bari, 
#502xxx for me to play it on some Belloto-Hickey 4 horn charts, quite a 
challenge for an 80+&#39;er.  I have a choice of 3 mps, my OLD Martin [biggie] , 
not VG, my Meyer 6 [too much], and the ?orig? King 4, best so far, as it can 
be soft down low , good pad seating I guess.  I will appreciate any 
comments/help/suggestions from you experienced/pro saxers. TKS, Don Berger
