            <pre class='message__body'>Realize that it is not enough to simply have a reed that conveniently vibrates in sync with the pressure fluctuations of the air column to produce a great sound. Any dead cane reed or piece of plastic will do that to some degree.  What makes a good reed good, is it having a strong resonance itself (squeak energy) which lies within a certain frequency range, the exact frequency of which is easily controlled by the player, tuning it independently of the pitch of the fingered fundamental to reinforce some harmonic of the tone.  

Additionally, the reed does not vibrate in a neat, open/closed manner.  It must vibrate differently accross the width of the reed tip in order to reproduce the air column resonances - one part of the tip could be closed for the fundamental while another part could be wide open for the first harmonic, another part almost closed for the second, and another half open for the third, for example.  Add to that the variable reed resonance, and you have some pretty complex motion going on.

One wouldn&#39;t expect the reed taper to be linear, since the degree of drop from the table plane to progressive points along the radial facing curve is not linear.  Nor would the reed fiber response to tortion necesarily be linear.</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not think your description of vibration of a reed across the tip 
(where part of the tip is open and another closed) is correct, and would 
like to see your source on this.

Even playing a note while tipping the mouthpiece from side to side (as 
in the reed balancing maneuver) doesn&#39;t change the tone much, just the 
resistance.

To attain a certain tonal quality, it seems sufficient that the 
open-closed movement of the reed characterizes a wave form (which to my 
recollection has some characteristics of a square wave) - which is of 
course composed of a sum of various harmonics.

            <pre class='message__body'>I suggest you measure the thickness of your reeds at 1-2 mm from the 
tip. Reeds have a uniform thickness at the tip, and this seems to be a 
desirable quality.

Lack of uniformity at the tip apparently causes undesirable instability 
in the reed output. This is why a too-narrow or uneven tip rail may 
squeak; and it&#39;s why, as Tom Ridenour points out, reeds are sometimes 
not improved by clipping because it introduces minor asymmetries at the 
tip. It&#39;s also why he advocates finishing the tip on a new reed even 
before testing it, with strokes of his tool towards the tip of the reed 
- a method which clearly will generate an even tip thickness.

At the base of the vamp, there is obvious convex curvature across the 
width, which extends forward and decreases, and ends at the tip. To a 
certain extent, this curvature contributes to the voicing of the reed. 
In particular, I find that increasing this curvature somewhat by 
removing material can darken a reed somewhat, without making it harder 
to blow. This is sometimes an alternative adjustment to clipping the tip 
of a reed that&#39;s too buzzy.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have over 40 years experience of making my own reeds and mouthpieces and
Tom was my student in the mid 70&#39;s. 

I have always thinned the edges of reed tips to warm up the sound but I
mostly play classical clarinet. 

For Jazz, the stronger sides of a reed give the brightness that many jazz
players prefer. 

On all my mouthpieces, most of my reeds work best with a 0.007" (0.18mm)
thickness at the tip and 0.005" (0.14mm) just inside the side of the tip
edge. 

It seems to make sense that the curve down the center of the reed should be
matched along the sides of the reeds but reduced in size, and that is what
works best for me.

I suggest you measure the thickness of your reeds at 1-2 mm from the 
tip. Reeds have a uniform thickness at the tip, and this seems to be a 
desirable quality.

The link offered showed many vibrational modes of a reed excited without 
any embouchure at all. That is an incomplete representation of the 
playing situation.

Surprisingly to me, both linear AND torsional modes of reed vibration 
are strongly present under conditions of embouchure (see abstract 
below). http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR05/Event/28310
I&#39;ll assume that the "artificial embouchure" was some reasonable 
facsimile, absent further information.

Whether asymmetric vibrational modes are present, and to what extent, 
under ordinary playing conditions, isn&#39;t clear however, and I haven&#39;t 
found any source to substantiate this assertion.
