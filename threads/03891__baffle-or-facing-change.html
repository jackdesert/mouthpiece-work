            <pre class='message__body'>I am not the most experienced refacer on this newsgroup (by a longshot), 
but I have found that if the piece plays well (i.e., easily and 
comfortably), the facing is probably OK for you.  I&#39;d measure it anyway, 
though.  Thin sound, to me, often means lack of resonance.  Are the side 
rails even?  How does the tip rail look (under magnification)?  
Sometimes if the tip rail is uneven or doesn&#39;t have a well-defined 
boundary between it and the chamber, or doesn&#39;t have clean corners, that 
seems to cause it.  If the baffle is too high, that could cause thinness 
as well, but remove baffle material slowly and play-test often.  If it 
had a long, straight-ish baffle, I&#39;d try removing material from the 
interior end of the baffle, but since it&#39;s a Meyer copy, this is 
probably not the case.  Hope this helps.

            <pre class='message__body'>What I have found is that taking the baffle down directly behind the tip rail will definitely smooth the sound--rounding it a bit if it is very edgy, but not changing the main body of the tone much. If you want to keep a very bright edge while making the sound fatter then lower the baffle a bit farther back. In any case things have to be kept in balance. A very high baffle and a big chamber is not a good combination, nor is a low baffle with a small chamber, at least in my experience.

            <pre class='message__body'>sorry, i don&#39;t know. I have no expertise about the
design of mouthpieces. I read a book about saxophones
over Christmas, "The Devil&#39;s Horn" by Michael Segell.
It sounded like the many pro players he interviewed
were always looking for another, different, better
mouthpiece. And every sax has a different sound and
every player has a different sound. AND we have to
match all three to get the sound we want, which will
eventually cost me beau coup dollars. So the advice in
th e book was to find a good teacher, practice, and
eventually maybe you can alter the sound. Sorry for
the long reply, I needed to remind myself of this same
advice. Good Luck

Usually "tubby" is used by players who do not like a piece.  Those who 
like this sound call it dark, spread, sultry, full of body.

Like the others I would lower the roll-over area a little at first and 
play test it.  With Meyers there is usually not a huge roll-over.  If 
you are looking for rounder sounding lower notes, lower the baffle in 
the middle and back.  You may need to go 1/16" to make a differnce.  
You can also consider scooping out the sidewalls more but this can be a 
lot more work.  It would be better to try out a HR Link.

Yeah, maybe tubby is the wrong word for it.  What I want is the
noticeably fatter, rounder sound that the other good Meyer copies (and
 current Meyers) that I&#39;ve tried lately have, but retain the
liveliness and projection and altissimo response that the piece
currently has.  I&#39;ll try lowering the baffle first and see how that
works. Thanks.

If you take too much off the mouthpiece will have resistance and a dull tone.  It
will lose its quick response.  If you hog out the throat a la Link, Caravan, Rascher,
intonation will suffer, and the tone will not have a good center.  In just the last
month I have filled in the hollowed out side walls of three Links, adding more baffle,
improving these mouthpieces for the players.  Paul

            <pre class='message__body'>If you are happy with the way the piece responds I wouldn&#39;t lower the baffle just behind the tip. I&#39;d start about 1/2 way back and lower from there.

            <pre class='message__body'>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t consider making any major changes to any mouthpiece as I feel that the designer of the piece either did a good job or didn&#39;t.  Far be it from me to waste my time correcting any "flaws" when there are a host of other designs that generally could work well for what a player wants.

In this case, I would lower the total baffle by about 1/16" of an inch and if that didn&#39;t result in the tone changing towards what I had in mind I would either stop and go buy something else or I would shorten the baffle length.  Again, if that didn&#39;t result in the piece moving towards the tone that I wanted then I would stop and buy something else.  It sounds like you would prefer something more link like.
