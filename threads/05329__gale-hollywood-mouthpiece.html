Jerry Mulligan&#39;s estate and equipment was auctioned off on ebay several 
years ago.  The Gale mouthpiece with the 3 dots around the barrel is 
HARD RUBBER not wooden. These mouthpieces are extremely rare. You 
should continue to watch ebay or post a want it now ad. 

The Gregory mouthpiece company evolved to Gale which has been defunct 
for many years now, but Charles Bay took over the designs and still 
currently markets them. It would be much easier to purchase currently 
produced Charles Bay Baritone sax mouthpiece which it a fine quality 
item.

is so sub-catagorized it&#39;s like a maze.  And the posts in the catagory this 
would fit in were at least a year old if not older.

I&#39;ve got a student wanting to step up from a rental Yamaha YAS-23.  But not 
ready for a Selmer S80 or high end Yamaha or Yani.  I&#39;d like her to get 
something with a Selmer-style mechanism, but my knowledge of saxophone 
models is limited to clunker student instruments or high end pro models.

They haven&#39;t gotten back to me with a budget but I was going to recommend 
they go with either a low-end step-up and use it for marching band in high 
school when they could get her a Selmer or something.  Or get something 
mid-range and then in high school sell it and use some of the money for a 
marching clunker and the rest towards a nice instrument.  Or for all I know, 
maybe they want to jump right to a S80 now.

Anyway, I would appreciate any recommendations for student/intermediate 
saxes with Selmer-style mechanism that are reliable and good intonation.

Off-list replies are fine since it&#39;s a little OT.


Many Thanks,

I would recommend a Jupiter artist series.  Or many times I&#39;ve seen
Yamaha 61/62&#39;s used reasonably priced.  Might be the logical choice if
they want to stick with Yamaha...or an old Yanagisawa.

I&#39;ve got a student wanting to step up from a rental Yamaha YAS-23. But not 
ready for a Selmer S80 or high end Yamaha or Yani. I&#39;d like her to get 
something with a Selmer-style mechanism, but my knowledge of saxophone 
models is limited to clunker student instruments or high end pro models.

They haven&#39;t gotten back to me with a budget but I was going to recommend 
they go with either a low-end step-up and use it for marching band in high 
school when they could get her a Selmer or something. Or get something 
mid-range and then in high school sell it and use some of the money for a 
marching clunker and the rest towards a nice instrument. Or for all I know, 
maybe they want to jump right to a S80 now.

Anyway, I would appreciate any recommendations for student/intermediate 
saxes with Selmer-style mechanism that are reliable and good intonation.

Off-list replies are fine since it&#39;s a little OT.

Many Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>My main alto is an Antigua Winds Prestige.  This model is silver plated with gold lacquered keys.
   
  There is an identical Antigua model, the Supreme, which is all lacquer.
   
  Intonation is very good throughout.  Unlike many altos (and I don&#39;t know why alto is worse than tenor in this respect) which have upper registers as much as 15 cents sharp in relation to the lower register, these Antiguas are more in the 3-5 cent range.  Also, middle D is very good, and low D is not flat, unlike many other altos.
   
  This instrument is VERY similar to the Selmer Series II.  I had a fellow in my shop with a silver Series II alto he had just purchased.  It played badly (which is why he got it cheap), but needed only a few pads reseated and regulation.  Once regulated it was excellent.  He played both his Selmer Series II and my Antigua Prestige, and commented that they felt the same, and played the same.  "I&#39;m going to buy one of these (referring to my Antigua) as a backup because it plays just like this Selmer."
   
  Also, Antigua Winds is right there in San Antonio.  They maintain an excellent parts inventory, I have seen it myself.  And their parts book is second to none.
   
  I think list price on the Prestige (silver) is about $2300, The Supreme (lacquer) is about $2000.  Either of these would play for your customer well into college, and even when a "professional" grade sax is purchased, the Antigua will still make a great backup horn.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Winston soprano, too.  I just could not justify big bucks for one, but for under $500 it was worthwhile.  I think it plays every bit as in-tune as any Selmer of Yamaha I have ever played.  It was more than worth the money.  In my experience as a player and employee/repairman in a retail music store, I find the Taiwanese horns to be of much higher quality than the current Elkhart product (to the UAW&#39;s great shame).  Mainland China is still to be avoided, but that may not be true for much longer.
