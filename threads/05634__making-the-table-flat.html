            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
I have not posted much here, but I have been doing mouthpiece work for 
a few years and I have a question about making the table flat- HOW?
I know all about the glass and the fine sand paper and all that, but as 
we know, this can cause (if not done carefully) a convex table.
Is there any mathod better than the glass/sandpaper?  Is there any tool 
(other than the large ones used in factories) that can easily and 
consistantly make the table flat?
I can&#39;t imagine that glass and sandpaper is as good as it can get.
Thanks all,
Sky

I think this is the state of the art for the flattest tables at a
reasonable cost.  I have never seen a machine made table that is flatter
than a hand flattened table.  Even the lightest sandpaper strokes on a
machined table will find a bunch of (small) high spots on the table.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Keith,
This will be a very interesting discussion. I personnaly believe 
that there will be nothing as flat as a properly machined surface. 
What ever the experience in the good old handwork the refacer has, 
there are to many factors that are not stable or always the same 
with the "hand" methode. Nevertheless, I know from my own experience 
that very good results can be achieved by hand. Still, nothing will 
beat machining, in my opinion

I also think that most people can not make a table flatter than a machine
could.  But a good refacer can.

Yes, I suppose that cost is the problem in that equation.  If it is
worth anything to anyone, I have sometimes used a really wide bastard
file on the table.  It has pros and cons- pro is that it is flat; con
is that it is not even close to being a fine grain.
I was thinking about grinding wheels and the more I think of it, the
closer I get to a big expensive machine.

            <pre class='message__body'>It all depends on what level we are talking about. I mean

            <pre class='message__body'>It boils down to having and/or developing hand/eye coordination, a 
sensitivity to manipulating materials.  I had no prior experience with 
mouthpieces, but MUCH experience with guitar repair and woodworking 
within that context.  It took me a couple tries to get a table flat but 
I could quickly see the ins and outs and what it would, and eventually 
did, take to do the job.  Never a problem after that.  In my experience 
people either have this kind of aptitude and set of skills or they 
don&#39;t.  And anyone who isn&#39;t able to get a table flat might as well 
forget about putting a good curve on a mouthpiece, as that takes a LOT 
more handwork skill.

            <pre class='message__body'>Don&#39;t underestimate a person&#39;s ability to make high-precision surfaces
using freehand methods. It&#39;s not particularly difficult for even a
novice to grind a telescope mirror (parabolic) or diagonal mirror
(flat) to a tolerance well under 1/4 the wavelength of visible light.
Thats a tolerance of about 200 millimicrons or about 0.01 thousandths
of an inch. Experienced grinders can do even better than that. The
"trick" is using the correct motions and materials, and having lots of
patience. There are many telescope-grinding books describing how to
produce specific surfaces (e.g. flat). - Brent -

            <pre class='message__body'>Some mouthpieces are totally machine made and have very good tolerances. I
won&#39;t "talk out of school" and name one maker I know of pricey pieces, but
I&#39;ve been to their shop and seen and played stuff untouched by human hands
that was damn near perfect. The were using some very sophisticated
equipment, much better than you usually see in mouthpiece manufacturing. It
can be done....the cost of admission is pretty high
