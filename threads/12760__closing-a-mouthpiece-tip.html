            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

      I've been trying to close the the tip on a Bari sax mouthpiece. When I start to close the tip (as well as shorten the facing curve), I ended up making the facing curve exceedingly long. Is there any way to remedy this? Thank you!!!</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>Your table is probably convex.  Hold a straight edge on it to see if it rocks.

It takes practice to flatten a table without making it convex.  I have some videos on YouTube showing how to do this.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Mouthpiece should be sitting flat on the abrasive paper , not inclined at all when pulling back. Just alter where the pressure is exerted . 1st finger is moved forward.  </pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>Get better at it. The position and vector of the force you use to push the mouthpiece is very important (i.e., how you hold it, how much downforce applied where, which direction you draw it). You need to develop a feel for where it's right, there is no other way. I ruined my first maybe 10-20 mouthpieces figuring this out, there are no shortcuts. I recommend figuring it out on mouthpieces you don't care if you scrap before working on anything you're sure you want to keep.</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>Thank you all for your input and recommendations!! It seems that I was making the table convex by applying more pressure on certain areas of the mouthpiece which made the table uneven. 

Man vs uneven table: take two!!!

            <pre class='message__body'>It is very difficult to close a tip using this method.  

Draw an exaggerated diagram using a straight edge and something round, a can, for example.

Next, using the straight edge again, draw a new table that is the same at the butt end as the 
original table, but is angled upwards a little, to reflect the amount you want to close the tip.  
This does not have to be "to scale" or accurate.  

Now, draw a curve from this new table to original tip.  

So, tell me, how will you make that curve smooth and have enough material in the middle of 
the facing curve, and back toward the break?

You can't.  It is not possible.

            <pre class='message__body'>Duh!  Please ignore my previous post.  It's late, I'm tired.

I was thinking of shortening facings, not reducing tip opening. 

Yes, you can reduce tip opening with this method.  The difficult thing is 
getting a flat facing back.
