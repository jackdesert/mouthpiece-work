            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, I&#39;ve been playing "plastic" reed for 30 years on Bari and love the fact that once you get one you like your set for a lot longer than a cane reed.    I play one or two times a week and practice at home occasionally and I get one or two years out of a reed.  I have changed brands only once in 30 years but have tried many.  Like anything else you have to find what works for you. I swear there is not total consistancy in the all the brands as I always have a hard time breaking in a new one.  Maybe it&#39;s just me adapting to the reed as it ages and a new one just takes getting use to. ONce I"ve got one I  like, I&#39;m set for quiet a while.

Anyway, I&#39;ll be sure to give your reeds a try when you come out with them.  So you can count on one sold! LOL!
