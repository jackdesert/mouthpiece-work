            <pre class='message__body'>This is the baffle insert we have been developing. It is made from brass, and is "make and model specific" in that we don&#39;t believe in "one size fits all", and will make about a half dozen different models for popular mouthpieces, as well as custom versions for any mouthpiece. The prototype is shown here alongside a Saxgourmet Blues Blaster blank to give you some size perspective. As you can see, it&#39;s really rather simple (although figuring out what we consider to be the optimum size and shape was a bit tedious and time consuming), and is held inside the mouthpiece via friction. The idea is to take an existing mouthpiece, and allow the owner to make it brighter and louder at a modest cost, and to enable the owner to make this change at will. Trust me, it works VERY well. It really does make possible the concept of having "two mouthpieces in one". I&#39;m ready to manufacture this product now. No, it&#39;s not on the website yet, and no, we don&#39;t have any for sale yet…..

Here&#39;s where I need your advice: what is a reasonable retail selling price?  There is no point in making these unless it is a profitable item for our company. Your thoughts would be MUCH appreciated!

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Look at the price of the Runyon Spoilers for a similar product modification.
Then look at the price of the new mouthpiece you would be helping the customer
avoid buying. (Let's not even go there with the oval stick on ones.) Since it
is brass, not plastic and it is custom fit, I'd say pricing should be about
partway between the price points of 1/2 of a new mouthpiece and the less
expensive plastic inserts. Does that still give you a range to make it
profitable and sellable? \\--- In MouthpieceWork@yahoogroups.com,  wrote:

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Paul C., Is Guru Steve right about the spoilers not being made anymore???? If
so, I need a jewelry box for mine and a magnet or clip on the back to keep it
handy during gigs and safe in the case! The "double your mouthpiece sound for
about the same price as one" has always been a great selling point, and that's
on top of the reasonable prices for good mouthpieces! Sorry Selmer, but your
suggested retail price is beyond scary for a S180 right now. Remember rubber
does grow on trees. Well, at least some of the ingredients do. Guru Steve, as
yours would be custom made, custom fit for a variety of mouthpieces, and it
would not have a dragon tongue :)~~~~ yes it would be a different product. But
you were asking about price point. And that's the only comparable product I
can think of. Again, the stick on oval ones do not count. Make sure you
present it in your classy style. A nice, safe case will help someone avoid
feeling buyers remorse when they have to play a mellow gig like concert band
or a musical. Then it will not be lost in the case lining for the weekend gigs
that pay better - when you get to play Mustang Sally again and beer drinking
songs all night. E v e r e t t F. \\--- In mouthpiecework@yahoogroups.com,
