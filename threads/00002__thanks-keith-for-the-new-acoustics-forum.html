"I agree that things should be as good as they can be, no question. The problem as I see it (and I could be wrong) is that there are big factors, such as the impedance of the reed  (controlled by the embouchure) which affect these parameters that we are trying to measure so meticulously."

It is essential to realize that these adjustments (at least as far as my application of them is concerned) are for advanced players only with acoustically superior instruments, and for each individual player and instrument exclusively.  An advanced player knows his embouchure, his horn, and his setup.  He knows how to make his reeds as consistent as possible.  He knows exactly where his "center of gravity" is on his instrument.  From that point, it is entirely possible to get very accurate measurements of the original setup and to compare them to the theoretically optimal for that player/horn/mouthpiece combination, and make some comparison trials.  

"You will notice that Benade does not say to try to calculate the internal volume or

Frs to the nth degree."

He also never described how to design or adjust a mouthpiece facing to the .00X" tolerance, but here you see a bunch of guys talking about it and doing it. 

He did say that saxophone players should be as concerned as oboists regarding cavity volume and frs, so you have to take that as meaning a lot more can be done than we are currently doing.   The fact is, all his examples use the oboe, and it&#39;s just not that easy to measure the effective cavity of an oboe since it is the way the reed vibrates that determines it.  He does get pretty specific and Hertzy, when describing how to align the modes of a certain note, in order for it to respond, tune, and sound better.  

When you see how shifting f2 or f3 of low B, just a few cents, on the alto, can make the difference between a low B that cracks and one that doesn&#39;t, then you&#39;ll appreciate why one would be concerned about a 34 cent discrepancy between the measured and the actual mouthpiece + neck frs.  The 3rd tenor player in the High School band, using a Yamaha 62 tenor, won&#39;t notice it, but an advanced player on a great horn will.

In order to understand and appreciate this stuff completely, you have to be an advanced player and you must have at least once, played on an acoustically great vintage horn with a great setup. If you aren&#39;t and you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s like talking about being a great cook, when you have never eaten anything other than fast food.

            <pre class='message__body'>"Why does it have to be an "acoustically great vintage horn"? "

Because the more optimally aligned the resonances of a saxophone are to start with, the more noticeable the effect of small acoustical corrections become.  A bad horn may be playable if you damp a good % of the resonances (no resonators).  A so-so horn may become good by making alignment adjustments, but it will won&#39;t become better than that.  A good horn may become very good, but never great.  An advanced player will notice that there is always something about all these horns that holds him back as an artist.

A great horn seems to have no limits and becomes what the player wants.  It challenges the player to do more, rather than hold him back.

Saxophones are no different than violins in this respect.

As far a vintage is concerned - IMO, modern horns are to varying degrees acoustically hobbled in that their design sacrifices tonal richness, depth, and responsiveness for easy playability and even tempered tuning.   Something has to be compromised.  If we make the horns easy to blow and easy to tune, we sacrifice some sound but more of the masses will 
be able to play them good enough to enjoy it without too much pain, but an advanced player will quickly discover the tonal limits that he can&#39;t go beyond, on such a horn.

extremely fond of Leblancs, Buffet S-1&#39;s, and Conn 30M&#39;s, for example.
However, the market votes with its checkbook, and the VAST majority of

"playing what they are used to and what they have", but when it comes down
to writing a check, the overwhelming majority of buyers buy new horns.

 

The vintage market has far more talk than sales, in my experience.

I have heard some sax dealers claim that vintage saxes sound better (tonal
richness, depth, etc) because they are not acoustically great. Their tones
holes are not spaced by a computer designed jig so they have more
"character".

I use a vintage Conn sop and tenor and a Yamaha alto and bari. So I am not
firmly in either camp.

Whoah!  "Highly pimped out" doesn&#39;t begin to describe the looks of this horn.  I can think of some less-evolved gig situations I&#39;ve been in where just walking in the door with something that looks that sharp would ensure one&#39;s success, and let&#39;s face it, some gigs have more in common with WWF wrestling than the Village Vanguard (and we can learn to love each one in its own way, right?).   Where I&#39;m talking about nobody was gonna hear a note you were going to play anyway, but with a horn like that you could still contribute on the visual level...
That being said, in case the soundman did turn up your mic and the guitar players turned down, how does it play?  And just how much difference IS there between the later 10m&#39;s and the earlier ones?  Are the acoustics "improved" in the newer ones?  If so, is that a good thing or not?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have played several Mark VI altos, 3 SBA altos, and about a dozen Mark VI tenors in my career.  Of those:

* 2 tenors, belonging to other players, were great horns
* about 1/2 the others, one of which I own, are very good
* one of the Mark VI altos was great, or very very good (it&#39;s not mine)
* one of the SBA altos was great; I own this one

I have also played several Yanagisawa saxophones at a couple of shows (Mel Martin, who endorses these horns, is a good friend of mine so he helped guide me to the good ones.)  One of the sopranos I tried was great or very good, the others merely good.  One of the tenors I tried was great or very good, rivaling the great Mark VIs I have tried.  This one had an aftermarket Yanagisawa solid silver neck.

I therefore doubt the validity of the statement that vintage horns are innately superior.  A great horn is a great horn, and great examples can be found, with about the same degree of regularity, in both vintage and modern instruments.

BTW, when I say "great" I mean a horn that:

* has even response
* is in tune
* most important, has a "singing" tone

I think the first two qualifications are a result of good design, manufacturing and set up; the last is more intangible.  The fact that the "great" modern horn had an aftermarket neck leads me to believe that the acoustic balance of a horn is greatly influenced by this piece of the saxophone, and attention paid here will give good results with any decent instrument.  There are many examples of famous artists who use alternate necks, and I personally know many saxophonists who do the same (Mel among them).  

Additionally, there are countless working pros who use "modern" instruments; if they were sonically inferior, this would not be the case.

OK here I am :)

In essence I agree. But the fact that the effective volume is to a significant extent dynamically determined means that static measurements are of limited value. Further, there are reed parameters that have influence but which cannot be measured accurately. You might remember that Nederveen talks about the fact that double reeds do not have an internal volume anywhere near that of the missing cone, but that the oboe,for example, still manages to play in tune due to compensating effect of the reeds themselves. 

Changing that small double-reed volume does affect the modes, but a simple measure of internal volume would be misleading. Sax reeds likewise lower all the impedances in ways that are not direcly predictable formulaicly. You can&#39;t just plug in a fixed reed constant.

The point is not that we shouldn&#39;t try to measure the parameters that we can and try to correlate the results with observed behavior, but trying to create a formula to accurately predict acoustic behavior from a limits number of relevant parameters is tantamount to chasing a chimera.

I&#39;m arriving at the airport. More later.

I am not sure I understand exactly what you mean by the above statement.
Can you elaborate?

Lance have you tried to measure the "effective volume"
&lt;http://jbtsaxmusic.homestead.com/Mouthpiece_effective_volume_study_new.&#92;
pdf>   of any of your mouthpiece and reed set-ups as done in the linked
study yet?  It is really quite easy to do.  From these effective volume
trials it is my observation and conclusion that the effect of the 
impedance of the reed  upon the frequency of the played pitch is already
accounted for and incorporated into the sounding pitch.  Of course the
player needs to play using the same embouchure pressure and dynamic
level each time to get a consistent result.

I didn&#39;t post that.  Toby did.  It&#39;s funny.  Toby never wants to acknowledge that one can improve a saxophone&#39;s performance by making little effective changes to the bore, though Benade demonstrated it many times in his publications using the oboe, bassoon, clarinet, and flute.  The prerequisite is that you have a complete understanding of the instruments acoustical profile - basically what each resonance for each note is doing.  This is not impossible.

If we take Toby&#39;s view seriously, then it is senseless to try to do anything.  All saxophones are the same.  Non can be made better via a systematic analysis and treatment.  The fact is, no two horns are the same.  Some are terrible, and some are great, and the difference is a bunch of little factors.  I agree that it often makes little sense to concern oneself with attempting to align some instruments, but those that are already exceptional, stand to improve considerably.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,

I&#39;m back after four days in the wilds of South China. Trying to catch up here...

Both of those are my statements. What I mean in both is that a small change in embouchure tension can result in a huge change in pitch in many notes while playing. I can vary the second register notes +- 30 cents easily with minor changes in my embouchure. In fact, when testing variations in mpc
 volume I found it almost impossible NOT to compensate, so I really have no way of really knowing what the added or subtracted volume did to the register relationships. 

The fly in the ointment here is the fact that "normal embouchure" is nothing of the sort: it is not set in stone. The fact that the embouchure tension to a significant extent determines the pitch of the played note both allows us to "sing" with the horn and to add vibrato. It is one of the
 characteristics that makes the sax a very expressive instrument.

Given that, HTH can you pretend to accurately measure volume and Frs, and even if you could, how relevant are those numbers given that the player can vary them significantly with the twitch of the chin?

Lance have you tried to measure the "effective volume"  of any of your mouthpiece and reed set-ups as done in the linked study yet?  It is really quite easy to do.  From these effective volume trials it is my observation and conclusion that the effect of the  impedance of the reed  upon the
 frequency of the played pitch is already accounted for and incorporated into the sounding pitch.  Of course the player needs to play using the same embouchure pressure and dynamic level each time to get a consistent result.

            <pre class='message__body'>You make some good points Toby.  First, let me point out to you that
musicians are making very precise and consistent embouchure settings
every time they tune their instrument.  They blow with their "centered"
embouchure and airstream which incorporates muscle memory developed from
thousands of hours of playing and compare that to the fixed pitch of the
tuner.  If they match isn&#39;t perfect, then move their tuning device,
sometimes a very minor amount to adjust the length of the instrument to
the temperature of the room or hall at that time.

If the musician did not have this embouchure sensitivity, he could not
accurately tune the instrument to begin with.  Of course even the best
musician would be hard pressed to pick up the instrument and in 20
trials produce right from the start, the exact same frequency down the
the last hertz.  This is why I believe the artificial embouchure device
(if it works) will be a useful tool in these studies.

It is true that absolute accuracy is not possible in either calculating
the length and volume of the missing cone or calculating the natural
resonant frequency  of the length of the neck + the missing cone + end
correction.  However, if a good approximation of those values can be
determined, then comparing that calculated frequency to the actual
played frequency of the mouthpiece plus neck can give a good idea of
whether or not the mouthpiece in that position on the cork is acting as
an effective substitution for the missing cone.

It is my understanding that when the mouthpiece  is in the position on
the neck to have its effective volume match that of the missing cone,
then

-the instrument tunes to AD0
-the long tube low B and Bb along with their 2nd partials are in tune
-the low F and middle F octaves are in tune
-the short tube notes in the second register are close to being in tune
(after all it is a saxophone) [:)]

This indicates that both of Benade&#39;s requirements have been met and the
mouthpiece has produced a good match with the instrument.  Of course
this assumes a degree of skill on the part of the player, reed that is
working well, and a constant, moderate temperature.   I don&#39;t believe
that the fact that it is not possible to measure any of these variables
to perfection should prevent one from even trying to do these types of
studies.   If the "perfect" is allowed to be the enemy of the "good"
then there would be no progress at all in understanding this area of
acoustics a little better.  N&#39;est pas?

  Hi John,

  I&#39;m back after four days in the wilds of South China. Trying to catch up here...

  Both of those are my statements. What I mean in both is that a small change in embouchure tension can result in a huge change in pitch in many notes while playing. I can vary the second register notes +- 30 cents easily with minor changes in my embouchure. In fact, when testing variations in mpc volume I found it almost impossible NOT to compensate, so I really have no way of really knowing what the added or subtracted volume did to the register relationships. 

  The fly in the ointment here is the fact that "normal embouchure" is nothing of the sort: it is not set in stone. The fact that the embouchure tension to a significant extent determines the pitch of the played note both allows us to "sing" with the horn and to add vibrato. It is one of the characteristics that makes the sax a very expressive instrument.

  Given that, HTH can you pretend to accurately measure volume and Frs, and even if you could, how relevant are those numbers given that the player can vary them significantly with the twitch of the chin?

    Lance have you tried to measure the "effective volume"  of any of your mouthpiece and reed set-ups as done in the linked study yet?  It is really quite easy to do.  From these effective volume trials it is my observation and conclusion that the effect of the  impedance of the reed  upon the frequency of the played pitch is already accounted for and incorporated into the sounding pitch.  Of course the player needs to play using the same embouchure pressure and dynamic level each time to get a consistent result.

Further, there are reed parameters that have influence but which cannot be measured accurately. You might remember that Nederveen talks about the fact that double reeds do not have an internal volume anywhere near that of the missing cone, but that the oboe,for example, still manages to play in tune due to compensating effect of the reeds themselves.

However, the one of the main purposes of this group is to have theoretical acoustic discussions.  Emperical testing is also encouraged.  But theoretical discussion will not be discouraged here.  It will help determine what should be tested.

Toby,

You are both right, and wrong.  While there is no practical application of this stuff for the masses - it&#39;s not going to help you design a mouthpiece that will work for everyone on any horn - it certainly is practically applicable to the individual advanced player/mouthpiece/horn/reed, combination.  The advanced player&#39;s embouchure is as good as set-in-stone.

            <pre class='message__body'>What a silly thing to say Lance.  "Set in stone" means unmovable and
unchanging.  Most players who play different styles use a different
embouchure for classical than they do for jazz.  I know that is true for
me.  The jazz embouchure is more relaxed in the corners especially and
produces a lower mouthpiece pitch.  If my embouchure were "set in stone"
I would not be able to:

1.  Lip notes in tune
2. Play with vibrato
3.  Do glissandos, scoops, and falls
4.  Play with a subtone
5.  Change the sound between jazz and classical playing

What you should have said is through muscle memory and good listening
habits an advanced player has good control over his embouchure and can
apply the chosen pressure level consistently.

To say "empirical analysis does not work"  demonstrates a lack of
understanding of the term empirical.
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical>

Artificial embouchures for both brass and woodwind instruments have been
used by acoustic scientists for many years to accurately measure and
quantify  the sound wave produced in different settings without the
variable of the human player.  Even the best human player cannot come
close to the repeatability of a machine when it comes to producing
exactly the same pressure on the reed, and exactly the same volume and
pressure of air in hundreds of trials.   To call that a "worthless idea"
demonstrates a total lack of understanding of how acoustic science  is
conducted.

the oboe,for example, still manages to play in tune due to compensating
effect of the reeds themselves.

consistent as possible.  He knows exactly where his "center of gravity"
is on his instrument.  From that point, it is entirely possible to get
very accurate measurements of the original setup and to compare them to
the theoretically optimal for that player/horn/mouthpiece combination,
and make some comparison trials.

is, all his examples use the oboe, and it&#39;s just not that easy to
measure the effective cavity of an oboe since it is the way the reed
vibrates that determines it.  He does get pretty specific and Hertzy,
when describing how to align the modes of a certain note, in order for
it to respond, tune, and sound better.

different continents. I note with interest that all of your so called

            <pre class='message__body'>I have yet to see one scrap of information about acoustics in any post
by Steve Goodson to date in this or the previous forum.  All of the
content of his posts so far in threads about acoustics have been nothing
more than boasting about his products and accomplishments and making
derogatory comments about those who are discussing acoustic theory and
its applications.  I wonder why he even participates if that is all he
has to offer.    Usually when a record keeps skipping and repeating
itself over and over, I remove it from the turntable, but that&#39;s just
me.

The following are a few examples of acoustic scientists who do not
believe that an "artificially blown instrument" or "artificial
embouchure" is a worthless idea as Steve Goodson claims.

I for one would like to discuss acoustic theory without the constant
heckling and being put down because I don&#39;t make and sell things  on the
internet.  Some of us actually make an "honest living" and study
acoustics for fun and knowledge.  There is nothing wrong with that.  So
Steve, I&#39;m elling you that you are wrong.

            <pre class='message__body'>The one thing that an artificial embouchure would probably be good for is to eliminate the player variables to get consistent readings, but you are right that at the end of the day whatever comes of all this measuring and testing has to be played to find out its validity in the real world.  

I do think that such testing has its place, and provides at least a step up from the pure theory, but it can only be a road map, it cannot be the road.

You&#39;re right on the money,  Toby. There are too many variables which have a very significant effect on  pitch. This is why empirical analysis does not work, you have to build horns and  PLAY them. The math is only a rough starting point, the proof is in the playing.  It is also why an artificial
 embouchure is a worthless idea, unless you are  trying to build horns that will only be played by robots. I can think of no  other application.

        Hi John,

I&#39;m back after four days in the wilds of South China.    Trying to catch up here...

Both of those are my statements. What I mean    in both is that a small change in embouchure tension can result in a huge    change in pitch in many notes while playing. I can vary the second register    notes +- 30 cents easily with minor changes in my embouchure. In fact, when    testing
 variations in mpc volume I found it almost impossible NOT to    compensate, so I really have no way of really knowing what the added or    subtracted volume did to the register relationships. 

The fly in the    ointment here is the fact that "normal embouchure" is nothing of the sort: it    is not set in stone. The fact that the embouchure tension to a significant    extent determines the pitch of the played note both allows us to "sing" with    the horn and to add vibrato. It is one of
 the characteristics that makes the    sax a very expressive instrument.

Given that, HTH can you pretend to    accurately measure volume and Frs, and even if you could, how relevant are    those numbers given that the player can vary them significantly with the    twitch of the chin?

I am not sure I      understand exactly what you mean by the above statement.  Can you      elaborate?

Lance have      you tried to measure the      "effective volume"  of any of your mouthpiece and reed set-ups as      done in the linked study yet?  It is really quite easy to do.       From these effective volume trials it is my observation and conclusion that      the effect of the  impedance of
 the reed  upon the frequency of      the played pitch is already accounted for and incorporated into the sounding      pitch.  Of course the player needs to play using the same embouchure      pressure and dynamic level each time to get a consistent      result.

 and airstream which incorporates muscle memory developed from thousands of hours of playing and compare that to the fixed pitch of the tuner.  If they match isn&#39;t perfect, then move their tuning device, sometimes a very minor amount to adjust the length of the instrument to the temperature of the
 room or hall at that time.  
--I disagree to some extent. Musicians first tune to notes that are harder to lip up or down, usually around the middle of the first register (or between the bottom and the middle). They then dynamically tune as they play, based--as you say--on thousands of hours of practice. This is not so much
 different than a violin player knowing exactly where to put her finger to get a note on a fretless fingerboard, or more exactly, the neighborhood, which is then fine-tuned by extremely quick finger shadings based on feedback from what she hears.
--A sax player, after tuning to a general pitch center, adjusts each note dynamically and almost instantaneously (if he is good) with fine embouchure and breath pressure adjustments to hit the correct pitch as he plays or in response to the pitch of other instruments around him. If this were not
 the case, it would be impossible to play in tune, given the intonational compromises of the instrumental system in its entirety.



If the musician did not have this embouchure sensitivity, he could not accurately tune the instrument to begin with.  Of course even the best musician would be hard pressed to pick up the instrument and in 20 trials produce right from the start, the exact same frequency down the the last hertz. 
 This is why I believe the artificial embouchure device (if it works) will be a useful tool in these studies.
--In a number of trials, it was found that even professional musicians generally cannot hit pitch to within 10 cents in repeated trials without a reference (this was with flute players). Some were up to 20 cents off. Of course as soon as there is an external pitch to reference to this changes
 completely.

It is true that absolute accuracy is not possible in either calculating the length and volume of the missing cone or calculating the natural resonant frequency  of the length of the neck + the missing cone + end correction.  However, if a good approximation of those values can be determined, then
 comparing that calculated frequency to the actual played frequency of the mouthpiece plus neck can give a good idea of whether or not the mouthpiece in that position on the cork is acting as an effective substitution for the missing cone.
--Agreed. The keywords (and point of contention) here are "good approximation". My own little tests have shown that if the player is in tune in the first register, the mpc is acting as a good approximation. The question then becomes what happens to the second register and above, and if there are
 intonational variations whether the problem lies in the mpc or in the body itself, or some combination of the two. It seems to me that the most valuable study, rather than endless minute calculation of the volume and frs of the mpc and/or neck, would be as follows: 

--Put a mpc on the horn and blow it with your artificial embouchure, choosing one note to tune to. It doesn&#39;t matter whether it is exactly like a real player. Just find out--with a given mpc/reed--how the general note-to-note tuning is and what the octave relationships are with a non-changing
 embouchure pressure+breath pressure for a series of notes. 

--I would tune to G1 and then play from bottom to top (insofar as possible using the artificial embouchure. Probably it will not be possible to play the lowest notes with the same setting as for the upper notes). This will give you a good idea about the intonational tendencies of the horn due to
 tone hole placement (the entire first mode from low Bb through C#2), and the octave relationships (D2-F3). A second test would be to detune G1 by a given amount (say +- 20 cents) and again run the notes and record the intonational tendencies across all registers.
--This will immediately show you how changing the mpc volume affects the register relationships, and perhaps intonational trends within registers from long- to short-tube notes.

--Now change the mpc volume and reset the mpc so that it is in tune at G1. Repeat the tests and see if there is an average difference in the mode relationships. This should give you a good idea what real-world effects changing the mpc volume have on intonation after the mpc is reset to play the
 base note (G1) in tune again.

--Personally, it seems to me that this would be a much more fruitful use of your time and skill than trying to figure out volumes and resonant frequencies and match them against a hypothetical missing cone, (especially when you don&#39;t even know how to calculate that latter value due to variations
 in the conicity of the sax body/neck).

-the instrument tunes to AD0
-the long tube low B and Bb along with their 2nd partials are in tune
-the low F and middle F octaves are in tune 
-the short tube notes in the second register are close to being in tune (after all it is a saxophone)

This indicates that both of Benade&#39;s requirements have been met and the mouthpiece has produced a good match with the instrument.  Of course this assumes a degree of skill on the part of the player, reed that is working well, and a constant, moderate temperature.   I don&#39;t believe that the fact
 that it is not possible to measure any of these variables to perfection should prevent one from even trying to do these types of studies.   If the "perfect" is allowed to be the enemy of the "good" then there would be no progress at all in understanding this area of acoustics a little better. 
 N&#39;est pas?
--C&#39;est s$B>-iS(Bement vrai. However one must make sure that the quest for perfection does not stop one from making progress in the good. One other note: saxes are not designed to overblow B and Bb, so those notes should not be used to check  mode relationships.

I can imagine many uses for an artificial saxophone/saxophone mouthpiece blowing machine, but I fail to see how any test results from such a machine can be of any possible practical use to anyone saxophone, unless the machine has at least, a static, upstream coupled resonating chamber equivalent to that of the human player.

      What a silly thing to say Lance.  "Set in stone" means unmovable and

unchanging.  Most players who play different styles use a different

embouchure for classical than they do for jazz.  I know that is true for

me.  The jazz embouchure is more relaxed in the corners especially and

produces a lower mouthpiece pitch.  If my embouchure were "set in stone"

I would not be able to:



1.  Lip notes in tune

2. Play with vibrato

3.  Do glissandos, scoops, and falls

4.  Play with a subtone

5.  Change the sound between jazz and classical playing



What you should have said is through muscle memory and good listening

habits an advanced player has good control over his embouchure and can

apply the chosen pressure level consistently.

design a mouthpiece that will work for everyone on any horn - it

certainly is practically applicable to the individual advanced

player/mouthpiece/ horn/reed, combination.  The advanced player&#39;s

embouchure is as good as set-in-stone.
