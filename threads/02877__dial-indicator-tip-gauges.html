            <pre class='message__body'>Well... they&#39;re almost done!
 
The first batch of gauges is coming along nicely. I have found that I am
required to do other things, though... like work and be with my wife on
occasion! Anyway, the first ones are coming off the line. I have pictures
posted on my website. You can follow the advertising link on the first page
if you would like to see them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Steve,
I am reallylooking forward to getting the tip guage. But the real reason that I am sending this note is to tell you how impressed I was with the rebuild that you did on the Zephyr tenor...WOW!! man, you are not a repairman...you are an artist!! Great work
best regards,
James
