            <pre class='message__body'>I suggest that group members lead the discussion to define acceptable 
form of advertising rather than leaving it up to vague guidlines. 
It&#39;s one thing to give us a heads up on a really good deal but 
blatant advertising (in uppercase) even from one of our communities 
most repected technician, is clearly crossing the line.
