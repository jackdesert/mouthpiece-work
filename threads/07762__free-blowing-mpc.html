            <pre class='message__body'>Ted, have you measured that Meyer to determine the curve, and tip opening? If so, would you be willing to post those measurements here? Thanks, 
Doug

On my alto I have a NY Meyer hand finished by Frank Wells and there is no effort at all blowing this MPC on ANY alto.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have found a radial facing curve with a long facing length to be the most free-blowing.  Perhaps too free-blowing unless the tip opening is wide.

Wow this really sucks. I wrote responses 2x and the pop-up from Yahoo asking about sharing/ rich text option comes up, I make my choice and preview my message, try to go back to edit...I lose everything. What&#39;s the deal here?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have no control over Yahoo issues (that I know of).  I have not experienced what you are describing.  Are you responding via Email or via the group site?  Both should work but on may work better for you.

I would also suggest composing long replies in a word processor so you do not lose everything because of a glitch.  After composing, just cut/paste the reply to the group.
