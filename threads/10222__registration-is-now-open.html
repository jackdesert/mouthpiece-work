2012&#39;s SMACKDOWN is going to be an event you cant miss! Register now  
because space is limited! This SMACKDOWN will be an amazing gathering  
of repair technicians, players, craftsman, and manufacturers.

Two full days! Last year&#39;s SMACKDOWN was a huge success but everyone  
agreed that we needed more time!

Free. Well the SMACKDOWN itself is not free (almost, at $110) but you  
do get free breakfasts, free snacks, free drinks (bring your ID!),  
free lunches, more free drinks... that&#39;s a lotta free no matter who ya  
are!

More time with the clinicians. All of the clinicians at the 2012  
SMACKDOWN are staying for the entire event. Take advantage of learning  
from the clinicians, your hosts, and other technicians during the  
whole two-day event. There will be plenty time to sip your drink and  
discuss your favorite techniques!

Dinner! Although you have to pay for your own dinner, MusicMedic.com  
has arranged restaurants for the entire gang to go out and eat.  
Dinners will set up in panel-style discussion seating with all four  
clinicians, Steve Goodson, and Curt Altarac answering questions and  
moderating the informal dinner discussions.

Watch the work as it happens! Talk is cheap. Theo Wanne and Jason  
DuMars are doing more than talking, they&#39;re working. Bring your  
mouthpiece or pick one up from Theo at the SMACKDOWN. Theo will have  
his tools and is prepared to put a custom face on your new Theo Wanne  
Mouthpiece or do work to your older pieces. Jason will be offering  
engraving right here at the SMACKDOWN (be sure to let us know you&#39;re  
interested ahead of time as his time is limited!)

Exhibits! Many of the clincians this year have products that they want  
you to see! After you hear their ideas, you can see their work! Check  
out this small, personal, and pertinent group of exhibits.

MusicMedic.com Sax ProShop Tour We&#39;ve been busy since the last  
SMACKDOWN and there are a lot of exciting changes! We&#39;ll take you  
through the shop and show how the world&#39;s only assembly-line woodwind  
repair shop functions. The Sax ProShop has been compared to "standing  
inside an exploded saxophone overhaul". Curt will walk you through the  
shop, stopping at each of the 10 stations and explaining what we do  
and how we do it. There is no better way to understand the saxophone  
overhaul than walking through it!

Live Music by Wally West and the North Carolina Saxophone Ensemble!  
You&#39;re going to love the Music this year! During Friday lunch, you can  
relax and chat as you hear the cool tunes provided by RooPad endorser  
Wally West and his fabulous trio! Rumor has it that our own Rich  
Zimmerman may sit in and play a tune or two! On Saturday you&#39;re going  
to love having lunch with the North Carolina Saxophone Ensemble. If  
you look in the back row of this massive saxophone collaboration,  
you&#39;ll see MusicMedic.com&#39;s founder Curt Altarac playing the Bass!

So relax, grab a drink, and have a talk with a factory owner. Tap your  
toes to a cool solo and catch a glimpse of Jason cutting a flower or  
Theo teaching a refacing technique. Just be sure you don&#39;t miss it  
because there will be only one SMACKDOWN II, and it will be RAW!
