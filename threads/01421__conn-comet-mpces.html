            <pre class='message__body'>I have right now, a few Conn Comet alto and tenor mouthpieces.  These
are all #7&#39;s.  

These are freshly finished from some 1940&#39;s blanks found at the Runyon
factory.  They are not marked Conn, but stamped Runyon instead.

All are transparent amber in color.  The altos are dark, nearly
orange, which might be why they were not made into mouthpieces way
back then.  The tenors appear to be the correct shade.

The Comet alto and tenor have large rounded chambers, medium baffle. 
The tone from these is sweet, smooth and rich, not at all edgy or
bright.  A great near classical tone that is perfect for swing era big
band, theatre pit orchestra, etc.  These work very well on the classic
vintage saxes.

The Comet alto was used by Marshall Royal in all of his recordings
with the Count Basie Orchestra.  The current Basie lead alto, John
Kelson, is using Marshall&#39;s old Comet.  The late Bill Green had five
of these, and when he passed away, had willed them to Plas Johnson,
who uses them now on alto.

$80 + $5 shipping on the alto Comets, $90 + $5 shipping on the tenor
Comets.

            <pre class='message__body'>The altos are marked 7, actually measure .081"-.083".  The tenors are 
marked 7, actually measure .093"-.094".

I played one I picked out of the altos at random at sax ensemble 
rehearsal yesterday, and it was perfect for that... but we do more of 
big band, ragtime, type stuff.  We are a little more Nuclear Whales than 
Amhearst.

These are great mpces!  A few years back, at, I think Texas Bandmasters, 
I was attending with Santy Runyon.  A guy from Conn came by the booth, 
and took some altos, tenors, and baris.  At the time he implied they 
were going to make some more dies.  Conn had paid for and owned the 
original dies, and later DISCARDED them!  I think somewhere in my 
archives I have an email from a guy at Conn saying they were destoyed 
when Conn tossed a lot of old tooling for the 6M and 10M horns, and 
other older horns.  Conn is honest when they say the tooling for old 
horns just does not exist.  THEY DESTOYED IT.

FYI, if you like the old Conn Comet bari piece, the current Runyon 88 is 
nearly identical.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Paul,
I&#39;d be interested in one of the alto pieces. Cap/lig
included? How would you like money sent (and where)?
Have a good holiday. Peace.
