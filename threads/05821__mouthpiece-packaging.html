            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone know where to find packaging supplies for mouthpieces for 
sale(mouthpiece boxes, etc.)?  I&#39;d like to ship out my mouthpieces to 
some buddies of mine, but I wanted the packaging to look somewhat 
good.  I&#39;ve seen those small white cardboard boxes used by Hawkins and 
other mouthpiece makers, but can&#39;t seem to locate them.  Got any 
ideas?  Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had some Links to packaging companies a while back but now I can not find

have a large hex head on the top/bottom.  

I also have seen 2-pc plastic "boxes" like router bits often come in.  They
come in all sizes and lengths.  You just need to keep searching until you
stumble on a industry-specific key word that describes the type of
container you are interested in.

            <pre class='message__body'>Home Depot has some clear plastic tubes, with various colored vinyl caps on each end, sold for storing screws and other small hardware.  These are similar to the ones you describe, and are ideal for mouthpieces.  Just stick a piece of foam in each end to protect the tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>Rose-Plastic is the manufacturer.  However, they are EXTREMELY hard to do business with ... unless you want to do buy huge (1000-5000) quantities of a container size at a time. However, there is a special un-affiliated Rose company that will "book" smaller quantities at Rose --- they put orders together and can buy overstocks.  They will sell smaller quantities of particular size container for what amounts to be fairly reasonable prices.  If you check with sales people at Rose they can give you the name of the lady who runs this special ROSE buying company.  good luck.
