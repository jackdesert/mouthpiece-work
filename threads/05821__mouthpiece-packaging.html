            <pre class='message__body'>Rose-Plastic is the manufacturer.  However, they are EXTREMELY hard to do business with ... unless you want to do buy huge (1000-5000) quantities of a container size at a time. However, there is a special un-affiliated Rose company that will "book" smaller quantities at Rose --- they put orders together and can buy overstocks.  They will sell smaller quantities of particular size container for what amounts to be fairly reasonable prices.  If you check with sales people at Rose they can give you the name of the lady who runs this special ROSE buying company.  good luck.
