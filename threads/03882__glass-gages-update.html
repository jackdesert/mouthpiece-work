            <pre class='message__body'>I have the glass blanks in hand.  However, the first samples back from 
the low bid Laser engraver were not of good quality.  The fine lines 
may be beyond what is capable by most Lasers sold for engraving.  They 
came out chippy and blurry.

I&#39;m now persueing a couple of engravers who can also do "sand 
carving".  They put some kind of hard/soft transparency on the glass 
and the sand blasts away the soft areas.  The first sample I have seen 
looks acceptable.  It will still be a few weeks until I get finished 
gages in hand.

I&#39;m probabably going to alter the set back design slightly from the 
gages Babbitt sells.  Their scale is set back 3.5 mm from the edge.  
I&#39;m looking at increasing this to 8 mm.  This would better allow the 
option of zeroing a mouthpiece tip on the gage by using something like 
the .125" feeler many of us have.  It works if the tip opening is 
below .125".  (This was suggested to me by one of our clever silent 
members.)  You can try it out by zeroing your mouthpieces at 10 on your 
current gage and subtracting 10 from your readings.
