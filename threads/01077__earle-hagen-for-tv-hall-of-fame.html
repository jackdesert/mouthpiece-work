 Hi Paul

I just wanted to tell you about the latest news surrounding Earle Hagen.

There&#39;s a campaign going on to induct him in the TV Hall of Fame.  Of
the 90 members, there is no musician or composer included, and we think
that Earle Hagen should be the first.

I&#39;m hoping that you will join us in the campaign by adding your support
with a message to Bryce Zabel, Chairman of the Television Academy.  His
email address is:

bryce@...

Anything you want to write is fine, but you might say something like I
was surprised to learn that there are no musicians or composers in the
TV Hall of Fame, and hope this will be changed soon with the addition of
the name Earle Hagen.

My own submission - with more details - is included below.

Hoping for your support on this with

best regards,

Chantal Ni Laoghaire


Dear Bryce Zabel!

As webmaster of The Best of All Worlds internet salute to Earle Hagen,
(http://www.earlehagen.net) I would like to state the most important
points which make Earle Hagen an ideal choice to be the first musician
to be named to the Academy&#39;s Hall of Fame.

He is one of the pioneers of television music, and is thankfully, still
around to accept the honor in person.

For most of the shows he worked on, each week, Earle Hagen presented a
new and original score. This has even greater weight when one realizes
that, in the mid-sixties, he was working on five series at the same
time, one of which was the hour-long drama "I Spy."

All his music for television was recorded in Los Angeles by local
musicians.

Earle Hagen not only made his own direct contributions as composer,
arranger and conductor, he also gave three decades to teaching the craft
of scoring to talented and aspiring candidates selected by BMI.

He produced the bible on writing for the screen, "Scoring for Films"
(and the sequel "Advanced Techniques"), used in every school where
composing for motion pictures and TV is taught.

His themes and scores graced some 3000 television episodes, most of the
product produced by Sheldon Leonard - including "The Dick Van Dyke Show"
and "The Danny Thomas Show."  His self-whistled theme for "The Andy
Griffith Show" is still, after four decades, heard each and every day in
thousands of homes across America.

Beloved by all who know him, and know of him, Emmy-winner Earle Hagen
has inspired many professionals and fans alike, and in my opinion,
deservedly merits inclusion as the first member of the music branch to
be inducted into the TV Hall of Fame.

Yours sincerely

Chantal Ni Laoghaire
(former Academy member)

Paul here again:

I must add that I learned much of my craft from Earle Hagen&#39;s Scoring
for Films, and Henry Mancini&#39;s Scores and Sounds.

Please take the time to drop an email to Bryce Zabel at

Thanks,

Paul
