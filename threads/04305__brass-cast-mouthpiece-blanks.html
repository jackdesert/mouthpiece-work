            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I used to post on here a long time ago, when this group got started 
and I was into refacing pieces. I&#39;ve since been developing and 
manufacturing my own mouthpieces.  Currently I&#39;m looking into making 
metal mouthpieces and wondering if anyone here knows where I could get 
brass blanks for mouthpieces sand cast or investment cast. I would 
provide the master model, then do the facing / baffle / etc machining 
on the blanks when I get them. Metal pieces can be smaller than the 
cast acrylic I&#39;m using and maintain more strength with thinner walls -
- just for a different feel more like a Link or other metal mpc. 

Thanks
Ken
