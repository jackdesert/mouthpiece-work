Im just getting started here so first, hello all.  Ive been trying to 
absorb information in the first several hundred posts. I noticed that 
there have been combined orders for blanks in the past.  Is any such 
activity occuring now or in the near future (specifically tenor 
blanks).  Im currently plotting the destruction of numerous pieces so 
they might as well be cheap. Thanks.
Philip

            <pre class='message__body'>I still have a few of the brass tenor blanks made for us via eMachineShop. 
They are $20 + 5 s/h in the US.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, Philip, I had arranged that, and may do so again if I get enough 
orders.
