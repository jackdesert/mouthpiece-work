I use a circular flourescent type from Harbor Freight 
www.harborfreight.com  That often goes on sale for $29.99 (reg price
is $39.99 I believe) and the light is a soft bluish color which is
very helpful for fine detail work.  The arms stay pretty much where
you put them and the magnification is good for this type of work.

They&#39;re available in a variety of magnifications, and are hands free, once you get the knack of gripping them in your eye socket. 

I think they&#39;re fabulous.
They are inexpensive, and available from Lee Valley Tools.

  I find that I frequently need to use some type of magnification when 
  working on mouthpieces. Some hands-free system (as opposed to a 
  hand-held magnifying glass) seems like a good idea. I&#39;ve seen

I find it convenient to slip on some higher strength reading glasses for
close & fine mouthpiece work - the local "Dollar Tree" sells &#39;em for a buck
a pair.

If one eye is weaker than the other (in my case, the left eye), it&#39;s
possible to buy 2 pairs of glasses, and swap lenses as needed. If one&#39;s Rx
is, for example 200 on the R and 225 on the L, as long as one bumps up lens
power by the same difference, it works, eg 225/250, 250/275.

Something that looks good are some flip-up magnifiers sold by Micro-Mat,
that can attach to one&#39;s regular glasses, but I haven&#39;t tried them.

I have several different magnification visors, most of which I bought from

The most important thing you do is be sure to have PLENTY of light. As we

directed specifically at the work at hand.

proper lighting can make. Remember, too much is always better than not

            <pre class='message__body'>I picked up a set of three with different magnifications for $5.00 from a flea market vendor.  You get terrific magnification, although with limited depth of field and the loss of binocular vision.  They have been VERY useful for me.  The magnifying fluorescent light is also nice, but not sufficiently powerful for really fine detail.

  They&#39;re available in a variety of magnifications, and are hands free, once you get the knack of gripping them in your eye socket. 
   
  I think they&#39;re fabulous.
  They are inexpensive, and available from Lee Valley Tools.

    I find that I frequently need to use some type of magnification when 
working on mouthpieces. Some hands-free system (as opposed to a 
hand-held magnifying glass) seems like a good idea. I&#39;ve seen 
bench-mount, circular fluorescent types, a smaller halogen-lit version 
(MicroMark), the giant-eyeglass-looking flip-down magnifiers, and I&#39;m 
sure there are more types out there. I&#39;d welcome any sharing of 
experiences and opinions.

Don&#39;t let the price fool you......They are the same  lenses I used to pay $15.00 "each" for, at Efston Scientific.

For  U.K  &  EU members I have found a source of Magnifiers at
www.westfalia.net
These range from watchmakers eyepieces, one with a headband, to an
anglepoise table clamping  5X  illuminated magnifier at £8.99. I have
examined  a friends one and think it is excellent value. The lamp is
tungsten 60W  ES. Perhaps not as good as the circular neon lit
electronics type, but then, they are expensive.

The only advantage in being short-sighted is, that by removing my specs,
I can focus at six  inches ---- then, I can&#39;t find my specs.  [:-B]
