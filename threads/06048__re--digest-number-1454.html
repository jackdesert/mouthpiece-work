            <pre class='message__body'>Fantastic, Bob!  Thank you.  I had been thinking about sympathetic 
resonance of the reed and air column - that it&#39;s not one or the other 
independently, but a resultant of how they work together (duh).  I 
need to dig out my old Systems Analysis notes and see if I can draw a 
schematic :)

This reverts back to a question I remember coming up a while back 
asking why reeds are designed the way they are.  The answer really 
is "because that is what works".  Some derivations are emperical - 
not necessarily scientific.

If reeds were designed differently, so would facings ;)
