            <pre class='message__body'>Merlin,

I have also been looking for clarinet mpc. curve info.  The Santy Runyon 
article in the files here was helpful, but basically just advocates for 
a radial curve.  Like many of us, I have a drawer full of not-so-good 
Buffetts, Vandorens, Yamahas, etc. to work on.   I&#39;ll measure my Robert 
Scott mouthpiece (plays great -  he makes them from Zinner blanks) and 
send you the data to add to your collection.  Keep me posted as you get 
data on good-playing mouthpieces.  Also, do you have any jazz vs. 
classical insights?

Dan
