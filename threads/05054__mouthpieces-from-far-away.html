            <pre class='message__body'>Folks,

Last time I checked, it was pretty challenging for anyone to make a
mouthpiece that allows a saxophone to sound like a musical instrument
(as opposed to a braying donkey).

My hat&#39;s off to anyone who can do it.  

I can&#39;t blame anyone for trying to make a buck.

Now if somebody can make a reed that works, perhaps music can be saved
after all.

Any "BRAYING DONKEYS" are a result of unskilled players, poor 
embouchure or lack of taste and ability. It is an unreasonable 
expectation that a mouthpiece is going to allow a player to bypass 
the effort and practice to bring out the artistry of a quality tone 
on the instrument. It also requires a lot of trial, error adjustment 
skills and expense to locate the ideal reed for whichever mouthpiece 
that one chooses. 

Some players sound great regardless of which horn, mouthpiece or reed 
they use and the braying donkey would be the opposite side of that 
coin.  The saxophone has a reputation for being "easy to play".  As 
Larry Teal would say: One word should be added to that 
statement. "The saxophone is easy to play BADLY"
