            <pre class='message__body'>The material J. Gerber uses is called Perspex in Europe (source: his 
post on SOTW).  It is a Lucite product.  It is basically 
plexiglass....cast acrylic marketed under this name.  In this country 
it is marketed under various other names (acrylite is one). I may give 
it a try.  It has good properties for mpc application from what I have 
discovered so far.  Its avaliable in a variety of colors and 
thicknesses.  It curves well when thin, its durable and can handle a 
wide range of PH values.  It may tollerate plating with the right 
adhesive.  If I get a sheet I will post results and source.

            <pre class='message__body'>Perspex is the European name for plain-vanilla plexiglass, as you note. Seems to me to be the ideal material for this application: no nasty chems to leach out, dimensionally stable, wear-resistant, and it comes in a variety of designer colors! You can even laminate it for special effects...
