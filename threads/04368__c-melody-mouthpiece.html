            <pre class='message__body'>Hi dears,

I&#39;ve an old Martin and a Conn Transitional on C. The Martin plays
great with a Leblanc for c-mel. I didn&#39;t find another good as that...
but if I play it on the Conn I get on the low notes starting from E
and D it start something like a wave sound. (why it&#39;s happen? camera
or bore vvolume can influence?) 
I think rules are the same on this kind of mp... but what is really
the difference from a tenor mp to the c-mel? They just looks the same
 but short the c-mel. I tested alto mps: all bad... but an old plastic
Babbitt with long facing and big window on the Conn it was playing
without the wave sound, correct blowing and so on. 
So many questions come in my mind because only things I know are
comune knowledges as big chamber, no baffle, etc etc....

Why this happen? What is the relation of the camera and the tube of
the c-mel. Let&#39;s suppose for absurd... a different neck can help the
mp to play correct? Or as I think I will never find a mouthpiece able
to play well on both the sax?

Size of chamber related to low baffle is an old way to make a
mouthpiece, but time is change. Who is able today to make a new cut
for a c-mel mp in hard rubber? Somebody do? The mps on the market are
usefully Beechler, woodwind company, some others... but they don&#39;t
have a good sound for me. I would like to get a Morgan sound as the
excalibur, with good projection too, something missing on the old
style c-mel mouthpiece.

So men of big experience please come out and help me to understand
when possible! Thanks.

Ciao. Gian

  The C Melody sax plays well with tenor mouthpieces with medium to small chambers.  The C Melody mouthpiece that Runyon sells is their Model 88 tenor with the shank shortened.  It plays well on C Melody sax using tenor reeds.
   
  The facing length around 21-22 mm works well (42-44 on the E. Brand type gauges).  While old mouthpieces had a very narrow tip opening (as was the practice on all instruments) many players now are using tip openings of .086"-.090" (2.2 mm - 2.3 mm) on C Melody.

I did some bore measurements on a very old Conn curved-neck C mel that I have, and found that the bore is narrower than an alto! I prefer to play it with an alto piece, although I have to pull it almost all the way off the cork for it to be in tune. I have a few tenor pieces, none of which really sounds good on the C mel. They sound muffled and seem rather sluggish. I have a few original C mel mpcs, which are considerably smaller than tenor pieces, but with such absurdly small tip openings that I can hardly play them, even with the hardest reeds available.

I wonder if the problem that you are having with the "wave sound" on the lows might not have to do with a small leak somewhere on the Conn. I think you should get that checked out before getting a lot further into mpcs. It is very possible that one mpc (the Babbitt) might be more tolerant of some small leaks (depends also on your embouchure), especially if it has a more closed tip opening than the Leblanc.

  I wonder if the problem that you are having with the "wave sound" on the lows might not have to do with a small leak somewhere on the Conn. I think you should get that checked out before getting a lot further into mpcs. It is very possible that one mpc (the Babbitt) might be more tolerant of some small leaks (depends also on your embouchure), especially if it has a more closed tip opening than the Leblanc.

       Gian, I don&#39;t understand the term "camera" as you use it.  Sorry.
   
  The C Melody sax plays well with tenor mouthpieces with medium to small chambers.  The C Melody mouthpiece that Runyon sells is their Model 88 tenor with the shank shortened.  It plays well on C Melody sax using tenor reeds.
   
  The facing length around 21-22 mm works well (42-44 on the E. Brand type gauges).  While old mouthpieces had a very narrow tip opening (as was the practice on all instruments) many players now are using tip openings of .086"-.090" (2.2 mm - 2.3 mm) on C Melody.

 The tenor mp I use have at least tip .100 to .110 and big chamber or medium-big, same story for me thinking to old style mp stuffy. You&#39;ve right.
 As Paul said may be I will try a smaller chamber on tenor mp.
 
 The Conn have not leaking and have been checked with light... that was my first thinking too. He have also new black skin with resonator pads from Saxgourmet.

 I was thinking to some leak on the tuned wheel of the neck. This Conn have alto style neck and tuner... it&#39;s easy working up and down, no stocked, but should be possible?

  You know the "dollar bill trick" to clean the G# pad so that it does not stick?  I was told that a $50 bill cleans the G# pad much better, but being a musician, I would not know from experience.
   
  Do, Re, Mi...
   
  For us, C is always C, D is always D, E is always E.
   
  But if in key of C, Do is C.  If in the key of G, Do is G, Re is A, Mi is B.  And in the key of E, Do is E, Re is F#, Mi is G#.... 
   
  So we do use Do, Re, Me, but to describe the first note of the scale, second note, third note, etc.
   
  Now those silly Brits... an 8th note is a quaver.  A 16th note is a semiquaver...
   
  And if you play music by Percy Grainger, he would not use Italian expression markings.  He would mark the music "Louden" instead of "Crescendo", or "Quicken" instead of "Accelerando".
   
  I&#39;ll remember that... Camera... room or chamber.  Yes, it makes sense.

Do, is always Do, Re is always Re, etcÂ too :-)

 

You can be either in the Ut (Do) key (= C) , Sib (Bb) key or even in the
Mib (Eb) key !

 

But I do think the hart of the question was : why use A, B, CÂ. G and
not Do, Re, MiÂ.Si?

Gian, I alway use that as a joke... "I speak some Italian, but being a 
musician, I only know the adverbs."

You know the "dollar bill trick" to clean the G# pad so that it does not 
stick?  I was told that a $50 bill cleans the G# pad much better, but being 
a musician, I would not know from experience.

Do, Re, Mi...

For us, C is always C, D is always D, E is always E.

But if in key of C, Do is C.  If in the key of G, Do is G, Re is A, Mi is B. 
And in the key of E, Do is E, Re is F#, Mi is G#....

So we do use Do, Re, Me, but to describe the first note of the scale, second 
note, third note, etc.

Now those silly Brits... an 8th note is a quaver.  A 16th note is a 
semiquaver...

And if you play music by Percy Grainger, he would not use Italian expression 
markings.  He would mark the music "Louden" instead of "Crescendo", or 
"Quicken" instead of "Accelerando".

I&#39;ll remember that... Camera... room or chamber.  Yes, it makes sense.

Paul

Our word "camera" comes from the old "camera obscura", a device that focused 
a pinhole image on the wall of a darkened room.

But a camera in Italy is called a "macchina fotografica"...go figure...

  Do, is always Do, Re is always Re, etcï¿½ too J
   
  You can be either in the Ut (Do) key (= C) , Sib (Bb) key or even in the Mib (Eb) key !
   
  But I do think the hart of the question was : why use A, B, Cï¿½. G and not Do, Re, Miï¿½.Si?

The only thing to remember, is that either Beethoven, Mozart AND Parker,
Miles (among others) made Music (with a big M), Do Re Mi or A, B, C
being just a small representation of the Music itself, rather not
complete (the map is not the territory :-) )

              Hi Gian
   
  The only thing to remember, is that either Beethoven, Mozart AND Parker, Miles (among others) made Music (with a big M), Do Re Mi or A, B, C being just a small representation of the Music itself, rather not complete (the map is not the territory J )

        Yes Jack... you catch! You&#39;re French... you know well...

Beethoven and Mozart used Do Re Mi but Parker and Miles?

Best for italian is to read an american drums partiture... just tz tz tz and ta ta ta!
