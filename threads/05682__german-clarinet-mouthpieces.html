            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone ever done any measuring or reworking on German-style
soprano clarinet mouthpieces? What do the facing curves look like?
What are the chambers like (internal volume, dimensions, etc)? What
are the differences and similarities between German and French? Any
special precautions or tricks? Thanks for any and all info. - Brent

            <pre class='message__body'>I have not really done much work on German Clarinet Mouthpieces, but I
have measured a few and I was playing on them for a couple years.
Generally, they are very very long and very very narrow.  My 0.03mm
feeler (sorry, I don&#39;t know what it is in inches) goes more than the
45 mark and a 1mm feeler sometimes just bearly goes in- sometimes a
1mm won&#39;t even make it in the tip at all.
They are also generally longer than French pieces and the bore is
bigger and the beak is smaller- playing them is almost like playing
Saxophone in terms of mouthpiece angle.
All of this can vary greatly and the few pieces I worked with are by
no means the only things out there.  If you are looking for really
good German pieces to play, I highly suggest AW.  I have an Eb piece
from them to go with a German Effer that is just great. www.aw-

            <pre class='message__body'>I just finished getting the measurements on my Fritz Wurlitzer with the inscription Erlbach i.v. and three inscribed pierced dots to the side of the lay.  I came up with the following measurements:  A. 40110; B. 10; C. 5; D. 3; E. tip opening 20 mm.  This is a very loud focused German mouthpiece that has the grooves around the body for the string ligature.

Just to be clear, what set of feeler gages are you using?  What are their
thicknesses?  Also is "40110" looks strange and a 20 mm tip opening is too
large to make sense.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

What seems odd is that a shank bore is commonly around 15mm opening.

So a tip opening of 20mm seems unrealistic - I don&#39;t know how a reed 
can vibrate in that curve ? assuming there was enough height to the 
beak.

You should also be able to easily measure it with a generic ruler at 
that point.  How are you measuring it ?

Can you upload a pic, or a link ?

Stephen

So maybe the tip is 2.0 mm, not 20 mm.  Or maybe the facing length is 20
mm.

Again, what set of feeler gages are you using and what does "40110" represent.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have an explanation of the figure "40110". This is a
very old method (about 1930 in USA) but very efficient
of identify the characteristics of a mouthpiece id
est:
First two figures in this case 40 is the plane lenght
in half of a mm i.e. 20mm
The last three figures 110 is tip aperture in cents of
mm.
So that piece it is equivalent to a Vandoren B44 more
closed than a the more famous B40.
This notation was expressly used by O&#39;Brien and
sometimes also today clarinettist like Cecil Gold
still use it in their books as a short way of
rappresenting a piece.

H E R B were his facings, h being the most closed and b being the most open. He always told me this was for the European market especially Scandinavia as they liked open mouthpieces with very soft reeds.

It is not very difficult to understand "40110":

The first two figures, in this case 40, is the plane
lenght expressed in half of mm unit i.e. 20mm which is
a medium short plane lenght

The last three figures 110 is tip aperture in cents of
mm.
The only strange thing is the use of half of mm as
measure unit expecially for 1930 american people.

  Place the gauge directly on a piece of glass or other flat surface.  Does it read zero?
   
  Note that you read the gauge BACKWARDS from zero as the probe drops down.

  40110 -- 110 would be 1.10 mm tip opening 
   
  1.1 mm / 25.4 mm/inch = .043" tip opening.
   
  20 mm / 25.4 mm/in = 0.787"  That is more than 3/4 of an inch.  
   
  Even if there is a missing decimal...
   
  2.0 mm / 25.4 = .078"  That is a good alto saxophone tip opening.  I have seen some soprano sax tip openings that large, but I have never seen a clarinet tip opening that large.

Even 0.02 sounds too small for a clarinet mouthpiece.  Clarinet tip 
openings typically run from about .039" (1.0 mm) to .047" (1.2 mm).  
Of course, there are a few that are smaller, and Jazz/Dixieland 
players that may play as large as .055" (1.4 mm) or larger.  The 
clue is in the 40110 code on the piece.  40 is the facing length in 
half mm&#39;s, so the facing length is 20 mm&#39;s.  The 110 indicated 1.10 
mm tip opening, or .043".

I think the problem you are having is that dial indicators read 
directly when the probe is pushed up into the gauge.  They can be 
adjusted for a zero point by placing the gauge and fixture on a flat 
surface (thick glass, machined metal surface, etc), and drop below 
that to -.200".

When the gauge fixture is placed against the table of the mouthpiece 
(where the reed rests), the probe placed to touch in the middle of 
the tip rail, the gauge reads below that zero point (the plane of 
the mouthpiece&#39;s table).  The gauge must be read in reverse, 
counting back from zero.

So, what must be done is that you place your gauge and fixture (or 
holder) on a flat surface, and move the gauge up and down in the 
fixture until it reads zero with the probe touching the flat 
surface.  As you lift the gauge/fixture from the surface, the probe 
will drop down and give a negative reading, dropping as far as -
.200".

Why .200" and not .100"?  Because you will not find any mouthpiece 
with as much as .200" tip opening, even bari and bass sax.  But you 
will find many tenor, bari, and bass sax mouthpieces larger 
than .100".

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your reply.  I do have the device set up to read zero on a flat glass.  Now, when I place it directly on the mouthpiece tip it reads a red number of 20.  With it set to zero how can I communicate that number correctly so it would be understood by all. The maker of the device said that I should use the read number and it is read in thousands.  I think you are about to teach me something and I greatly appreciate it.  Steven

I think the problem you are having is that dial indicators read 

directly when the probe is pushed up into the gauge.  They can be 

adjusted for a zero point by placing the gauge and fixture on a flat 

surface (thick glass, machined metal surface, etc), and drop below 

that to -.200".



When the gauge fixture is placed against the table of the mouthpiece 

(where the reed rests), the probe placed to touch in the middle of 

the tip rail, the gauge reads below that zero point (the plane of 

the mouthpiece&#39;s table).  The gauge must be read in reverse, 

counting back from zero.



So, what must be done is that you place your gauge and fixture (or 

holder) on a flat surface, and move the gauge up and down in the 

fixture until it reads zero with the probe touching the flat 

surface.  As you lift the gauge/fixture from the surface, the probe 

will drop down and give a negative reading, dropping as far as -

..200".



Why .200" and not .100"?  Because you will not find any mouthpiece 

with as much as .200" tip opening, even bari and bass sax.  But you 

will find many tenor, bari, and bass sax mouthpieces larger 

than .100".

that number correctly so it would be understood by all. The maker of 
the device said that I should use the read number and it is read in 
thousands.  I think you are about to teach me something and I greatly 
appreciate it.  Steven

            <pre class='message__body'>A picture of your gage might help us sort things out.  Based on the maker&#39;s
info, "20" should be .020".  But this is 1/2 of a normal tip opening on
clarinet.

Try placing your gage on flat glass so it reads zero.  Then slip in some
feeler gages under the probe to see if you get the same reading on your
dial gage.
