Just to be clear, what set of feeler gages are you using?  What are their
thicknesses?  Also is "40110" looks strange and a 20 mm tip opening is too
large to make sense.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

What seems odd is that a shank bore is commonly around 15mm opening.

So a tip opening of 20mm seems unrealistic - I don&#39;t know how a reed 
can vibrate in that curve ? assuming there was enough height to the 
beak.

You should also be able to easily measure it with a generic ruler at 
that point.  How are you measuring it ?

Can you upload a pic, or a link ?

So maybe the tip is 2.0 mm, not 20 mm.  Or maybe the facing length is 20
mm.

Again, what set of feeler gages are you using and what does "40110" represent.

            <pre class='message__body'>At 20mm, it would blow like a cannon because the tip opening would be bigger than the bore of a soprano clarinet.  Hmmm?  It&#39;s 10 times larger than the tip opening on my contrabass clarinet.  Hmmm?  Missing decimal point?

First two figures in this case 40 is the plane lenght

The last three figures 110 is tip aperture in cents of

So that piece it is equivalent to a Vandoren B44 more

It is not very difficult to understand "40110":

The first two figures, in this case 40, is the plane
lenght expressed in half of mm unit i.e. 20mm which is
a medium short plane lenght

The last three figures 110 is tip aperture in cents of
mm.
The only strange thing is the use of half of mm as
measure unit expecially for 1930 american people.

  Place the gauge directly on a piece of glass or other flat surface.  Does it read zero?
   
  Note that you read the gauge BACKWARDS from zero as the probe drops down.

  40110 -- 110 would be 1.10 mm tip opening 
   
  1.1 mm / 25.4 mm/inch = .043" tip opening.
   
  20 mm / 25.4 mm/in = 0.787"  That is more than 3/4 of an inch.  
   
  Even if there is a missing decimal...
   
  2.0 mm / 25.4 = .078"  That is a good alto saxophone tip opening.  I have seen some soprano sax tip openings that large, but I have never seen a clarinet tip opening that large.

we do believe he means the facing length as that flexing reed in his

thus the questions about his measuring ....

This said I feel the need to make a remark. 
If the way of measuring, dealing with materials and how to handle 
them has to be explained and I do mean the very, very basics of 
things (plus a basic common sense) then I feel a little dissapointed.

As an example the discussion below and somewhere was the question of 
filing down a rubber mouthpiece with either a metalfile or a woodfile.

I realise this will be very, very touchy and I also realise that 
there are a lot of absolute beginners (of which I&#39;m one) but in my 
opinion if you have the intension of starting something new you also 
take the responsibility of reading and finding out the basic things 
before you ask things you easily can find out yourself.
I do not have the intension of pushing beginners aside. I will 
encourage them strongly to participate (and keep participating) in

Even 0.02 sounds too small for a clarinet mouthpiece.  Clarinet tip 
openings typically run from about .039" (1.0 mm) to .047" (1.2 mm).  
Of course, there are a few that are smaller, and Jazz/Dixieland 
players that may play as large as .055" (1.4 mm) or larger.  The 
clue is in the 40110 code on the piece.  40 is the facing length in 
half mm&#39;s, so the facing length is 20 mm&#39;s.  The 110 indicated 1.10 
mm tip opening, or .043".

I think the problem you are having is that dial indicators read 
directly when the probe is pushed up into the gauge.  They can be 
adjusted for a zero point by placing the gauge and fixture on a flat 
surface (thick glass, machined metal surface, etc), and drop below 
that to -.200".

When the gauge fixture is placed against the table of the mouthpiece 
(where the reed rests), the probe placed to touch in the middle of 
the tip rail, the gauge reads below that zero point (the plane of 
the mouthpiece&#39;s table).  The gauge must be read in reverse, 
counting back from zero.

So, what must be done is that you place your gauge and fixture (or 
holder) on a flat surface, and move the gauge up and down in the 
fixture until it reads zero with the probe touching the flat 
surface.  As you lift the gauge/fixture from the surface, the probe 
will drop down and give a negative reading, dropping as far as -
.200".

Why .200" and not .100"?  Because you will not find any mouthpiece 
with as much as .200" tip opening, even bari and bass sax.  But you 
will find many tenor, bari, and bass sax mouthpieces larger 
than .100".

Try placing your gage on flat glass so it reads zero.  Then slip in some
feeler gages under the probe to see if you get the same reading on your
dial gage.
