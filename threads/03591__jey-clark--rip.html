            <pre class='message__body'>Jey Clark, owner of Saxology in Berkley, Ca, passed away last night after
suffering a massive stroke on Sunday. I have no other details at this time,
but the information was confirmed this afternoon in a conversation with his
girlfriend. Jey was a long time friend, a frequent visitor to my home,
played his ass off, and made me laugh. I&#39;ll miss him.

hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.

            <pre class='message__body'>Jey was certainly younger than me...I bought several horns from him
when he used to run Four Winds in San Jose, before Starving Musician
bought him out. Also used to run over to his place in Santa Cruz to
get mouthpieces &#39;touched up&#39; and have a good time sampling his
extensive collection! He was always totally cool...sadly, I hadn&#39;t
gotten up to his new store yet since he moved back out here to the
Golden State. scary and sad...
