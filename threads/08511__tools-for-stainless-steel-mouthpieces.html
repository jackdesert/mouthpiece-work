Valtitan needle files hold up longer.  I never found a significantly better way to flatten a SS Berg table.  I tried a sharpening stone for knives.  One of those that is plastic with diamond dust plugs in it.  It held up better than sandpaper but it was still too much work.  I think Dave Speigenthal uses a large flat file to rough in SS tables.  I dont know if the file or the mouthpiece is clamped.

For chamber work, stone grinding points work well in a high speed rotary tool.

This sort of explanation is why you have always been my hero!

 

That being said, I&#39;ve got over a hundred stainless steel mouthpieces (our
Yellow Moon model) in inventory. I am not quite sure what I was thinking
when I ordered the blanks to be made in stainless steel. The prototype I
made was in brass, and after playing it along side production examples I can
hear absolutely no difference. The only difference seems to be the pain in
my hand and the wear on my tools when I tweak them for sale.

 

I understand that Peter Ponzol has switched to stainless steel for his line
of mouthpieces, and I know Peter is a smart guy, so there must be a reason.
Maybe I should call him and ask him about this. I know that Beechler also
produces some steel mouthpieces, and there are certainly others doing so.

 

My motive in offering a stainless steel model was to offer our customers
some diversity, maybe a noble thought, but now somebody (Toby? Mojo?) needs
to convince me that stainless steel has some characteristic which makes it
worth the considerable effort required to put a world class facing on the
blank!

            <pre class='message__body'>Even with the right tools for the job, it takes more than enough determination, resolve and muscle power to work stainless steel.  It is probably not a good idea to try to modify the tip opening any more than about five thousands of an inch.  Take 2 Advil for the headache and hand pain.

For tools, since you asked about files, for any place with access I
would use a micromotor with a suitable. It won&#39;t help with flattening or
for filing deep, but for everything else it&#39;s the best. It&#39;s more
percise than hand files. Someone mentioned a dremel but there is no
comparison, and also no comparison with a flexible shaft tool. The
micromotor has many advantages. It&#39;s a lot more expensive. at least a
good one is, I&#39;ve done a lot of research before choosing mine. I
actaully almost never work on mouhtpiece but it&#39;s one of my most useful
tools for woodwind repairs (most useful after the basic tools).

Advantages of stainless steel, I can&#39;t think of any for the maker. For
the player, it&#39;s the most durable, no corrosion or plating to wear, etc.
Since some play very old hard rubber or even plastic mouthpieces the
extra durability seems unecessary and if anyone is worried about
corrosion etc. then they can use a hard rubber mouthpiece.

I don&#39;t like metal mouthpieces but if I did, I might prefer stainless
steel over brass (even if it was plated).

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the suggestion, Tony....I did a little internet research after I
read your post, and it sounds like this is a product which may very well
help me with my dilemma...I ordered an Eze-Lap brand stone (not too
expensive, I spent more than that on dinner last night!) and after I get it
and try it out I&#39;ll report to the group. 

 

I know that when I switched to diamond faced tone hole cutters for leveling
tone holes it changed my life forever, so this may prove to be a good
product for mouthpiece work. We&#39;ll see!

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I got a diamond sharpening stone from DMT (at the recommendation of someone on
this list) and it works very well for rough table flattening on metal pieces.
They have a two-sided (coarse/smooth) one that looks good. I've improved a few
Bergs just by getting the table flat enough to stop air from leaking at the
back of the window.  
  
Stainless steel definitely takes about 3X more work and muscle than brass. If
a stainless steel piece can be substantially improved by some minor table
flattening and some small adjustments to the curve (like evening the rails or
taking down a high spot), I'll do it. But anything more than that, and I'm
with Paul!

OK, just so no one gets confused here if they are considering buying
something like this:

It sounds like what you have is a flexible shaft tool, not a micromotor.
Something like this
http://www.foredom.com/foundations/store/shopdetail.asp?params=K%2E2230*&#92;
57
&lt;http://www.foredom.com/foundations/store/shopdetail.asp?params=K%2E2230&#92;
*57>

I was talking about a dental micromotor, similar to what dental
technicians use. It is much more percise than a flexible shaft tool. It
is also much more expensive, at least a good one is. It really has many
advantages, for example IMO a brushless motor is important so there are
no brushes to change.

There are many other details that are important, like the quality of the
bearings, sealed motor, the torque (even at slow speed), power, speed,
percision, quick-change collet chuck, comfort of the hand-piece, no
flexible shaft (critical!), sophisticated PSU (with processor) and many
more important things. I researched for hours, days, weeks before buying
mine. In the end I bought a top model from a dental equipment company.

Foredom also has a version of this
http://www.foredom.com/foundations/store/shopdetail.asp?params=K%2E1050*&#92;
104
&lt;http://www.foredom.com/foundations/store/shopdetail.asp?params=K%2E1050&#92;
*104>  however this looks almost identical to the model Handy 701 made
by Korean company Saeyang http://www.saeyang.com/E_sub2_2_1.php
&lt;http://www.saeyang.com/E_sub2_2_1.php>  which is sold for
(significantly) less. I still thought these Korean models are good value
if you don&#39;t want to invest in one made a more reputable Japanese or
German company. I chose a Japanese one.

For mouthpiece I assume the main advantage would be the precision. Sorry
to get a little off topic, but I have to say that for woodwind repairs
the micromotor is my most important and useful tool after the basic
tools such as screwdrivers, some pliers, leak light, filler and a few
other hand tools. I have tried dremels and flexible shaft tools and
there is just no comparison.

Hey Steve,

I have a few Bergs I need opened up. You interested in the job?  [:D]

Hahahahaha...   You bet... and &#39;67 Dodge Darts with slant 6&#39;s.


Seriously, I can do 10-15 rubber or brass mouthpieces in the time it takes to do one SS mouthpiece.  And I&#39;m not making any money on the deal when I consider my time.  If I did charge what the job really takes in time, the customer could not afford my work.  A light touchup of a nick is one thing, but something major like, "I&#39;d like the tip opened up about .0015" " just isn&#39;t going to happen today.  The cost in materials and tools that will have to be used also contributes to this being a money loser.

Can I do the work?  Yes, most certainly.  Is it worth my times and the customer&#39;s money?  No.

In the same way, I dislike working on the very soft "Silverite" Dukoffs.  While a good playing mouthpiece, the material is so soft that just banging around in the case will damage it unless well wrapped.  I&#39;ve carefully flattened the tables, evened the rails, etc, and found that just putting on the glass gauge has scratched the table, and there are little nicks in the facing from checking with the feelers.  I think soft solder is harder than that stuff.  I feel like I have wasted my time working on them.  But I do notice some "Silverite" seems to be harder than other samples.

I like my customers and want to please them, and many can tell you I always do a little extra, not just the minimum work required.  I do good cleaning, polishing, they get back a really nice mouthpiece, both in playing and appearance.  I take pride in my work.

So it is disappointing to me to have to turn down some work, but it is just necessary or I neglect other customers, my family, and myself.

Paul

OK, just so no one gets confused here if they are considering buying
something like this:

It sounds like what you have is a flexible shaft tool, not a micromotor.
Something like this
http://www.foredom.com/foundations/store/shopdetail.asp?params=K%2E2230*57

I was talking about a dental micromotor, similar to what dental technicians
use. It is much more percise than a flexible shaft tool. It is also much
more expensive, at least a good one is. It really has many advantages, for
example IMO a brushless motor is important so there are no brushes to
change. 

There are many other details that are important, like the quality of the
bearings, sealed motor, the torque (even at slow speed), power, speed,
percision, quick-change collet chuck, comfort of the hand-piece, no flexible
shaft (critical!), sophisticated PSU (with processor) and many more
important things. I researched for hours, days, weeks before buying mine. In
the end I bought a top model from a dental equipment company. 

Foredom also has a version of this
http://www.foredom.com/foundations/store/shopdetail.asp?params=K%2E1050*104
however this looks almost identical to the model Handy 701 made by Korean
company Saeyang http://www.saeyang.com/E_sub2_2_1.php which is sold for
(significantly) less. I still thought these Korean models are good value if
you don&#39;t want to invest in one made a more reputable Japanese or German
company. I chose a Japanese one.

For mouthpiece I assume the main advantage would be the precision. Sorry to
get a little off topic, but I have to say that for woodwind repairs the
micromotor is my most important and useful tool after the basic tools such
as screwdrivers, some pliers, leak light, filler and a few other hand tools.
I have tried dremels and flexible shaft tools and there is just no
comparison.
