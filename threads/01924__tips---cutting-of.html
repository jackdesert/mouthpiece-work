Can any of you ladies or gentlemen offer me any suggestions on tools

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a very small half-round file to create a tip rail. I find it important to make sure that there is some "air space" just behind the tip rail, even on a high-baffle piece. I have found that if the baffle rolls over into the tip, as happens when you open a piece up a lot, that the sound tends to be very thin and the reed has a tendency to chirp, as well as feeling unresponsive. I usually start filing a few millimeters behind the tip rail and gradually work my way back to the tip until I have a well defined rail. Be careful--it&#39;s easy to angle the file too obliquely and cut into the rail itself. 

I also find that it is important that the tip rail be flat--so that when the reed is closed against it it is in contact with all parts of the rail. When you are opening up the mpc and making the lay it is very easy to go too far and round the leading edge of the tip rail. 

That&#39;s what I do. Perhaps the pros have some other tips for the tip.

Thanks! Also, the one thing I do is work horizontally
with an angled plastic sheet cutter made by Hyde.  It
is a double sided type, and cuts nicely but maybe I
should go back to the half round file, it might be a
lot better.

            <pre class='message__body'>I used to use a "1/2 round" file, about 1/4" wide tapering to a point, but
now I&#39;m favoring a 1/8" x 1/8" file.  I also use a small pocket knife blade
on the softer materials for fine shaping inside the tip rail.

On point not mentioned is that now that you have a wide tip rail, this is a
good time to shape the end to match the curve of the reed tip.  Also, if
the beak edge is not too pointy you can trim the outside of the tip rail
some more to thicken it up.  This moves the zero point of your facing curve
so you will have to decide if you want to make more facing adjustments or
not.  Sometimes this gets you out of a jam if you overshot your facing
target.  Otherwise you need to cut the table some more or change your target.

I was a little off.  My 1/2 round is actually 3/8" wide and my square 
file is 3/16" x 3/16".

Hi:

Yes, the sqare file can be useful, and I find they are
good and sharp, with a clean angle. By the way, I
cannot seem to find 4" half round files individually. 
Is there a good source for those, as I do not want to
buya kit just to get one.

Thanks for all your help (as always)

            <pre class='message__body'>I buy files from www.micromark.com

They are primarily aimed at model builders, but many of their tools and 
materials are very useful for work on mouthpieces or sax repair.  Order 
the free catalog online.  It is easier than searching the site.

            <pre class='message__body'>Nearly all my files have come from MicroMark.  Their kits of 4-8 files cost
about as much as 1 or 2 individual files.

Item #60526 has 8 files for $14.95.  I use maybe 4 of the shapes.

I also purchased a set of 4 from them that are finer with handles dipped in
red rubber.  That set does not come up on their site.  That is where I got
my square file from.

I have a set of coarse riffler files from them too.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well you can&#39;t use a flat file since the tip rail is curved. AFAIK we&#39;re not talking about actual round files here, but elliptical files. I think the secret is in keeping the file moving during the stroke, and working slowly, without too much pressure.

  You guys all use ROUND files to do this? I cannot get a straight line
  no matter how I try with a round file. It looks like a row of bad
  teeth when I get done - crooked as a Lousiana lawyer...
  Granted this is THE most frustrating part of this art, but still when
  I look at JVW or Johannes work, there has to be something I am
  missing. "What one man can do, another can do" (with tons of practice...)
  What will really fry you is once you get a decent looking tip rail,
  then you go to sand down your file marks and goof the rail with the
  paper!!!
  I am going to experiment with an old fashioned scribe for the tip...
  we&#39;ll see what happens.

Do you use the flat side of the half round file alot
for forming the tip?

I used to.  Since it tapers to a point, you can use a 1/8"-3/16" wide
section of it to define the tip rail.  Sometimes I flipped it over for a
few strokes.

Like I sadi before, now I mostly use a 3/16" wide square file.
