I seem to recall that you bought some files from Otto Frei that you 
liked - perhaps the Valtitans.  Which ones have you tried, and what&#39;s 
your assessment of them?  I&#39;ve been using lots of Micro-Mark files, and 
some others from jewelry suppliers and local hobby stores.  They all 
work fine, but if I could get some that last longer and load up less, 
I&#39;d be interested.  Thanks.

easy to navigate the website. They also have a digital caliper on sale right

that the files we need are the coarsest ones they have - I'm used to trying to
find the finest cut/grit/abrasive when shopping for tools!

Hi Keith

If you heat a steel file sufficiently so that it can be bent, you likely
will have changed the composition of the steel such that it is no longer
sufficiently hard to an effective cutting tool.

You may be able to re-harden it by heating it in a fuel-rich flame and
quenching it in oil. See the section on "carburizing".

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_steel.

I&#39;ve used this method to create a small hard-steel peg that I needed, out of
a piece of common nail (which is pretty soft steel). But I don&#39;t know
whether you can restore a file to sufficient cutting hardness this way.

Regards,

Barry

If you heat & bend, don&#39;t forget to harden and re-temper.

Thanks.  I may go for the "Equalling" file as well - it appears to be just a rectangular flat file.  Does the half-round have a file surface on the flat side?  Their diagram looks like it&#39;s smooth on the flat side and would only file on the round.
