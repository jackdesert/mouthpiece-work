            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------A 7* Link **_tenor_ **piece should measure .105 (they're often not 'on spec',
though). Closing that to .080 would probably be inadvisable, since you'd have
to change the table angle significantly. Probably better to find a mouthpiece
with a tip opening that's closer to what you want. .080 would be a 5, which is
on the smaller end of the usual range for a jazz mouthpiece. If it's alto,
well, that's a whole different story...

            <pre class='message__body'>For alto, .080" is a nice middle of the road tip opening.  For tenor .080" is quite small for professional playing, more in the classical range.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Bill, 

I&#39;m curious where you came up with the .080 facing figure? Did you try out
some other Links?  I think to go from .080 to 1.05 is a big jump, up or
down.

Are you playing a new or an older Link, metal or hard-rubber?

I agree with Dan that you should try other mouthpieces (if possible). Try a
6* Link if you can, which is a .095 facing. Some would suggest that you try
a few, because there is variability in quality.

Personally, I used to play a Link 5, which is a 0.080 facing, which was
re-opened to almost .090, then I went to a Rico Metalite .105. That was too
wide for me; a .095 Metalite was much better, and now I&#39;m still happy on a
.095 facing (Ponzol), altho I find I&#39;m going to slightly harder reeds (from
2 to a 2-1/2 or more.

Closing your Link down somewhat shouldn&#39;t be that difficult, especially if
it&#39;s hard rubber, but it&#39;s not a job for a newbie, because the facing curve
will have to be re-done, which is non-trivial.

It seems to me that if one has the monetary resources, that it&#39;s probably a
good idea to have a matched pair of mouthpieces that one likes. Then a
person can send out one for repairs or alterations, and still have something
to play on in the interim.

BTW, there&#39;s nothing wrong with using a soft reed, if that works well for
you. And if you like the plastic coated reeds, you might like the Fibracell.

-------First I want to thank you for your quick reply,  Barry, Paul 
and Dan.  First, let me say, I have a Yamaha 62 Tenor which I 
purchased about three years ago.  It came with a 4C mouthpiece.  I 
used a Lavoz Number two medium soft reed.  I came across a mayer 
number 7, moved on to a dukoff D#5 metal which worked fairly well for 
me with a plastic coated number 2 reed.  I purchased a number 7* link 
metal
That is where I am now.  Plays well with a rico 1 and 1/2 reed.  All 
indications are I will stay withthe 1 and 1/2 until I work up to the 
plastic coated number 2 reed.  Hoping the chops will get bette.  
Again,thanks for all your help
Bill
