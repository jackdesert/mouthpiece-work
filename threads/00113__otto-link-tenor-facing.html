            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
I wonder if anyone could share the original Otto Link facing curves 
for tenor, let&#39;s say a 6, 7 or 8. I recently found a Florida Link 4* 
that I am planning to open up. Mostly out of curiosity I&#39;d like to 
start (and probably stop) with an original facing curve. Although 
the &#39;part of a circle&#39; facing works very well, I don&#39;t think that it 
is the type of facing curve Otto Link used. I have a Florida 8 that 
plays very well that I could use as a model, but I don&#39;t think it has 
an original facing either. The 4* has a very short facing (21mm). I 
don&#39;t think it is original, though it might be.
From my experiments so far I have learned that the type of facing 
curve makes a big difference in how a mpc responds and sounds. Of 
course the (roll-over) baffle and chamber make an ever bigger 
difference, but I don&#39;t plan to alter these on this particular piece.

BTW I think this forum is a great idea! I have been refacing 
mouthpieces for some years now, but always thought I was more or less 
on my own - apart from the well known professionals of course.

Thanks
Henk

            <pre class='message__body'>This is what I have for a slant sig HR Tone Edge 6 using my set of 
feelers (inches) vs 2*mm gage:

	0.0015	48.5,
	0.0050	41.5,
	0.0095	36,
	0.0165	31,
	0.0245	26,
	0.0330	21,
	0.0485	14,
	0.0650	8,
	0.0790	4,
Tip = 	0.0880	inside tip rail,
	Tip Rail Width	0.041,

My analysis says it is a 6.81 radius curve starting at 55.06.  6.8 @ 
55 is probably close enough.  The last 4 mm (8 on the scale) is 
opened up steeper than a pure radius curve.  The pure radius curve 
would have given a tip opening of .080".  I would like to know if 
this was an .080" blank that was opened to .088" using a lazy man&#39;s 
approach.  The .0015" and .0095" numbers are a little off a pure 
radius too.  48 and 37 would be closer.
