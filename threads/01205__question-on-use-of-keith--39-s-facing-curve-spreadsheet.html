            <pre class='message__body'>Keith (or anyone else who knows),

I&#39;m looking at the facing curve spreadsheet that you have under 
the Files section (FacingCurve.xls), and I have a few questions:

1) R - what does this represent? (The Radius of the curve?)
2) M - not sure what it stands for, but it&#39;s obviously the facing 
length
3) Spec (specification? WHat is this, and what does it represent?)
4) Diff - difference? between what?
5) L Inc - I think I have this one: Length Increment, correct?

Questions on Usage:
"Adjust M until L at Tip = 0".
I&#39;m not sure what M is? Is this spreadsheet to be used for plotting a 
facing that I&#39;ve measured from a mouthpiece, or is it for determining 
the feeler gauge points for a facing curve that I want to apply to a 
mouthpiece?

In other words, let&#39;s say I want a facing length of 50 (on the glass 
gauge, which is 25 mm, correct?), with a tip opening of .110.

How do I use the spreadsheet? I adjusted M until L at Tip was zero 
(Length was 58.2 - seems rather too long)

Then I adjusted R to minimize the Error Sum - 7.33 gives an Error Sum 
of 0 (though I really don&#39;t know what this is).

But now my L at Tip is -6.1. Unless I adjust M again, but then the 
Erro Sum is off again.

Obviously, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. Are there instructions posted 
somewhere? If this has already been covered in an old post, please 
forgive me, and point me in the right direction.

Many Thanks!

-Pete
