Â  
Hi all!

I&#39;ve had a few players recently ask me to lower the baffles on their Links 
(current production). The resulting tone is &#39;pure&#39; (for lack of a better word) 
without that characteristic Link buzz, but it seems there is a point after which 
the natural resistance of a very low baffle design cannot be compensated for by 
the facing curve.

Are there any work-arounds anyone might care to suggest for achieving this 
result tonally without sacrificing projection or adding a significant amount of 
resistance?
