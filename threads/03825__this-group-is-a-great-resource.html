            <pre class='message__body'>Hello Keith et al.

There&#39;s so much great stuff here. It&#39;s a lot to work through! Thanks for
sharing your work and experience.

Until now, mainly I&#39;ve been playing around with chamber and baffle
alterations.

My only 2Â¢ for today: A good buy, perhaps:  a dial indicator, as used in
Guto&#39;s Gage (clever idea!) is only $15.95 at

http://www.sciplus.com/category.cfm?subsection=12&category=131

I bought one, and it works fine.  I use it in a home-made "Perfecta-reed"
device. I haven&#39;t bought any of their other calipers, as I already had one.

I&#39;ve also bought their set of riffler files (item 10955 ) for mouthpiece
chamber work.
