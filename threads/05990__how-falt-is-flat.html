Everybody says flat.  Does anyone know machinists define flat and how
they measure it?

I have a granite stone (from Lee Valley, thanks for the pointer,
group).  It came with a certificate that says it&#39;s flat to a
ten-thousandth of an inch.

How they heck do they establish that?  Certainly not by pointing it at
a light and sighting down it or other handy techniques, I assume.

Somebody edicate me, please!

Thanks,

M.
