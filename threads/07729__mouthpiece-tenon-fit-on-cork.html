            <pre class='message__body'>You can "paint" a layer of epoxy inside the bore of the tenon to make it smaller then sand it smooth.  You usually only need to go .010" smaller in diameter to make a loose mouthpiece fit properly.  

After applying the epoxy, you can coil up a strip cut from a of clear plastic sheet and insert it in the bore.  It will spring out and press the epoxy smooth except for a ridge where the coil first overlaps.  After the epoxy dries, you can sand out this ridge.  Check the diameter in several spots for uniformity with inside caliper measurements.

Is there an easy fix for a mouthpiece to make it fit a cork. It&#39;s an old yamaha mouthpiece that I have refaced and don&#39;t want to recork the mouthpiece or put tape,paper etc on the cork. The mouthpiece is too large.

            <pre class='message__body'>Very clever.

To clarify, though, it sounds like you&#39;re using stiff polyethylene sheet or
other material that won&#39;t stick to the epoxy. Is that correct? If so, what
plastics are suitable?

            <pre class='message__body'>I cut a strip out of some scrap clear plastic.  It is the backing I pull off of the self-adheasive sandpaper that I use for facing work.  It needs to be thin enough to coil and thick enough to spring back.  I could put a micrometer on it but I do not think it is that critical.

            <pre class='message__body'>AN EASY FIX IS TO USE ONE OR MORE COATS OF CLEAR FINGERNAIL POLISH INSIDE OF THE TENON TO MAKE A LOOSE MOUTHPIECE FIT MORE SNUG - JUST PAINT ENOUGH COATS TO MAKE IT FIT WELL.
