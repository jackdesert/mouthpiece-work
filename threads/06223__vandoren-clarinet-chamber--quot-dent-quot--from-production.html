            <pre class='message__body'>I have noticed that in the past few years, VD clarinet mouthpieces
have a n indentation in the "rake" (I refer to the small flat area
that is opposite the baffle).  On older VDs I have never seen this and
on new VDs it appears with amazing variance of size and shape- but it
is always there.
Does anyone know WHY this is there?  Is it a part of the design? or a
factory flaw?
If it is part of the design, what does it do?  Anyone out there try
incorporating it into their pieces?
