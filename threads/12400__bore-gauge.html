            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everyone,

I was looking for bore gauges being sold here in New Zealand when I came across these: http://tradetools.co.nz/products/4830320

Will these be suitable for measuring clarinet bores?

Cheers,

Harim Oh

            <pre class='message__body'>I think so.  You need to use calipers with them.
