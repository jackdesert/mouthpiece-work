            <pre class='message__body'>I corresponded with Jon recently - he indicated that he hasn&#39;t made the video, due to lack of interest! Maybe we should all petition Jon and let him know that there is plently of interest here!!

Subject: MPC tools and supply sources reported so far

What follows is a reiteration of what I think I&#39;ve read here so far.  
The main idea behind my doing this is to be sure I&#39;ve pulled together 
the correct info to begin working with.

Thanks in advance for any feedback, including further clarity or 
details, about this stuff.  I&#39;m not so worried about how accurate the 
supplier info is as I am concerned with and would like feedback about 
the list of tools and supplies I&#39;ve pulled together from all previous 
postings.

Subject: MPC Tools and Supplies

Once again, what follows is a reiteration of what I think I&#39;ve read 
here so far.  The main idea behind my doing this remains my concern 
with being sure I&#39;ve pulled together the correct info to begin 
working with.

No attempt has been made to sort through this stuff and determine 
what items may substitute for others on the list nor have I tried to 
even guess at what might be essential for one person and useless for 
another.  I&#39;m mostly interested in getting somewhat of an idea of 
various, reasonable versus hypothetical, possibilities used by those 
of you currently working with MPCs.

The list is alphabetical and no attempts have been made at 
categorizing things I really don&#39;t know enough about to group 
coherently.  For those who already have good ideas about this 
information, please excuse my naivet√© here.  Any errors or
omissions 
are probably the result of my having been a hippie college student in 
the sixties coupled with being a somewhat retired person and 
beginning sax player these days.

Thanks in advance for any feedback, including further clarity or 
details, about this stuff.

Jon Van Wie&#39;s upcoming refacing video, as listed on his website.

There are other videos about sax maintenance and repairs but Jon&#39;s 
work in progress is the only one about mouthpiece work I&#39;ve 
discovered so far.  And, I&#39;ve not gone through the various instrument 
repair manuals for info either.  I am in the process of starting to 
run down published articles about sax and clarinet mouthpieces and 
will be doing what I can through inter-library loans, at least as 
much as I can afford, depending on what other libraries charge for 
photocopies of articles.  If anybody has suggestions beyond the 
articles appearing in Saxophone, they would be most graciously 
appreciated.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Digest Number 58</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>I wonder how one would determine whether or not there&#39;s a sufficient 
market for selling a refacing video?

For instance, without any editorial comments about quality, etc., one 
fellow sells self-published videos of sax, clarinet, and flute 
overhauls regularly on eBay, among other venues he may use; search 
using keywords "Bird&#39;s Eye View Overhaul".  Another sells a self-
published clarinet, saxophone, and flute repair manual on eBay; 
search using keywords "Clarinet Saxophone Flute Repair Manual".

There are a variety of intermediate, online vendors who do not 
provide direct MPC services but do sell booklets and information, 
such as Gary Van Cott at:  www.vcisinc.com and other sax websites 
which sell a variety of things, such as musicmedic.com and others.

I wonder what sales might be if Jon was to arrange to distribute his 
refacing video to a variety of sources, somewhat as is done with Dr. 
Dan&#39;s maintenance video&#39;s found at his website and a variety of 
others:  http://originalswab.com/vids.htm.  They are for trumpet, 
clarinet, trombone, saxophone, flute, and violin.

And, if Jon put out an email blitz like Bill Singer has on the sax 
discussion groups, among other possibilities, including clarinet 
sites like sneezy, he might generate enough sales to make producing a 
refacing video worth his while.

It seems enough folks are interested in mouthpiece refacing, as 
evidenced by discussions not only here but on various other sax and 
clarinet lists and sites.  It would just be a matter of figuring out 
how to turn that into sales, I guess.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think the market is too small.  But it is getting easier to self-
produce and duplicate booklets and videos.  Perhaps a DVD you could 
duplicate yourself, a few at a time, as needed.

Every sax needs maintenance and abuse repairs.  But everyone does not 
need mouthpiece work.  I think everyone can benefit from it, but it 
is not a neccessity.  If you damage your mouthpiece or need a more 
opne one, you can buy a new one.  How many pro shops are there as 
compared to pro refacers?  The ratio is probably 100 to 1 (or more).  
Among amatures, a few of us tweek mouthpieces and tweek saxes.

            <pre class='message__body'>Viewers may not always be users.  Some of the appeal of a refacing 
video may be to the wide variety of players who may never lift a tool 
but would like to know a little more about refacing.  Sort of an 
informed consumer notion to the same market as a lot of folks who buy 
repair manuals but may not do many on their own.  I guess the 
question would come down to what a decent financial breakeven point 
might be, depending on what the costs of video production could end 
up being.

Your idea of something which could be produced inexpensively and 
delivered upon demand seems like a great notion but then I&#39;m just a 
dreamer and not always that practical with my ideas.  Especially 
since I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right about not a lot of folks are actually 
interested in doing refacing themselves.
