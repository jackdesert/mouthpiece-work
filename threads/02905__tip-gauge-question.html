Those look great.  Now for the really stupid question...what 
increments are those measuring or calibrated to?  Also, will there be 
a sheet explaining its basic use for clueless >me) newbies to mpc 
work?

            <pre class='message__body'>The gauge is in .001 of an inch. Yes I will be putting an instruction sheet
in with the units. I&#39;m also supplying Allen wrenches for assembling and
disassembling. (I&#39;ll be shipping them with the dial indicator removed.)

 

Take care,

 

Steve
