            <pre class='message__body'>The set of diamond files I use for shaping the tiprail is (I believe)
at fault here, but I could be wrong. I have some new files on order,
but was just wondering if anyone else had this problem.

I have tried different shapes as well - small flat, small triangle,
half-round (all using the flat side). The one that seems to work the
best is the wider flat file.
Now I know this takes YEARS of practice to get right... in fact, it
did a Brilhart LA Stainless with them and it came out great. I just
wonder if the combination of diamond files and plastic are causing
this...?

            <pre class='message__body'>Patrick, without a doubt, the baffle/tip rail is the most difficult part 
of mouthpiece work.  I use a file that is flat on one side (and I use 
the flat side) and rounded on the other, and is pointed.  I use the area 
of the file about 1/2" back from the point that is about 1/8" wide or 
so.  I move the file in small circular or oval motion, rather than back 
and forth, which causes it to notch the baffle and make a jagged tip rail.

            <pre class='message__body'>Because it does take a lot of practice, this is why I offered a while 
back the Runyon Model 22 and other pieces... for practice fodder.  Some 
guys bought these and made some good playing pieces from them.

I will bet some guys were quite surprised by the brand names stamped on 
some them.

But I know of no way to learn but by doing, and yes, messing some up.  
If you aren&#39;t willing to crash a few times, you will not learn to fly 
model airplanes, and even pro golfers lose some balls. 

But after a while you will get better, and better.

Oh, keep a "file card" handy (from Ferree&#39;s) and clean the teeth of the 
file often.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Paul,
Thanks for the response and helpful hints as always...
Can I take it from below that you do NOT use diamond files for this?
If not, have you ever? Can&#39;t wait to get my new (regular) files to see
if it helps...

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a set of diamond files that I occassionally use on Stainless 
Steel.  But I have found that they can leave deep scratches that are 
difficult to sand out.  More often, I wrap 220 grit paper around 
files for the SS work.

On non-SS I use med-fine and med-coarse needle files.    Lately, I&#39;ve 
been favoring a 1/8" x 1/8" cross section med-fine file for tip rail 
work.  But the shape Paul describe is a "must have" general purpose 
file.

            <pre class='message__body'>I got my new 3mm files in today and tried them on the plastic mpc&#39;s.
Amazing difference - I might be able to actually do this!!!
Conclusion - use diamond files on metal only. (for me)

I find the bigger flat file works best for me. If I use the tapered
file I get mixed results...

Thanks to all who helped!
