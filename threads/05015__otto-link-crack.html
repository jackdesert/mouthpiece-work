            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Otto Link crack</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>One of the saxophonist of my group has a tenor Florida 7* (no USA on
shank), terrible cond but still playing.

The window has a big crack on the table side... it looks like the
rusty eat the metal on that point... it seems found in a wreck down a
dive spot! 

He ask me if I can do something because he feel soon it will not play
anymore. So I direct to all of you the questions.

My first thinking was to use a dental resin and than make it folded
but there is not 1 mm to work on, so impossible to fill. I mean it&#39;s
so thin that the resin don&#39;t have a point where to hang and resins
don&#39;t glow in anycase. 
My second idea was to make a kind of "naca air flow" as I&#39;ve seen on
the new Jody metal DX, just to stop eventually the crack from move. 
But I&#39;m sure it will change the sound.

Question is some of you have done in the past a kind of job and can
help me with good tips.

Thanks.
Gian

  Hah!  Yes, it has "barnacles" growing inside it!
   
  Here is what I would do...
   
  Place a piece of tape across split.  That is where the two halves of the mouthpiece are soldered together.
   
  Fill in with some epoxy putty using a flat blade screwdriver like a "putty knife".  If you will occasionally dip the blade in water it will not stick to the epoxy and you can mash the epoxy into shape until it begins to harden in a few minutes.
   
  Once it is hard, glue some sandpaper around an old pencil or dowel and sand it smooth.  I would wait a few hours so that the epoxy putty is very hard and will sand better.  It will not fill up the sand paper so bad.
   
  Then remove the tape, and sand the "table" of the mouthpiece (flat place where the reed goes) to remove any bump created by the epoxy.
