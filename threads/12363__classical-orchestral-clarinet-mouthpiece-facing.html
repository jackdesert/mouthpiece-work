            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everyone,
 

 

 I am having trouble with constructing a proper clarinet mouthpiece facing. A clarinet facing is supposed to look like the one on the bottom in the attached file right? The one on the top one is the actual measurements of an mouthpiece of mine, so what I've tried to do on the bottom is to imagine what the top is supposed to look like without the low spots in the facing. Can any expert classical/orchestral clarinet mouthpiece refacers help me out? Is that what the mouthpiece facing originally intended to look like? Have I fixed it? What can I do to make it better?


Cheers,

Hi everyone,

 

 

I am having trouble with constructing a proper clarinet mouthpiece facing. A clarinet facing is supposed to look like the one on the bottom in the attached file right? The one on the top one is the actual measurements of an mouthpiece of mine, so what I&#39;ve tried to do on the bottom is to imagine what the top is supposed to look like without the low spots in the facing. Can any expert classical/orchestral clarinet mouthpiece refacers help me out? Is that what the mouthpiece facing originally intended to look like? Have I fixed it? What can I do to make it better?


Cheers,

Harim

            <pre class='message__body'>This is only true fir some of the Excel graph types.  The XY graphs are the ones to use for plotting facing curves.
