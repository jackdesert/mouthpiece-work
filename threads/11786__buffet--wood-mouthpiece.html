 I'm keeping this piece in sealed tupperware with a 55% humidipak. I read that is a good humidity for keeping clarinets stable and I hope it will work for mouthpieces as well.
 

 I am doing some stability measurements/testing now, but after that I plan to oil it with almond oil. I have read that doing this every 6 to 12 months will help prevent it from taking in moisture and cracking.
 

 Any other info, experiences and opinions would be greatly appreciated.
 

 I can't wait to get this piece opened up to .100 or so. :)

Probably grenadilla. I have a number of original tarogato mpcs which are 
also of wood. I suggest putting a mpc patch on it, as you would be 
surprised how quickly the top teeth will wear away the wood.

I am a woodworker, and I use a lot of cocobolo (rosewood).  It has a very allergic effect on many people.
I know a guy that made some harmonica combs from rosewood, and his lips swoll up.

After years of curiosity, I finally acquired a wooden tenor mouthpiece from eBay. It has no markings, so I&#39;m skeptical about the details provided by the seller, but the price was right and although the tip is too small for me, it plays quite well.

Here is the seller&#39;s description:
"This is a interesting turn of the century wood mouthpiece for tenor saxophone.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had a similar experience when I used camphor laurel for a guitar fretboard. I had a very rapid allergic skin reaction.

            <pre class='message__body'>I wouldn&#39;t consider myself an expert but I agree, it looks like it could be
grenadilla (african blackwood), particularly based on the grain pattern.
I&#39;ve also heard rosewood reported as a sensitizer but I think severe
reactions are probably pretty uncommon.  I had a rosewood mouthpiece made
by Francois Louis in the 1980&#39;s in my possession for some time and no
allergy.

There are several varieties of "rosewood."  I have seen cocobolo used as a
substitute but haven&#39;t heard it classified as rosewood before even though
the genus is the same.  Cocobolo is notoriously allergenic.
