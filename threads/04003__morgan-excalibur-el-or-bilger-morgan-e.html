            <pre class='message__body'>I have two similar alto mp made by Morgan. I&#39; m interested to know
more about this absolute fantastic mp, never tryed before.
The older is a Bilger-Morgan. On the metal ring is still visible a
write Excalibur, s/n 98xx, and 7B, signed by the two.
The new is a Morgan Excalibur 7EL s/n 22xxx.

For sure you guys have a lot of interesting info to give about this
pieces, particulary talking about quality... 
1)the new Morgan&#39;s still are made with high quality hard rubber?
2)Still Ralph finish and check personally any pieces going out of factory?
3)What&#39;s B indicate on the old Bilger (can be an E instead, not clear)?
4)Looking well, all form and inside cut is the same, the difference
are on the chamber size, bigger on EL7 at the base, and the rail are
thiner on EL7, and also the window of EL7 is longer of some mm. This
is due to increase volume or to give a darker tone?
5)I noted Bilger have rails more slanting onto inside than EL7. What
does it means?  

Ahhhh... somebody can give me the email address of Ralph Morgan or
direction or telephon number...? or the way to contact him?

THanks. Gian Luca
