Watch my videos on YouTube.  Also look in the files section on the Yahoo Group site for lists of steps you should follow when refacing.

You can use a wand tip gauge.  I would not consider buying a different one until you get started.   Even then, you may do fine with the wand gauge (or a different gauge won&#39;t help).
