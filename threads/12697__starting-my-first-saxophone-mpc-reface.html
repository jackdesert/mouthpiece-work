            <pre class='message__body'>I only ruined the first mouthpiece that I worked on.  The next 20-30 were passable but probably had slightly convex tables.  I was not really checking for it very well.

Watch my videos on YouTube.  Also look in the files section on the Yahoo Group site for lists of steps you should follow when refacing.

You can use a wand tip gauge.  I would not consider buying a different one until you get started.   Even then, you may do fine with the wand gauge (or a different gauge won&#39;t help).
