Hi All,

I have a Patricola Rosewood clarinet which I totally love. Unfortunately black mouthpieces aren&#39;t the nicest looking mouthpieces in the world so I use either Crystal or clear plastic (Runyon).

My quandary is this. I like Crystal mouthpieces. They seem to have a different tone than the plastic ones however I now own about 5 crystal mouthpieces from a Selmer to Pomarico as well as an antique Marius Fossenkemper made by O&#39;Brien back in the 60&#39;s or so. I don&#39;t think it is a one of a kind. I think it was a line of mouthpieces that O&#39;Brien made under his name.

I have been trying out different openings on the Runyon model 22 Clear plastic ones with their largest opening and they&#39;ve cut open two of them for me that seems to be really close to what I want.

I remember talking via email to some company in south New Jersey about cutting down the Crystal mouthpiece&#39;s for me and they said they can do it. But I can&#39;t for the life of me remember the name of the company.

Can anyone on this group tell me if there are companies that will shave the opening of my crystal mouthpiece for me?

BTW you can see my Patricola at http://www.newjerseywindtrio.com.

Thanks in advance,

Steve

I think any mouthpiece refacer could cut down a crystal (hardness 7) mouthpiece using silicon carbide (hardness 9 - 10) sandpaper and a bit of patience. It cuts just like anything else, though slower.  Care must be taken not to cut too coarse/fast to avoid chipping on the edges.  I&#39;ve cut/polished a lot of stone (same hardness as crystal)  for spatula inlays, rollers, and plate glass for mouthpiece gauges.  Not a big deal I&#39;d think, for anyone here.

            <pre class='message__body'>In response to Sunny (below message):  

You have made some very perceptive observations, however, one can not make valid conclusions about how a saxophone or saxophone mouthpiece works based upon aerodynamics and good common sense reasoning alone.  What is going on is more complicated than that.....but then, not so complicated that it can&#39;t be easily understood, after some non-mathematical study (reading) of the acoustical principles involved.  I suggest reading Benade&#39;s, Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics (particularly the two chapters on woodwinds) for the essentials.  


I&#39;m new to this, but have been doing a fair amount of experimentation
 (mostly with Otto Link STM&#39;s and NY STM&#39;s…) over the last couple years.
  I find this topic fascinating and I think that it could lead to a 
greater understanding of what we empirically know to be true.  (I also 
have been a pilot and student of aerodynamics for many years… still feel
 free to ignore me if I am off base and excuse me if this is redundant 
for some of you pro&#39;s…)
Any of the mouthpiece 
modifications that I have made with a negative impression (no matter how
 small) have been horribly stuffy.  (Maybe not the whole range of the 
horn, but definitely in the bottom stack.)  Flattening this area, 
polishing and/or adding a small round over baffle always improves the 
playability of the MPC, so from my own observations the first 1/4" or so
 must create laminar flow and positive pressure.  Any deviation creates 
drag.  Drag = resistance.  That isn&#39;t to say that you couldn&#39;t add tiny 
indentations throughout this area.  On aircraft wings and golf balls 
this can actually reduce drag by adding a small layer of "air ball 
bearings".  I believe that this is why you can still get a reasonably 
good sounding MPC with a rough looking baffle… as long as the overall 
shape is smooth. 
On a couple of the Links 
there is this indentation beyond the baffle.  Filling this area in keeps
 the air laminar for a longer period of time and allows the air to 
spread into the mouthpiece and reduce pressure at a more constant rate. 
 Again, drag = resistance = not free-blowing.  I had become accustomed 
to the whole Link resistance thing and thought that maybe it was a good 
thing… until I filled in the pond.   I then added a small amount of 
material to another link in this area and as many have found it created 
more projection with basically the same tone.  The length and angle of 
the baffle relates to a mouthpieces ability to be pushed as well as its 
tone.  If you look at a standard Lind STM it has a very short baffle 
that dives off into a pretty big chamber.  It sounds pretty good in a 
small room or when playing at low levels, but when it is pushed really 
hard the air is more likely to stall behind this short and steep area. 
 Stall = Drag = resistance = sorry you just are not going to be heard 
over the brass section…
From an aerodynamic 
perspective it appears that what all of this comes down to is 2 basic 
concepts.  1.  laminar flow.  As far as I can see the more round over 
baffle, the longer the baffle and the more gentle the transition, the 
more free blowing a piece is.  (Although, sometimes this may remove some
 of the dark character and make a mouthpiece too generic or lifeless…) 
 2.  The length and angle of the baffle.  From Bernoulli&#39;s perspective I
 suppose what we are doing is sucking the reed in towards the baffle 
first, then the positive pressure in the mouthpiece and the flex of the 
reed creates a harmonic fluctuation of a certain length along the reed. 
 The shorter and higher baffle would affect more of the tip of the reed 
instead of the full length.  Where I would guess that this would favor 
higher frequencies.  A longer and lower baffle would probably work on a 
greater length of the reed and a broader range of frequencies.  This 
would also make sense as to why some reed combinations do not work.  The
 length of the baffle and angle of the baffle would have to match the 
flexible area of the reed. 

Now 
the final part of the puzzle.  How much MPC does the player take in? 
 Those that practically swallow the MPC (and I wish I were one of those 
people, because their tone can be incredible…) may be both causing the 
airflow to hit the baffle at a slightly different angle and for the reed
 to vibrate more freely.  A friend and I played the same mouthpiece and I
 found it to be fairly bright and a bit resistant.  He on the other hand
 takes in a lot of mouthpiece and his tone was very different.  He just 
seemed to be accessing a different portion of the baffle and reed that I
 was not.

To quote sunny:

“That isn&#39;t to say that you couldn&#39;t add tiny indentations throughout this area.

I believe that this is why you can still get a reasonably good sounding MPC with a rough looking baffle… as long as the overall shape is smooth”

 

I actually acheived this accidentally with my 3d printed mouthpiece (pictures on the mpc work group) where I actually made golfball dimples after the throat because it seemed to me that`s where the air would slow down and I wanted to speed it up again(what I recently learned on the mpc work group and here probably not..) But I cant prove my ideas because the print quality was too rough and the general mpc design (I tried to copy a STM alto) wasnt optimal either. 

 

But! The roughness of the print (ca. 1/64”) in the chamber seemed like it was giving it some other benificial properties. And I wasn`t the only one who experienced this. I had the mpc sent to Marten Postma, a dutch refacer and acoustics enficianado, He did some touching up to the facing and guided me with some general questions about mouthpiece design. He confirmed my experiences and thought that the “ribbed” chamber had the effect of making the air travel less laminar as normal.

 

When I scrape some money together I’ll have one printed that is really smooth, and have it refaced by Marten again, or I’ll copy the facing work so I can compair the 2 and hopefully pinpoint the effects.

 

But for future experiments it maybe intresting to make a baffle with golfball dimples. But I still wonder how mucht the coanda effect on the reed and walls effects the airflow in the first 1/2" or so. Wouldnt the coanda effect cause a likewise effect of creating a more laminar flow so that the faster travelling air can travel easier over this layer of air?

In response to Sunny (below message):  

 

You have made some very perceptive observations, however, one can not make valid conclusions about how a saxophone or saxophone mouthpiece works based upon aerodynamics and good common sense reasoning alone.  What is going on is more complicated than that.....but then, not so complicated that it can&#39;t be easily understood, after some non-mathematical study (reading) of the acoustical principles involved.  I suggest reading Benade&#39;s, Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics (particularly the two chapters on woodwinds) for the essentials.  

 

 

I&#39;m new to this, but have been doing a fair amount of experimentation (mostly with Otto Link STM&#39;s and NY STM&#39;s…) over the last couple years.  I find this topic fascinating and I think that it could lead to a greater understanding of what we empirically know to be true.  (I also have been a pilot and student of aerodynamics for many years… still feel free to ignore me if I am off base and excuse me if this is redundant for some of you pro&#39;s…)

 

Any of the mouthpiece modifications that I have made with a negative impression (no matter how small) have been horribly stuffy.  (Maybe not the whole range of the horn, but definitely in the bottom stack.)  Flattening this area, polishing and/or adding a small round over baffle always improves the playability of the MPC, so from my own observations the first 1/4" or so must create laminar flow and positive pressure.  Any deviation creates drag.  Drag = resistance.  That isn&#39;t to say that you couldn&#39;t add tiny indentations throughout this area.  On aircraft wings and golf balls this can actually reduce drag by adding a small layer of "air ball bearings".  I believe that this is why you can still get a reasonably good sounding MPC with a rough looking baffle… as long as the overall shape is smooth. 

 

On a couple of the Links there is this indentation beyond the baffle.  Filling this area in keeps the air laminar for a longer period of time and allows the air to spread into the mouthpiece and reduce pressure at a more constant rate.  Again, drag = resistance = not free-blowing.  I had become accustomed to the whole Link resistance thing and thought that maybe it was a good thing… until I filled in the pond.   I then added a small amount of material to another link in this area and as many have found it created more projection with basically the same tone.  The length and angle of the baffle relates to a mouthpieces ability to be pushed as well as its tone.  If you look at a standard Lind STM it has a very short baffle that dives off into a pretty big chamber.  It sounds pretty good in a small room or when playing at low levels, but when it is pushed really hard the air is more likely to stall behind this short and steep area.  Stall = Drag = resistance = sorry you just are not going to be heard over the brass section…

 

From an aerodynamic perspective it appears that what all of this comes down to is 2 basic concepts.  1.  laminar flow.  As far as I can see the more round over baffle, the longer the baffle and the more gentle the transition, the more free blowing a piece is.

I’m well aware that aerodynamics play a small part, for me a real interesting part as this is measurable / predictable for me. One could make simulations of what the air does inside the mpc, (acoustics too with the correct software and knowledge) And to gain knowledge on that small part gives a better understanding of whole mouthpiece physics imo.

Golf balls do not make music.  Sax mouthpieces do not fly.   

 

Some aerodynamic concepts do inspire some good mouthpiece design ideas.  Probably more than acoustic concepts have to date.  But aerodynamics plays a smaller part of what is going on.

Any deviation creates drag.  Drag = resistance.  That isn&#39;t to say that you couldn&#39;t add tiny indentations throughout this area.  On aircraft wings and golf balls this can actually reduce drag by adding a small layer of "air ball bearings".  I believe that this is why you can still get a reasonably good sounding MPC with a rough looking baffle… as long as the overall shape is smooth. 

 

On a couple of the Links there is this indentation beyond the baffle.  Filling this area in keeps the air laminar for a longer period of time and allows the air to spread into the mouthpiece and reduce pressure at a more constant rate.  Again, drag = resistance = not free-blowing.  I had become accustomed to the whole Link resistance thing and thought that maybe it was a good thing… until I filled in the pond.   I then added a small amount of material to another link in this area and as many have found it created more projection with basically the same tone.  The length and angle of the baffle relates to a mouthpieces ability to be pushed as well as its tone.  If you look at a standard Lind STM it has a very short baffle that dives off into a pretty big chamber.  It sounds pretty good in a small room or when playing at low levels, but when it is pushed really hard the air is more likely to stall behind this short and steep area.  Stall = Drag = resistance = sorry you just are not going to be heard over the brass section…

 

From an aerodynamic perspective it appears that what all of this comes down to is 2 basic concepts.  1.  laminar flow.  As far as I can see the more round over baffle, the longer the baffle and the more gentle the transition, the more free blowing a piece is.  (Although, sometimes this may remove some of the dark character and make a mouthpiece too generic or lifeless…)  2.  The length and angle of the baffle.  From Bernoulli&#39;s perspective I suppose what we are doing is sucking the reed in towards the baffle first, then the positive pressure in the mouthpiece and the flex of the reed creates a harmonic fluctuation of a certain length along the reed.  The shorter and higher baffle would affect more of the tip of the reed instead of the full length.  Where I would guess that this would favor higher frequencies.  A longer and lower baffle would probably work on a greater length of the reed and a broader range of frequencies.  This would also make sense as to why some reed combinations do not work.  The length of the baffle and angle of the baffle would have to match the flexible area of the reed. 

 

 

Now the final part of the puzzle.  How much MPC does the player take in?  Those that practically swallow the MPC (and I wish I were one of those people, because their tone can be incredible…) may be both causing the airflow to hit the baffle at a slightly different angle and for the reed to vibrate more freely.  A friend and I played the same mouthpiece and I found it to be fairly bright and a bit resistant.  He on the other hand takes in a lot of mouthpiece and his tone was very different.  He just seemed to be accessing a different portion of the baffle and reed that I was not.

I would hesitate to attempt designing a functional airplane based only upon my knowledge of acoustics, even though some of the principles are shared with aerodynamics.  

Supplimentally to what Keith advocates - "... I think very little theoretical science can be applied to making good mouthpieces. You can make more progress using sound empirical testing and observations.",   I have found that, after 35+ years of very successful empirical mouthpiece work used at the professional playing level (The best mouthpieces I ever played were ones that I had altered - to the point that I have essentially never played on a stock anything.), nothing has complimented, refined, and further inspired that work, as gaining a good understanding of the applicable theoretical science behind it.  

IMO, neither the purely empirical nor the purely theoretical approach alone can yield optimal results - indeed, as mastery of anything requires the effortless realization of both the "knowing" and the "doing" aspects of the discipline.  In hindsight, it is very clear to me that every significant mouthpiece development, from A. Sax to the Conn Adjustable, to the  Selmer "Squeeze", to
 Guardala, was based to a great degree upon someone having a sophisticated and thorough understanding of advanced woodwind acoustics, ie, stuff that isn&#39;t in the 101 textbook.  Typically, the complex acoustical explanation is abandoned in favor of a more easily grasp, aerodynamic marketing phrase.

I like the thought: Would you want to fly in a plane designed by an acoustician? 

Fortunately, playing mouthpieces designed with aerodynamic thinking is a lot less risky.

But I cant prove my ideas because the print quality was too rough and the general mpc design (I tried to copy a STM alto) wasnt optimal either.

I had the mpc sent to Marten Postma, a dutch refacer and acoustics enficianado, He did some touching up to the facing and guided me with some general questions about mouthpiece design. He confirmed my experiences and thought that the âribbedâ chamber had the effect of making the air travel less laminar as normal.

But I still wonder how mucht the coanda effect on the reed and walls effects the airflow in the first 1/2" or so. Wouldnt the coanda effect cause a likewise effect of creating a more laminar flow so that the faster travelling air can travel easier over this layer of air?

What is going on is more complicated than that.....but then, not so complicated that it can&#39;t be easily understood, after some non-mathematical study (reading) of the acoustical principles involved.  I suggest reading Benade&#39;s, Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics (particularly the two chapters on woodwinds) for the essentials.

I find this topic fascinating and I think that it could lead to a greater understanding of what we empirically know to be true.  (I also have been a pilot and student of aerodynamics for many yearsâ¦ still feel free to ignore me if I am off base and excuse me if this is redundant for some of you pro&#39;sâ¦)

(Maybe not the whole range of the horn, but definitely in the bottom stack.)  Flattening this area, polishing and/or adding a small round over baffle always improves the playability of the MPC, so from my own observations the first 1/4" or so must create laminar flow and positive pressure.  Any deviation creates drag.  Drag = resistance.  That isn&#39;t to say that you couldn&#39;t add tiny indentations throughout this area.  On aircraft wings and golf balls this can actually reduce drag by adding a small layer of "air ball bearings".  I believe that this is why you can still get a reasonably good sounding MPC with a rough looking baffleâ¦ as long as the overall shape is smooth.

Filling this area in keeps the air laminar for a longer period of time and allows the air to spread into the mouthpiece and reduce pressure at a more constant rate.  Again, drag = resistance = not free-blowing.  I had become accustomed to the whole Link resistance thing and thought that maybe it was a good thingâ¦ until I filled in the pond.   I then added a small amount of material to another link in this area and as many have found it created more projection with basically the same tone.  The length and angle of the baffle relates to a mouthpieces ability to be pushed as well as its tone.  If you look at a standard Lind STM it has a very short baffle that dives off into a pretty big chamber.  It sounds pretty good in a small room or when playing at low levels, but when it is pushed really hard the air is more likely to stall behind this short and steep area.  Stall = Drag = resistance = sorry you just are not going to be heard over the brass sectionâ¦

As far as I can see the more round over baffle, the longer the baffle and the more gentle the transition, the more free blowing a piece is.  (Although, sometimes this may remove some of the dark character and make a mouthpiece too generic or lifelessâ¦)  2.  The length and angle of the baffle.  From Bernoulli&#39;s perspective I suppose what we are doing is sucking the reed in towards the baffle first, then the positive pressure in the mouthpiece and the flex of the reed creates a harmonic fluctuation of a certain length along the reed.  The shorter and higher baffle would affect more of the tip of the reed instead of the full length.  Where I would guess that this would favor higher frequencies.  A longer and lower baffle would probably work on a greater length of the reed and a broader range of frequencies.  This would also make sense as to why some reed combinations do not work.  The length of the baffle and angle of the baffle would have to match the flexible area of the reed.

Those that practically swallow the MPC (and I wish I were one of those people, because their tone can be incredibleâ¦) may be both causing the airflow to hit the baffle at a slightly different angle and for the reed to vibrate more freely.  A friend and I played the same mouthpiece and I found it to be fairly bright and a bit resistant.  He on the other hand takes in a lot of mouthpiece and his tone was very different.  He just seemed to be accessing a different portion of the baffle and reed that I was not.

            <pre class='message__body'>A mouthpiece is not a wind tunnel.  A saxophone/clarinet functions due 
to oscillating air, rather than due to a steady flow of air.  Oscillating systems involve two properties of matter - inertia (air mass) and elasticity (air compliance).  Despite what superficially may seem to be obvious aerodynamic, air flow design considerations, the shape and configuration of mouthpiece chambers, throats, side walls, baffles, etc., are in fact primarily determined by the  oscillatory system&#39;s requirements for the distribution of air mass and air compliance in relation to the reed - ie., to maximize the efficiency of the mouthpiece&#39;s internal air pressure changes directly under the reed.

No matter how much air you can blow into the mouthpiece, at any speed, if the air pressure changes caused by the sound wave returning to the mouthpiece from the bell/open tone hole don&#39;t move the reed with the right efficiency, you&#39;ll either get just the hiss of air, or the reed will close and stay closed.  That efficiency determines everything about the mouthpiece&#39;s sound/response qualities.
