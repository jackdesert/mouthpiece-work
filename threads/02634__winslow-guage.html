As far as I know, it is only sold as part of the Winslow kit.

Thanks in advance

The kit is made by Madison Enterprises in Madison, Wisconsin.  I have 
an old number as (608)241-1124.

They seem to have an unusual, reclusive marketing strategy.  They may 
not welcome direct contact, though this number was printed on 
literature from them that came with the kit.  WW&BW used to sell the 
Winslow kit but it was frequently out of stock.

Thank You Keith.

I contacted Winslow by phone about a year ago to make inquiries about 
the gauge.

I got him in person on the phone, and he seemed to be taken aback at 
the request. I asked him if he could come up with a price for me and 
let me know. I never heard from him again.

            <pre class='message__body'>Way back, I once called them to get a bar sax mouthpiece cap to fit over a

But I have heard of many unusual customer-service stories.

As far as I have been able to determine, Madison Enterprises may very
well be defunct.

These people ARE kind of bizarre.  You have to be
quite direct in terms of what you want.

On a related issue, I emailed Theo, and he mailed back
quickly.  He has not seen any of the posts on the
Mouthpiece Work@yahoo site, but said he will check
them out.

This was my exact experience as well and I even told them Paul sent me. I 
wouldn&#39;t hold my breath waiting for one of these.

** Maybe one of you fine fellows that already has one would take it to a 
machine shop and have them make a few up. All that is needed is a machined 
piece of aluminum, depth gauges are available from all sorts of places.***

The profit part is hard...my experience with the feeler gauges is that
I can barely charge enough to cover my time at much less than I get
per hour for repair (and $5 certainly doesn&#39;t cover packaging and the
occasional hour to pack and run off to the post office). It takes time
to make a precision product. I know a local who does very fine etched
glass art work, and might do some gauges, but it&#39;s hard to imagine
beating the $20 price of the Babbitt gauges. I do much better with the
entrepeneur things I do for wealthy people (this class includes very
few musicians).
