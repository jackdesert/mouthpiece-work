The kit is made by Madison Enterprises in Madison, Wisconsin.  I have 
an old number as (608)241-1124.

They seem to have an unusual, reclusive marketing strategy.  They may 
not welcome direct contact, though this number was printed on 
literature from them that came with the kit.  WW&BW used to sell the 
Winslow kit but it was frequently out of stock.

I contacted Winslow by phone about a year ago to make inquiries about 
the gauge.

I got him in person on the phone, and he seemed to be taken aback at 
the request. I asked him if he could come up with a price for me and 
let me know. I never heard from him again.

These people ARE kind of bizarre.  You have to be
quite direct in terms of what you want.

On a related issue, I emailed Theo, and he mailed back
quickly.  He has not seen any of the posts on the
Mouthpiece Work@yahoo site, but said he will check
them out.

This was my exact experience as well and I even told them Paul sent me. I 
wouldn&#39;t hold my breath waiting for one of these.

** Maybe one of you fine fellows that already has one would take it to a 
machine shop and have them make a few up. All that is needed is a machined 
piece of aluminum, depth gauges are available from all sorts of places.***

The profit part is hard...my experience with the feeler gauges is that
I can barely charge enough to cover my time at much less than I get
per hour for repair (and $5 certainly doesn&#39;t cover packaging and the
occasional hour to pack and run off to the post office). It takes time
to make a precision product. I know a local who does very fine etched
glass art work, and might do some gauges, but it&#39;s hard to imagine
beating the $20 price of the Babbitt gauges. I do much better with the
entrepeneur things I do for wealthy people (this class includes very
few musicians).
