            <pre class='message__body'>Many saxophonist and clarinet players unwittingly alter the facing of 
their mouthpieces slowly over time by forcing a mouthpiece with the 
reed and ligature onto the neck cork or into a barrel receiver. 
Twisting the mouthpiece into position or forcing it onto an ungreased 
cork eventually could wear the table or rails. It is probably best to 
attach the reed and ligature while the mouthpiece is in place on the 
neck cork or in the clarinet barrel. Maybe we should keep quiet on 
this, it could mean more work...just kidding!!!!!

  I have often recommended placing the mouthpiece on the neck or barrel first.  This gives a "handle" to hold the mouthpiece, and the reed and ligature are not misaligned when adjusting the mouthpiece.  The student will quickly learn the angle and position of the mouthpiece on the cork.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have recently noticed another "wear" phenomenon in vintage metal Links
with thin material under the table.  There is often 1-2 low spots in the
table just below the window "U".  The material is very thin here.  I think
years of clamping the reed on or (more likely) ligature clamping during
storage has created these low spots.  They usually clean up after a few
strokes.  But they can be bad enough to leak air.

            <pre class='message__body'>Besides the obvious proper technique and taught care of handling a
metal ligature, a soft ligature would largely solve the issue you
bring up.
