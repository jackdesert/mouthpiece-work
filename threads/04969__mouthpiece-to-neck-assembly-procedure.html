            <pre class='message__body'>I have recently noticed another "wear" phenomenon in vintage metal Links
with thin material under the table.  There is often 1-2 low spots in the
table just below the window "U".  The material is very thin here.  I think
years of clamping the reed on or (more likely) ligature clamping during
storage has created these low spots.  They usually clean up after a few
strokes.  But they can be bad enough to leak air.

  I think you are correct.

  I have often recommended placing the mouthpiece on the neck or barrel first.  This gives a "handle" to hold the mouthpiece, and the reed and ligature are not misaligned when adjusting the mouthpiece.  The student will quickly learn the angle and position of the mouthpiece on the cork.
