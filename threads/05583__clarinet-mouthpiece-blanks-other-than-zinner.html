            <pre class='message__body'>I would like to get some other blanks besides the ones zinner
provides. Personally, I don&#39;t like the way mouthpieces made from
zinner blanks play, but I do like the ones from Vandoren or other
vintage mouthpieces that I have done. I am not a beginner and am not
interested in experimenting with junky mouthpieces. I have heard of
Babbitt blanks but have no idea where to get them. By the way, where
do people get those clear plastic blanks? Ideas?
