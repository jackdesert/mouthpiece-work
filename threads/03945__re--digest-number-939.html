new breakthrough that will astound the Sarrusophone community?

            <pre class='message__body'>A friend here in the Great Northwest has compiled a complete 
collection of sarrusophones from little to big.  (Not sure if they are 
the -est of either end of the spectrum, every time I think things 
can&#39;t get bigger or smaller someone always shows me something -er.)

I helped him find reeds for the contrabass sarrusophone, they were 
imported by then D&#39;Addario from the European Vandoren.  Maybe the new 
Vandoren people can get the reeds if anyone should need...

In the meantime, anyone have a lead on an oboe single reed mouthpiece?

Thanks,

Fritz

            <pre class='message__body'>Not really.  Paul Cohen has a Conn mouthpiece that he uses with his 
Contrabass Sarrusophone.  And a fellow I am working with on this project 
has an apparently hand made mouthpiece that was made for a friend&#39;s cbs 
Sarrusophone.   Runyon Products makes (and has for years) a single reed 
mouthpiece for bassoon (uses standard clarinet reed).  And Jack Linton 
made a tiny silver mouthpiece for oboe.  This is not uncharted territory.
