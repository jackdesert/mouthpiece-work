            <pre class='message__body'>Another newbie onboard here. I will be prowling the forums files and postings for much info.

For the last few months I have struggled with coming up with my own mouthpiece. And finally yesterday came up with the right combo to get three different kinds of tones. The one wanted was that low down deep tone.  

Now I find there is a forum out there to help people along this path.

EXCELLENT !


End goal is to place it on a piece of bamboo or PVC and come up with a bamboo/sax.
Another interest, is the making of a Duduk.

Thanks for letting me on board.

Hello to the list.  I&#39;m not sure if I will have any luck in this endeavor, but I thought if anywhere would be a good place to start, some of the lists I&#39;m a member of would be the best places, with the wide knowledge and broad range of careers everyone is in.  
 
 In July 2008, I suffered a severe hemrrhagic stroke which has left me unable to use my left hand/arm at all. In early 2009 I found a group headed by a saxophone professor in a similar situation as myself founded to try to get adapted instruments into the hands of disabled musician like me.  the goups is called the One-handed winds project(onehandwinds.unk.edu)
This saxophone rofessor helped develope a  mechanism to allow the sax to be played with only the right hand.  unfortunately, there are, to my knowledge, only two such instruments in existence.; the one he plays and one on loan to a saxophone student mentioned on the project&#39;s page.  Last Spring, the founder was kind enough to let me try a modified recorder by Marten Visser.  after a month of struggling with the mechanism and fingering chart, I was unable to even play simple scales with any accuracy and returned the instrument before my year-long rental contract began.  In contacting him again to see if there had been any progress in making more saxophones available, He informed me that the builder gave him an estimate of $40,000 to build another.  In contacting the builder myself to see what the bare minimum to get work started, if I were to donate my alto sax to be converted, he told me it would be about $15,000 to do all the work needed to convert an instrument to the one-handed machanism, and that the $40,000 estimate was a prototyping estimate for applying the mechanism to another instrument.  
 I&#39;m curious if anyone knows of any grants or organisations devoted to helping disabled musicians or persons with disabilities that would be able to help with the cost of  having my saxophone converted to the one-handed mechanism.

Hmm.. strange... somehow it appears much of my original post didn&#39;t make it... seemingly formattin problem or something.. but yes.. the One-handed winds project you linked was the project I mentioned in my post.  
Unfortunately, David said there has not been any progress in getting another saxophone produced for the project, due to the cost involved in all the alterations required ( moving the tone holes on the bell to the left side 
of the horn to make room for the toggle keys.  I want to have my sax fitted with the mechanism because as it is I have a good 40+ hours a week wasted doing nothing when I could be *practicing*!!

Yes, I&#39;ve not seen the mechanism in person, there is also a youtube 
video of David playing the instrument in recital. It is aazing the 
amount of technique capable on a one-handed instrument.

When I first looked at the PDF I thought the instrument must rquire 
countless hours of memorizing finger patterns, but upon looking at the 
fingering chart, I can see patterns that mirror  fingerings on a 
traditional saxophone and would make being able to play music at sight 
easier than I initially thought.
