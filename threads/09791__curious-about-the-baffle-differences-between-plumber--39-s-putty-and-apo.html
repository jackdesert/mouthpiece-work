            <pre class='message__body'>Hey all,

I&#39;d like to experiment with extending the roll over baffle (and thereby filling the "lake") in a HR Link that I have. Right now it is a really short medium-height roll over baffle and I&#39;d like to extend it to twice it&#39;s current length to more smoothly transition down into the floor and hopefully add a little projection too, which seems to be lacking in its current state. I got the chance to play on one of the new "Early Babbit Remakes" they had at a demo booth recently, and it played great! A really nice mpc. It had a roll over baffle that was probably around twice the length of the one in my standard HR Link, and it was a little more pronounced of a baffle as well, and I really liked it. I want to try and add a little material to my own HR Link to try and copy the baffle style of that "EB Remake" mpc a little bit to see what it would turn out like.

I&#39;ve noticed that people seem to either use a plumber&#39;s putty type of epoxy for adding baffles, or sometimes I&#39;ve noticed that Mojo uses Apoxie Sculpt for his baffles in HR mpcs. I do like the fact that you&#39;d have a lot more working time with the Apoxie Sculpt before it fully hardens, but right now I have some black colored plumber&#39;s epoxy putty on hand and figure I might just give that a shot this weekend instead. Any reason I shouldn&#39;t use this stuff? It is pretty normal plumber&#39;s putty epoxy, the "Rectorseal" brand from Home Depot, which is supposed to set in several minutes and cure within an hour. 

Thanks for the advice. 

Matt

Hey all,

I&#39;d like to experiment with extending the roll over baffle (and thereby filling 
the "lake") in a HR Link that I have. Right now it is a really short 
medium-height roll over baffle and I&#39;d like to extend it to twice it&#39;s current 
length to more smoothly transition down into the floor and hopefully add a 
little projection too, which seems to be lacking in its current state. I got the 
chance to play on one of the new "Early Babbit Remakes" they had at a demo booth 
recently, and it played great! A really nice mpc. It had a roll over baffle that 
was probably around twice the length of the one in my standard HR Link, and it 
was a little more pronounced of a baffle as well, and I really liked it. I want 
to try and add a little material to my own HR Link to try and copy the baffle 
style of that "EB Remake" mpc a little bit to see what it would turn out like.

I&#39;ve noticed that people seem to either use a plumber&#39;s putty type of epoxy for 
adding baffles, or sometimes I&#39;ve noticed that Mojo uses Apoxie Sculpt for his 
baffles in HR mpcs. I do like the fact that you&#39;d have a lot more working time 
with the Apoxie Sculpt before it fully hardens, but right now I have some black 
colored plumber&#39;s epoxy putty on hand and figure I might just give that a shot 
this weekend instead. Any reason I shouldn&#39;t use this stuff? It is pretty normal 
plumber&#39;s putty epoxy, the "Rectorseal" brand from Home Depot, which is supposed 
to set in several minutes and cure within an hour. 


Thanks for the advice.
