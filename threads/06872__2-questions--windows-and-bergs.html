            <pre class='message__body'>My first question is what does it mean to "undercut" the window?  My second question is about a Berg i have.  It is a 105/2 M.

Take a look at the Wyman paper.  It is a large pdf file on the Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site.

See the dicussion around fig. 46 and fig. 60.  "W:C" in fig. 46 is "undercutting".

Discussion on fig. 45 talks about lengthening the window a little.
