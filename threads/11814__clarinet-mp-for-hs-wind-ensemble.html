 My daughters are in the high school honors wind ensemble. They both are playing a Buffet E11 clarinet. I am looking for a facing curve that would give them a nice full orchestra sound. I am new to refacing and will be using some old mps to start out. Thank you in advance!

            <pre class='message__body'>I would suggest posting measurements of their current mouthpiece facing curves here.  This would show us what feelers you are using and what they are using now.   If they measure decent , I do not think you will hear much difference from a new mouthpiece.  

Do you play sax or clarinet?

            <pre class='message__body'>I will have them bring home their MP this week for a measurement. The 3 of us play sax and clarinet. I am just trying to get a better sound for their clarinet. Measurements to follow. FYI. .. their marching band competes near you a few times this year in Deptford. They play alto and tenor sax in that band. Thanks!</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>Start by scrapping the stock Buffet mouthpieces. Or using them for facing practice. They are nothing special, just space fillers in the case so they are selling a complete unit.

If you have to mic a saxophone, the rest of the band is TOO LOUD!

Great advise! I don&#39;t think they have those stock mps. What mp would you recomend, keeping my budget x2 down?

Hard rubber quality at a student price.

            <pre class='message__body'>A good private teacher will likely have a box full of mouthpieces to try out. So will larger music stores. I am currently playing a Portnoy BP02. For hard rubber mouthpieces they are quite reasonably priced.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree that the Fobes "Debut" is an amazing mpc for the price.  I have a few of Clark Fobes' pro models and like them all.  For a fraction of the price, the "Debut" works almost as well! (for the record, I'm talking about the clarinet mpcs, not the sax ones)  I have heard several GREAT high school clarinet players play on them too.</pre>
