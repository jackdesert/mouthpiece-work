            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your fast reply. 
I confirm that I need to add some material on the internal side of the (side) rail (about <1mm missing).
Can you pls define the best solder type for this work? ( I use solder and soldering guns for my electronics so no problem to find the tools/material)
Then how to apply the solder?
Any mouthpiece preparation required? (Pre-heat, or sand it at the point to better bond with solder?)
Do not know how to attach photo/i will try though.

            <pre class='message__body'>Those repairs are rare so your guess will be as god as mine. I did some and
it seem the regular solder I had with the gun was doing just fine. Make
sense to clean it before applying the solder. Preheating the mouthpiece

Just for testing not to risk ruining it :D

Any other advice? Or any one else?

Plumbers solder doesn&#39;t contain lead anymore. 

Since the Safe
Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986 the use of lead-containing solders
in potable water systems has effectively been banned nationwide. The
major impact of the Act has been on solder containing 50% tin and 50%
lead (50-50), until then the most widely used solder for drinking water
systems. 

Lead-base solders have been replaced by tin-antimony and
tin-silver solders. The main differences between these solders and 50-50
are that they are stronger and require somewhat higher working
temperatures. Many plumbers in the United States have used them in
copper plumbing systems for decades 

The composition of Silverite has
been discussed before (was it Pewter?), but I don&#39;t recall what it is,
or its melting point.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks...I guess that clears that up..

There must be an alternative, however, to practically &#39;sucking on&#39; solder
in the mouth.
It may be safe for plumbing...but there&#39;s a big difference between it being
in your mouth and present in the joins in your plumbing.

If there isn&#39;t, that&#39;s OK.

Now wer&#39;re getting somewhere: Surely it would be better to melt / weld some
pewter (very low melting point) into the damaged area?

(if indeed silverite = pewter).

This may have been discussed elsewhere, but I&#39;m new to the group and I
haven&#39;t finished reading the last ten years&#39; posts....forgive me.

            <pre class='message__body'>That could work, Steve, but you may have bonding issues between the two
different materials.

Also, it may &#39;stand out&#39; a bit when you&#39;ve finished the repair, no?

            <pre class='message__body'>Solder?  Absolutely NOT!  Sorry.  Soft" Solder is 60%-40% or 50%-50% Lead and Tin.  Lead is poisonous.

"Hard" solder has a small percentage of silver added to make it melt at higher temperature, and it is somewhat stronger.  It is used in making jewelry.

In any event, solder containing lead should not be used.  If solder is to be used to repair the Dukoff then use lead-free plumber's solder.  This may be 95% Tin and 5% Antimony. 450°F - 464°F melting range, or a 
copper, bismuth, tin and silver alloy with a 420°F - 460°F melting range.
You will never get the mouthpiece hot enough to adhere solder with a soldering iron or soldering gun.  Likely you would melt the mouthpiece first.  Same with a torch.  I suspect that the "Silverite" material is actually plumber's solder.  

You will have more success with epoxy, as Steve suggested.

            <pre class='message__body'>Bonding is the issue (as I see it).  I would replace the rail with wax, leaving it proud.  Make an RTV mold of the area (or the whole piece), then aim the sprue at the repair.
Boil the wax away, and replace the piece in the mold.  heat the whole mess in a toaster oven at 350 for an hour, then shoot the flask with Britannia (Brit Metal) or other lead free pewter.

http://muggyweld.com/
has solder that will handle the repair, but call them to find out if it is mouth safe...

How much does a silverite Dukoff cost nowadays anyway (to compare time
spent + materials + thinking time + group discussion time etc.....?

            <pre class='message__body'> 

If one had an extremely accurate way of heating the mouthpiece past
the melting point of unleaded solder, without melting the mouthpiece, I
could see using that method. A small ACCURATE temperature controlled
electric furnace would do, I suppose, like people use for enameling. Be
a shame to turn a mouthpiece into a puddle... 

Epoxy seems the easiest
way, and least likely to damage the mouthpiece. 

Once the epoxy has
reacted/polymerized, there&#39;s probably not much in the way of anything
that will dissolve out. 

For hardness and strength, JB Weld is mighty
tough stuff. 

Moreover, since gianniveloce needs to add material to the
internal side of the rail, that area can be roughened, and there&#39;s a
larger area for good adherence.

shank was melting away doing it so I had to be careful to add more material

epoxy would be a easier and better solution.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you have access to a kiln, you can make partial molds (rough/oversized) of the inner and outer surfaces with terra cotta, dry and bisque fire, adjust to fit (sand), then wire/wedge in place.  If you heat the area very gently (slowly) with a small torch flame, the clay won&#39;t crack.  You an melt the damaged area and fill as needed with solder.  Let cool and refinish the surfaces.  

That&#39;s more trouble than an old Dukoff may be worth though, but if done well, there will be no sign of repair.

Well....what&#39;s a vintage mouthpiece worth?
The modern version costs £180 in London...(less than $2.00 change from
$300.00), and that&#39;s before postage,
what&#39;s it cost in Louisiana?

Even if he ends up paying $200 (at most) for the repair, having saved a
vintage mouthpiece *and* $100.00 ain&#39;t a bad deal.

few seconds of electricity, then finishing - easier/neater than epoxy. A
welder with nothing to do might do it for $50.00. Some just sit around welding
tin foil for the fun of it. On Monday, February 24, 2014 4:47 PM, STEVE

Repair a Dukoff? Dear Experts Thank you for the many and enlighting answers. I
have understood that epoxy is the mostly prefered repair material. Not sure if
I find the specific brand/type in Europe though. And how to apply. I am
thinking to create first a sort of "mold" by some material not affected by the
epoxy and the place the epoxy. But what material? Any hint on this? About the
MP. it is a vintage Dukoff Miami Large Chamber. Do not know details was an
Ebay item some years ago and not played so much as I was amateur then, It
chirped a lot (and still is but my control is forgiving now) and my guess is
that the rail problem contributes to it (beside the native characteristics of
Dukoffs...). Does anyone know how much is the market price of this MP today
and where (if) can be bounght? many thanks GV * * * Netscape. Just the Net You
Need.

Looks like a cool technique (I watched some youtube videos, both of
micro and macro). 

OTOH, from what I read elsewhere, it sounds like
mastering it as a skill is non-trivial, compared to applying some
JB-Weld and and then filing etc. Do you care to comment on your learning
curve? 

BTW, for a mouthpiece repair, I don&#39;t think JB-Weld would be
"temporary" unless no steps were taken to ensure adequate adhesion.


How about some numbers on the initial outlay for equipment. 

What
welding wire would you use to add to a rail on Silverite? 

Are you
using it in your other saxophone modifications? Any pix online?

Seems my post triggered interesting discussions. Glad for this.
Actually I have access to welding equipment and looks a promising alternative.
I would like to ask you all a favour: If anyone (preferably in Europe) has any 'scratch' silverite Dukoff to send me to practice before attemting on my own MP. 
Still remember the first motherboard repair that sent it to R.I.P...
Of course I will pay the shipping cost and report back my experience to the group.

            <pre class='message__body'>Barry/GV, 

If I was not into fine metalwork at all, I would most likely use epoxy and be satisfied with the functional results, but for those who are serious about the art of working with metal, that just won&#39;t do.  Being able to take pride in the results is worth the extra effort.  Anything less than a metal based solution would be temporary, since it would be a mistake and have to be redone correctly. Different strokes.

Advances in inverter technology have sent the prices for TIG welders plummeting.  One wouldn&#39;t consider the expense for the occasional mouthpiece repair alone certainly, but for anyone who works with metal fabrication at all, it is such an invaluable/flexible tool, that price is not really an issue.  The steepness of the learning curve is inversely proportional to the amount of interest + aptitude for hand work.  Like refacing mouthpieces, it takes a certain amount of knowledge and practice.  The more you do it, the better you will be.  The attached pict shows a mouthpiece cap I make, welding .024" stainless steel sheet.

Repairing a pewter rail would use a pulsed, low amp setting and the thinnest tungsten possible, sharpened and polished - just enough localized power to create a tiny puddle of molten metal.  Then you add briefly, the end of an equally thin strip of pewter filler into that puddle, and move that sequence across the area to be filled, layer after layer, until done - very similar to what a 3D printer does.  

I would buy thin pewter sheet to cut into wire-thin filler pieces, and some rail thick pieces to practice on - available from various suppliers.

 Just at Ace Hardware, there are about 32 types of solder available, plus the varieties available from Ferree's and Allied. You can get solders in different melting temps; no lead mixes vary from the tin/antimony "soft solder" to the silver " hard solder" for brazing and a varieties in between. I have some "low temp hard solder" for multi step key making. Figure that name out. You would need to know the melting point of the mouthpiece metal and pick a solder that melts first. Then pick a flux that is good for the solder and the metal.

 The 50/50 or 60/40 solders with lead are for arts, crafts, hobby and instrument repair where the user will not come into prolonged or extensive contact with the lead. I am surprised the EPA still lets us get it. If I remember right, in the late 80's and early 90's, lead solder was hard to find except in little packs of rosin core at Radio Shack.
 

 All that said, the epoxy, J B weld, is used on engine blocks. I have had it holding together a heater control lever to a shaft (that runs an air conditioning flap) in a car for decades. If you have a clean surface, it is NOT a temporary, easy way out. Strength and durability are not issues here. If you do not like the idea of a automotive product in your mouth, use the drinking water safe epoxy and ignore the white color.
 

 I have never had something welded that did not warp at least a bit. You could end up with the rail fixed, but the mouthpiece all crooked. Good luck if you try it.

There are a few companies that market specialized welders like this one, which automate the tungsten movement, for use with a microscope.  You can imagine what they cost. They are overkill for repairing a Dukoff.  A good, Miller, Everlast, etc., pulse TIG will spot weld at 1 amp, with .1 sec duration, or pulse at 1hz to 500hz with precise control over the duration of peak arc time - 1% - 99% of each pulse, and you have hand control over tungsten location/angle/movement, amount and feed of filler, and foot pedal control over the end amperage/heat/trigger.  Some imports are &lt; $1000.

I&#39;m not suggesting that you go out an buy one, rather, find someone who has one and knows how to use it, and see if they are willing to do some tests on scrap pewter, to get a feel for it and the required settings.  If you are interested in diving in yourself, you&#39;ll have to learn all about and practice normal TIG welding of steel/aluminum/stainless, welding tips, heat sinks, etc., before you can hope to have any success with pewter.

            <pre class='message__body'>Was finally able to take a few minutes to mess around with this today.  I took a Dukoff wall thin piece of lead and was able to easily fuse thin wire solder to it and build up the surface, without the lead melting away or deforming at all.  Much faster and neater than trying to do it with a torch or iron.  All kinds of  DC settings worked - spot, pulse, and normal, low (&lt;5) amp combinations.  At 2 amps I had to beg the lead to melt.  Wonderful.  I&#39;m throwing my soldering iron away.  Should be just as easy with pewter filler.  Good-by epoxy.

So, your nearest DIY metal fabricator should be able to do this for you in 10 minutes, if he has half a brain - or, get a half decent welder yourself and start having fun.

I&#39;m not suggesting that you go out an buy one, rather, find someone who has one and knows how to use it, and see if they are willing to do some tests on scrap pewter, to get a feel for it and the required settings.  If you are interested in diving in yourself, you&#39;ll have to learn all about and practice normal TIG welding of steel/aluminum/stainless, welding tips, heat sinks, etc., before you can hope to have any success with pewter.

Did you say you use this?
How much do they cost?

Does it acutally &#39;weld&#39; or &#39;solder&#39; (in the case of the mouthpiece cap you posted).

Very interesting; thank you.

So, your nearest DIY metal fabricator should be able to do this for you in 10 minutes, if he has half a brain - or, get a half decent welder yourself and start having fun.

As I had promised, I got my hands on a unplated Silverite Dukoff D8. I had it analyzed with a X-ray particular material appraisal gun.

HERE IT IS !

98.32% Sn (Tin)
1.68% Cu (Copper)

So, as I had thought, they are basically a tin alloy.

Dukoffs vary dimensionally though the years.  The size of the wart and side squeeze in the throat area varies.  The baffles vary.  The facing quality varies.  These are more significant than any material variation would be.

            <pre class='message__body'>jdtoddjazz, is the mouthpiece (as) shiny on the inside as it is on the

Does it look like a similar finish?

It&#39;s probably been polished. I haven&#39;t seen a &#39;shiny&#39; one before.

            <pre class='message__body'>The past few years they have been buffed to a shiny luster.  When they first started doing it, I thought they had gone back to nickel plating them.  They will still turn gray after a few years.

Often you see what looks like the edge of a metal skin hanging below the table on the new ones.   I though it had the table masked off and it was a plating edge.  But this is from their buffing.

Tony F."
You will have to ask the owner when it&#39;s finished if he thinks it&#39;s still "chewed-out".   As for the effort, you should ask,  "Is any silverite Dukoff worth repairing?"  Being able to restore any damaged Dukoff to better than new condition with no more effort and material expense than making an epoxy repair, I have to say, "Yes.  Low amperage TIG repair is the only way to go."  I&#39;ll never use epoxy again.  That&#39;s nonsense.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, Tony....it was worth the effort.

It has been proven to me that a piece of equipment I had up to now shunned
as &#39;not my cup of tea&#39;
(inappropriate, too hot, too expensive, etc.) is, in fact, extremely
versatile.
It only takes a moment to recognise the multiple uses this could be put to.

As for the mouthpiece itself....yes; it too was worth the effort.
As stated earlier, a modern Dukoff can&#39;t be had in the UK for (much) less
than $300.00.
I can imagine the repair for this mouthpiece to be a maximum of £200.00.
In which case, Martinmods has not only saved a vintage mouthpiece (even if
the table WAS badly milled)
AND (potentially) saved his customer $100.00.
Financially (does anyone care about anything else these days?), it is a HIT!

The repair carried out on this particular mouthpiece has changed it beyond
recognition (from a playing p.o.v.)
It will no doubt play better than when it was new.
But even if this had only been a minor repair....restoring a (good) vintage
mouthpiece to playing condition...
it would have been worth it because history, a beloved mouthpiece
and.....CULTURE (dammit) have been preserved.

I&#39;ll climb down off my soap-box now, as I&#39;m sure y&#39;all don&#39;t want to listen
to me all day,
I&#39;m sure you&#39;d rather read the other (much more interesting) posts about
mouthpiece repair,
But I&#39;ll leave you with the thought that if nobody thought to repair
mouthpieces (even abortions such as this Dukoff),
The understanding of the parameters of a mouthpiece would remain firmly in
the hands of the makers...with the retailers
and other "middlemen"....all ready to make a buck off you....leaving you
none the wiser.

As I understand it, these pages are for people to discuss how to repair
mouthpieces...not just &#39;buy a new one&#39;.
So, I have to ask myself what you&#39;re doing here if you find the efforts so
futile?
You aren&#39;t, by any chance....a *retailer*, are you?

All the best,

David Smart.

"You do nice work, but unless it was a technical exercise was a chewed-out
old Dukoff worth the effort?

Tony F."

You will have to ask the owner when it&#39;s finished if he thinks it&#39;s still
"chewed-out".   As for the effort, you should ask,  "Is any silverite Dukoff
worth repairing?"  Being able to restore any damaged Dukoff to better than
new condition with no more effort and material expense than making an epoxy
repair, I have to say, "Yes.  Low amperage TIG repair is the only way to
go."  I&#39;ll never use epoxy again.  That&#39;s nonsense.

            <pre class='message__body'>David, 

You are welcome.  Some interesting facts:   I held the mouthpiece in my hand while welding it.  I could have repaired the side rails without removing the plastic bite plate, though I would have used a heat sink to be safe.  I now like pewter a lot as a mouthpiece material, much more than hard rubber, but not as much as stainless steel. Good material for a cheap line of mouthpieces.

No, I&#39;m definitely not a retailer and I&#39;ve repaired more than a few
mouthpieces, mostly of the clarinet persuasion. My query was based purely on
the cost/benefit of this much work as a commercial proposition. I quite
accept that a completely unreasonable amount of work may be justified on a

Yes, Tony....it was worth the effort.

As I understand it, these pages are for people to discuss how to repair
mouthpieces...not just &#39;buy a new one&#39;.

So, I have to ask myself what you&#39;re doing here if you find the efforts so

You aren&#39;t, by any chance....a retailer, are you?

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not regularly follow ebay prices.  A few years ago, the Miami Dukoff sop D8 was going for $450 or so.  Asian bidders were creating a demand because of their interest to have the same mouthpiece that Kenny G was using.  Miami alto and tenors were only going for $150 and non Miami AT $100.  

Prices went up some if new ones were out of stock at the retailers.   I&#39;m not sure why the sop Miami D7 went for $860 except that two bidders wanted it real bad.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m referring the the ebay listing in the UK, the link provided by GV in the beginning of this thread - 

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/vintage-Miami-Dukoff-SOPRANO-D7-original-and-unused-in-box-cap-and-ligature-NR-/261414066288?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3cdd7e1870&nma=true&si=Vdxf0%252BTANxAwrAhpwbP%252Fv2vaBq8%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557

The mouthpiece sold for $1325.00.  The listing states "unused" but the pictures tell a completely different and more interesting story.

            <pre class='message__body'>One certainly doesn&#39;t need 220V for this application.  Using flux core wire you have spatter, which will put pot holes all over your work.  A MIG using argon might work, if you can get the amperage down below 15A. You would also need timing circuitry, since you want to use it as a fine control (.1 sec resolution) spot welder.  This might be something to look into - http://www.pittnerovi.com/jiri/hobby/electronics/welder/
