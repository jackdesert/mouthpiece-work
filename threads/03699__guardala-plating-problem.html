            <pre class='message__body'>I have a 4 year old Guardala Studio Tenor piece and the plating on the 
table is bubbling and coming off. Is this likely to be causing leaking 
under the reed and should I get the mouthpiece refaced?

            <pre class='message__body'>Its pretty unlikely.  If, however, it feels too rough Id polish it with 
the BACK side of a sheet of sandpaper on a flat surface.  Paul Coats 
told me this idea for polishing tables once flattened.  Its probably 
equal to 2400 grit sandpaper and wont mess with the facing length 
unless you get wild and crazy.  The thickness of plating, unless nickel 
is really minimal.  Reeds swell.  You should not reface unless the 
piece needs it.  It puts it at risk and you loose valuable 
material/metal that you may need later in for a reface.  If it aint 
broke dont fix it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Sigmund,
I tried polishing the mouthpiece but I used 2000 grit with nothing 
but gravity and dragged it enough to get the bubbling off. I felt it 
and it is now completely smooth again.  about 60% of the gold plate 
came off in the process to expose the silver plate underneath.   I&#39;ve 
now played it again and works so much better in the low register.  I 
know I took a risk but I think it&#39;s paid off this time.

Still, I probably would like to get a backup of this mouthpiece.  
Does anyone know a mouthpiece that resembles a lazer trimmed studio 
guardala... Now that dave has stopped producing the studio?

regards,

            <pre class='message__body'>WW&BW is producing and selling the 4 Laser Cut Guardalas again, including
the Studio.  The previous production run was done by WW&BW without any
involvement by Guardala.  I would expect this and all future runs to be the
same.

With some minor facing tweeking, these pieces can rival the hand made
Guardalas.
