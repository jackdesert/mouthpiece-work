            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Sigmund,
I tried polishing the mouthpiece but I used 2000 grit with nothing 
but gravity and dragged it enough to get the bubbling off. I felt it 
and it is now completely smooth again.  about 60% of the gold plate 
came off in the process to expose the silver plate underneath.   I&#39;ve 
now played it again and works so much better in the low register.  I 
know I took a risk but I think it&#39;s paid off this time.

Still, I probably would like to get a backup of this mouthpiece.  
Does anyone know a mouthpiece that resembles a lazer trimmed studio 
guardala... Now that dave has stopped producing the studio?

regards,

            <pre class='message__body'>WW&BW is producing and selling the 4 Laser Cut Guardalas again, including
the Studio.  The previous production run was done by WW&BW without any
involvement by Guardala.  I would expect this and all future runs to be the
same.

With some minor facing tweeking, these pieces can rival the hand made
Guardalas.
