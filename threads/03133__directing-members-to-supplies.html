Perhaps on the main page there should be a brief statement and a link 
refering to a post or text file explaining how to best access all 
this "stuff" as kits are essentially unavaliable. It could be altered 
as items come and go.  Eventually the recent information in posts will 
become burried and potentially difficult to search.  Then we will 
answer the same questions again. It seems to the one of the first 
questions asked from new members...I know it was one of mine.

I put the URL to Jeff&#39;s suggested "kit" on the home page.

The Link to "Ralph&#39;s Tools" does not work for me.
