With all due respect Norman I&#39;d like to offer the following suggestions.

1.  If you don&#39;t like the conversation at another table---quit
eavesdropping and start your own conversation.

2.  Think of this (and any other) discussion forum as a banquet---take
what you want and leave the rest.

3.  Go out and buy some cheese to go with your w(h)ine.



John
