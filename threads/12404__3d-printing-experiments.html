            <pre class='message__body'>As some of you know, Saxgourmet Products has been experimenting (along with our manufacturing partner, EMRmachine) for the last couple of years with 3D printing. In spite of all of the hype on the internet, we have been through four generations of printers and a wide assortment of materials and were still not obtaining results that were to our standards.

I’m pleased to be able to report that the latest experiment produced a virtually perfect copy of our Dragon’s Tongue tenor mouthpiece which played right out of the printer. This prototype was printed in polycarbonate, which is extremely strong. Aside from some easily resolved minor cosmetic issues, we’re absolutely delighted, and now know that we can produce copies of any mouthpiece we choose to use as an input with extreme accuracy. We are going to see if we can obtain the same printing results in Delrin, which we prefer for its acoustic qualities.

Here’s a picture of the example we printed. Even the spiral threads of the tone chamber were accurately copied. We can also tint the material any color.

As some of you know, Saxgourmet Products has been experimenting (along with our manufacturing partner, EMRmachine) for the last couple of years with 3D printing. In spite of all of the hype on the internet, we have been through four generations of printers and a wide assortment of materials and were still not obtaining results that were to our standards.

 

I’m pleased to be able to report that the latest experiment produced a virtually perfect copy of our Dragon’s Tongue tenor mouthpiece which played right out of the printer. This prototype was printed in polycarbonate, which is extremely strong. Aside from some easily resolved minor cosmetic issues, we’re absolutely delighted, and now know that we can produce copies of any mouthpiece we choose to use as an input with extreme accuracy. We are going to see if we can obtain the same printing results in Delrin, which we prefer for its acoustic qualities.

 

Here’s a picture of the example we printed. Even the spiral threads of the tone chamber were accurately copied. We can also tint the material any color.

As some of you know, Saxgourmet Products has been experimenting (along with our manufacturing partner, EMRmachine) for the last couple of years with 3D printing. In spite of all of the hype on the internet, we have been through four generations of printers and a wide assortment of materials and were still not obtaining results that were to our standards.

 

I’m pleased to be able to report that the latest experiment produced a virtually perfect copy of our Dragon’s Tongue tenor mouthpiece which played right out of the printer. This prototype was printed in polycarbonate, which is extremely strong. Aside from some easily resolved minor cosmetic issues, we’re absolutely delighted, and now know that we can produce copies of any mouthpiece we choose to use as an input with extreme accuracy.

I’m not in the business of copying mouthpieces…..we’re only interested in using this technology to manufacture our own original designs……we duplicated one of our mouthpieces only because we wanted a point of reference…..sooner or later, I’m pretty sure somebody will offer duplication services…..the price of admission is pretty high right now

As some of you know, Saxgourmet Products has been experimenting (along with our manufacturing partner, EMRmachine) for the last couple of years with 3D printing. In spite of all of the hype on the internet, we have been through four generations of printers and a wide assortment of materials and were still not obtaining results that were to our standards.

 

I’m pleased to be able to report that the latest experiment produced a virtually perfect copy of our Dragon’s Tongue tenor mouthpiece which played right out of the printer. This prototype was printed in polycarbonate, which is extremely strong. Aside from some easily resolved minor cosmetic issues, we’re absolutely delighted, and now know that we can produce copies of any mouthpiece we choose to use as an input with extreme accuracy. We are going to see if we can obtain the same printing results in Delrin, which we prefer for its acoustic qualities.

 

Here’s a picture of the example we printed. Even the spiral threads of the tone chamber were accurately copied. We can also tint the material any color.

 There is anti bacterial PLA on the market but that works only for two years.
 

 I don't know how true that is for mouthpieces. I think the supplier bases his opinion on the answers he has to give on questions about food safety. Maybe it is different for mp's and maybe there is a way to treat 3D printed mouthpieces safe?

Since we don&#39;t store food in mouthpieces, one can argue that food
safety regs shouldn&#39;t apply - although I suppose if one encounters
bureaucrats looking to make trouble, sweet reason may not prevail. 

In
any case, inasmuch as these are bacteria that are *already* living in
the mouth, I don&#39;t see why this should be a problem for an individual&#39;s
mouthpiece. 

As far as selling 3D printed mouthpieces that you&#39;ve had
in your mouth during final adjustment, a germicide soak should suffice.
Bleach. Cetylcide. Ethylene oxide if you can find some place to do it
and are super serious about sterilization.
