  Very likely some type of Vandoren piece. Is there a small letter/number 
  marking to the left side of the table?

  Buffet also had their own piece with a crown near the base of the 
  table...

  No marking other than the lyre. I&#39;m guessing it is a Buffet, although the clarinet comes with a custom barrel and Harrison lig, so whoever had it before was not scared of making it "non-stock".

  Thanks,
  Toby
