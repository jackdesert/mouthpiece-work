I myself have only had good luck with Tenors up to 100mm - haven&#39;t
tried 104 yet. And my good old Dukoff is at 84 which seems short but
it works well for the design of the mpc. 
I am starting to really dig longer facings with a smaller tip opening
as I can now use my harder reeds and get just a killer open free
blowing piece. Right now am finding 100/.085-.087 to be a great combo.
The moragns I have are about 96/.090-.095 so I am wondering if when
the tip opens up a bit if I should shorten the facing a bit too. This
is on Plastics.

50 is the longest I have used so far on Tenor. Dukoff is 42.
I am thinking about extending into the 52 range...
Thanks Keith !

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve seen tenor facings up to 56.  But most of them were "stretched" only
for the .0015" feeler.  The rest of the facing curve was for a more normal
facing.

I would need to check my notes, but I think a RPC .150" tip tenor I
measured was a true 56, but it was made to play bari sax reeds.

Two things to look out for in longer facings are lip buzz from reed
vibration and air leaks out the sides.  If you play with a firm embouchure,
lip buzz is less, but you are probably closing off some of the facing
curve.

I think you can go up to 52, but after that you start to lose more than you
gain.  The 48-52 range is a gray area.

I generally pair wider tips with longer facings.  But I&#39;ve had a few
clients request wide tips and short facings.  I prefer medium long to very
long facings.  Going short loses the low end and does not gain enough on
the high end in my opinion to justify the loss.  The high end can be
altered without resorting to short facings.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith!
Yeah I found that my RPC was 50 and most of my Morgan&#39;s ran in the 48
range. I didn&#39;t have much success with response over the entire range
of my tenor until I broke thru to 50. Now these pieces are screamin&#39;!
I am using a fairy close tip too (.090) so I suppose that has
something to do with it, but my Morgan clones were not good results...
neither was my dukoff clone with 42/.090.
I am also finding the rail thickness not to be as much a factor as I
originally thought - right now I have a 50/.087 piece that screams and
it has thick rails like RPC. Tip rail is a different story as I think
it determines where the baffle starts - too thick and the response is
dampened.

Here&#39;s a question... what do you do when your own mouthpiece plays
better than every major brand you have tried? ;)
