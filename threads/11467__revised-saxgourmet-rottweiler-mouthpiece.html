            <pre class='message__body'>> Here&#39;s a picture of the revised ROTTWEILER mouthpiece .....other companies do a lot of talking about doing research and improving saxophone equipment.....we are actually doing it! Making the lake behind the tip rail deeper seems to be just the touch that was needed……obviously, this is an unpolished prototype…..I&#39;ve been experimenting with different chamber shapes (the chamber is elliptical) as well as variations in the window size……I&#39;m using a pure radial curve with a facing that measures 52 on a standard mouthpiece gauge….as you can easily see, this is an extremely aggressive design….it was a bit bright and thin sounding until I deepened the lake…..I&#39;m closing in on what I want from this design…..the tip is .105
