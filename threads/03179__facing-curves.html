Keith.......  For a clarinet with tip opening 1.10mm and a 34 length 
what would the numbers be for a radial curve...  are they 34 22 12 
6 ?    I just have these four gauges....include other numbers in case 
I get the  additional gauges.   Thanks   John Price

Your clarinet #s look good as rounded to whole numbers.  I tossed 
another clarinet spreadsheet in the Files section.  An alto one too. 

I did not insert extra sizes but this is simple to do.  Just insert 
rows and copy the formulas down.  Have someone who knows spreadsheets 
show you if you do not know how.  

I&#39;ve commented that I get better results on clarinet not using a 
radial curve.  But a radial curve is far from bad.  It is a good 
starting point for any refacer.

Thanks for publishing the Alto facing curve in the Files section
Keith.
I was going to ask about your findings on clarinet facings. As no one
seemed to pick up on this on previous postings.
I think you said you played a J5B. As this is considered a jazz piece
with a long lay and open tip 57/866,  have your findings been applied
 to this mouthpiece and just how  much flattening of the curve did you
find necessary. 
Where exactly was this applied and what were the changes in playing
characteristics?
