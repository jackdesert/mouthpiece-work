            <pre class='message__body'>Just received from WWBW a Guardala Crescent in the mail. Paid $249: 
great price! It looks to me very like a post-bop Guardala, judging 
from Mojo&#39;s pix. Chamber not a bullet chamber like some Guardalas, 
more squared off. Very thin side rails. Hollowed out section just 
beneath the tip rail. Can anyone explain the purpose of the design? 
Piece has great projection and very clean attack.

Thanks, JT
