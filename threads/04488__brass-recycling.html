As far as conventional plating goes, my guess would be gold.

  The recycling of the chips from manufacturing does not result in 
  "recycled brass" with a different chemical composition (some posts 
  implied it would somehow be different than "virgin brass").

  It is also nothing new, as the reprocessing of valuable scrap dates 
  back to perhaps the 18th century in some processes.

  The high lead "brasses" fall into the &#39;alpha-brass&#39; range of alloys 
  that are usually too soft for mouthpiece use. The exception is C485-
  type brass (Naval Brass, Leaded) which is used for its exception 
  machinability.

  What is the most inert plating that could be offered on a mouthpiece?
