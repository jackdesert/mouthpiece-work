            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve just finished doing work on a plastic Dukoff M7. This piece is now extremely responsive and lively because of the fairly high baffle.
The chamber on these is quite small with angles and drop offs everywhere and also straight sides leading in to the chamber.
I was going to completely round out the entry from the baffle ramp into the chamber as per my Guardala MB1. I would also cheak the sides.I thought that this may take a little of the harshness out, make it smoother and give it a bit more balls in the bottom end.

After taking in  all the last few weeks of chat about sizes of chambers and tuning, I am now hesitant.

Has anyone done this type of modification?

Thanks

The chamber in these is already so small I&#39;m not sure you can remove enough material to make it play out of tune before you get to the other side.  For a point of reference, however, Otto Link STMs have about 15.5mm-16.5mm wide chambers (depending on vintage), and generally play reasonably well in tune.  With the much  higher baffle and floor of the Dukoff, you could go even wider than that.  Talking about tenor pieces, BTW.  hope that helps

            <pre class='message__body'>You can take a look at the metal Dukoff rework photos on my site.  Tenor Dukoffs generally sound better with a larger throat and chamber.  They are still plenty bright enough after you cheek them out.  Re-tuning is easy to adjust to.  You just push them on 1/16"-1/8" more as needed.  Hardly noticeable unless you have been playing on the unaltered one for years.

            <pre class='message__body'>I forgot to mention that this is a tenor piece.
Thank you for your input and advice.
I will proceed with my original plan.

cheers
