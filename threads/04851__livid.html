            <pre class='message__body'>I posted this on SOTW today as well, but I thought some of you might
not see it there:

I came back from a coffee break today and found several of my
mouthpiece measuring tools missing from my bench. They included a
custom made tip gauge, feelers from 1.5 thou to .035", and one of my
glass gauges.

There are three of us in the shop, myself, the owner, and one other
tech. We had one clarinet customer in at the time, who was having some
adjustments done.

I asked who had removed the items, and no one answered. I went to get
something from the back, and noticed them by the customer&#39;s stuff on
the owner&#39;s bench. This customer had gone behind my bench and removed
the items without my permission, and then not owned up to it.

I&#39;m convinced had I not noticed them there, they&#39;d be gone forever.

I packed up my tools and took them home. I&#39;m leaving that store
anyways at the end of March (earlier, if I can) and I&#39;ve have to pack
up the tools sooner or later. I&#39;m not doing a large number of pieces
lately, due to all of the admin work I&#39;ve had to do, so it&#39;s not going
to affect my work.

The thing that bugged me most - the owner said there was no way the
customer could have done that, that I must have left them there.

I nearly bit his head off.

Thus endeth this rant.

Thank you.

These ones seem to have turned into lemons!

Doors close, new ones open.  Keep the spirit alive. Have a sip o&#39;the single 
and consider the options.

Truly, one of the most skillful juxtapositions of the holy spirit and
distilled spirits I have ever encountered.  Kudos.
