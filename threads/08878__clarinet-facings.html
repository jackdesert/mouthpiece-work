            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Yes, they've been very helpful. Most seem to have a flat section between the
.010 and .025 feelers, sometimes extending nearly to the tip. Some seem to
even have a 'concavity' in that area. At the table end, many have a shorter,
tighter curve than a radial plot. Facings generally in the 16-20 mm range.
Most pieces not designed specifically for jazz playing have tip openings in
the .040-.045 range. I'm just wondering if there are any general principles of
clarinet refacing or any insight into the nature of those curves that I'm
missing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dan, I have added flats to most of my relayed pieces. These usually
require an easing of the curve at, or before the .010" feeler point,
flattening between there and the .035" feeler, usually at the .025"
point (my feelers) then, continuing to the tip with a radial curve or
even another flat.
I have no scientific basis for this, except that it seems a common
practise by some makers.
  As I do not seek a legitimate tone, I avoid long lays and close tips.
I am experimenting with extra short 15mm lays at the moment, like the
old Brilhart * range, though I have tried 16mm, 17mm 18mm and longer.
The longer ones are difficult to control with tips in excess of .050" ,
they loose focus and do not articulate so well, but are good for note
bending, vibrato and blues styles of Jazz. N.O. or even cool west coast
Jazz style, with a hardish reed, but a bit resistant.

To make a flat on such a short lay is tricky. My method is to mark the
&#39;piece on both sides with a pencil, at either side of the desired flat
point location.
Wrap a piece of fine sanding paper round a 5mm dowel, laying this across
both rails simultaneously. Gently rubbing fore and aft, gives a fine
degree of control, without stepping outside the boundary of the pencil
marks.
Another tip. If using Rico Graftonites as blanks, avoid the #7 as it is
difficult to shorten the long lay. The material is very hard and it is
easier to open up a #3

I don&#39;t want to mess up the ones I have done as they play so well.
Previous posts suggest that they produce greater response,
liveliness,buzz etc.
I agree with this and have been able to reduce my tip openings of choice
and still get the desired response. Very reed friendly.

Hi Steve, It seems to add a liveliness to the response which also alters the tone away from the classic woody sound.
Earlier posts say it does not work on a sax MPC. I have not tried this. Eddie.

You would think so.  But when I measured up my best playing clarinet mouthpieces, they had flat sections.  They have gentle curves before/after a middle flat section.  Take a look at the curves posted in the Files - Clarinet section of the Yahoo site.

I ask this question because I do not know the answer: what is the advantage of the “flat spot”? It would seem to me that this would prevent the reed from smoothly “wrapping” along the facing……..I am unfamiliar with this technique

            <pre class='message__body'>Dan,The greatly enlarged curve appearing on the computer screen does
give the impression of an acute bend at the start of the flat section,
but the rather compact dimensions and gentle curve of the clarinet lay
prevent this in reality, I think.
IMO it is more of a subtle change of direction. The flat section is not
as dramatic as it looks on the screen.
It would be more so, if it was a hollow.

            <pre class='message__body'>WRT clarinet facings and flat spots:  go back and reread Erick Brand
refacing guide.  Most of this is dedicated to clarinet facing work,
and he gives (from memory, because I also need to reread it) some info
on this. He talks about a point of resistance, among other things.

I also seem to remember some time ago that someone on this forum made
the point that radial curves work well on sax, and a flatter facing on
clarinet, because of the difference in wave form between the two
instruments.
