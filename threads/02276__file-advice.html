            <pre class='message__body'>I was just perusing Micro-Mark&#39;s website, looking at file sets.  Keith 
had mentioned set #60526 - 10 coarse needle files - as a good starter.  
By the descriptions on the website, though, I was thinking of going with 
set #81063 - "mid-size file set" with rubber-coated handles (they match 
the description of another of Keith&#39;s reccomendations), which contains 
slightly smaller files.

&lt;http://www.ares-server.com/Ares/Ares.asp?MerchantID=RET01229&Action=Catalog&Type=Department&ID=11>

Any advice?  Should I bite the bullet and just get a couple of sets? 
Tiny files?  Rifflers?   Thanks in advance, folks.

BTW - I think I have chosen my first mouthpiece victim, er, 
"subject"...  A Yamaha bari mouthpiece (YBS-L1) with an uneven table, a 
big flat section in the curve, a very small tip opening (to be widened 
to the point where the facing curve can be corrected), and big tooth 
gouges on top.  It actually plays OK, considering, but it looks like 
lots of good practice in one mouthpiece.

I have both sets.  I use the 81063 set more and I am on my second set 
of these.  Stainless steel dulled my first set.  I would recommend 
wrapping sandpaper around files when working on SS or just plan on 
buying files regularly.  These sets really do not cost much.

I have a set of 82262 riffler files but they are a little too 
coarse.  Good for scooping out sidewalls, but they leave deep 
scratches that need a lot of sanding to clean up.  I did not like the 
looks of the 33111A riffler shapes, so I have not tried them.

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know what you guys have available in the US, but here in Japan I can buy small diamond files in various shapes for a buck apiece (made in China naturally). They cut through SS like butter--in fact you have to be careful or you end up taking off too much too quickly. 

They are definitely worth a try if you can find them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, that is why I posted the link... and it is an idea whose time has come.

I looked at pricing examples, and quantity is the thing.  As you order 
more units, the cost per unit drops at a fantastic rate.

Still, this is a possibility!

            <pre class='message__body'>I bought a set of fine diamond needle files at Harbor Freight for 
about $12.  The marks they leave are about the same as 320 grit 
sandpaper and polish out easily with 600 grit paper.  They don&#39;t "go 
through Stainless Steel like butter" but they do cut.  I use them 
with water as a lube and so far they haven&#39;t clogged up even when 
working on Dukoff Silverite (I keep them wet and use a fingernail 
brush on them every couple minutes).
