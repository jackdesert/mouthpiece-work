some jewelers send their workbench vacuum cleaners out to get gold

            <pre class='message__body'>I worked at a jewelery/pawn shop once (so I could get first dibs on the instruments that came out of pawn) -  and they always sent their buffing wheels (and all the buffing compound residue and lint around the buffer) out have the gold/silver reclaimed. Sorry that I don&#39;t know the details of where they sent it. I also remember back in the early days of computers, most all chips had gold contacts - when defective chips were replaced, the old chips were sent to have the gold reclaimed. At least the computer repairman I knew sent them out - he serviced DEC equipment and always had buckets full of bad chips with gold plated contacts that he was sending somewhere to be reclaimed.

Keith,
if you are in Italy I have the address for you, I&#39;m living in Torino
and near us there is a small city called Valenza, full of jewelries
shops... and because of this area of "gorders" there are too
specialized laboratory make easily to extrac gold from any source...
as the jeweller do. The husband of my mom was a dentist and I know
well he take the gold used on the mouth of customer when they change
the capsule, and this gold at 10/12 Kt. was cleaned to get a pure 18
or 24 Kt.
As a price for the job he usually left a part of the gold cleaned...
good technique to save even money! Ah ah ah.

Ciao. Gian
