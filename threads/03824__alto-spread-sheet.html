            <pre class='message__body'>Ive found your tenor spread sheet to be very helpful (thank you 
again).  They work great and are also a great starting point for some 
pieces.  I noticed in a previous post you offered to post a spread 
sheet for alto pieces if you were informed of targets.  I still fight 
my way through the facing curve program at times.  Id love a sheet that 
showed what you would suggest for a typical (meyerish) round chambered 
mouthpiece with targets starting from 70 to 90 in increments of 5 if 
you have the chance.

thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>I populated a spreadsheet for Meyer curves based on the table Ralph 
Morgan reported in the Sax Journal Meyer article from 1995.  I just 
used the tenor table, plugged in tip openings and facing lengths and 
then executed the Excell built-in solver routine that I had already 
set up for radial facing curves.  

Like Links, true Meyer curves may not be pure radial curves.  But this 
is the best we can do with the info we have.  Experiance has shown 
that accurate hand facing work to these curves will improve response 
as compared to how the mouthpiece leaves the factory.

The new alto spreadsheet is located in the Files Alto area.
