            <pre class='message__body'>To be a successful group, we need members!  Lurkers are welcomed but members who participate it what is needed.  

To get started, I&#39;ll ask John Talcott to post several summary posts he recently made on on the MouthpieceWork group on the status of the acoustic discussion that have been going on over there.  

I will steer new acoustic discussions over to this sister group.  Those who were fine with the way the info was flowing in the past simply need to join both groups.

You can also join this group and set your membership status so that you do not get the posts made via Email, or you get each post in and Email, or you only get them once a day in a single digest Email.  If you opt for no Emails, you just need to occassionally visit the Yahoo MouthpieceWork2-Acoustics site to read up on what has been going on.
