Out of curiosity, does anyone know what Johannes Gerber uses for his 
bite plate material?  It looks awfully comfortable (if it is flexible 
enough) and vaguely familiar in some unknown manner.

            <pre class='message__body'>This seems to be one of the big mysteries as I&#39;ve asked this a couple
of times before and I never get an answer!  Hopefully somebody will
know what this mystery material is and it&#39;s also in Sugal&#39;s and the
newer Guardalas although the Guardala is more firm.  It would seem to
be some kind of easily pourable plastic but a friend of mine who is
into boating and marine repairs says it&#39;s probably a gel coat resin. 
I dont know, I just hope somebody out there does and will share that
information!

The reports that have come my way is that it is a liquid rubber that 
sets in place after being poured.  That is the reason for the bite 
plate area being an enclosed well design. 

There is plenty of room to personalize your mouthpiece with this 
material. You can add sparkles or dye or a trademark under the clear 
rubber.  I think that the earlier Guardalas had a pink epoxy biteplate.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Guardala LTs have a clear material that is glued in place.  It may be
pre-poured in a form, but it is not poured in place.  It has a poor fit
height-wise and there is adhesive under it.

Sugals are also glued in place.  His material is only about 1/16" thick. 
It seems like a vinyl but I do not know what it is.

Acrylics are great materials for bite plates.  I use some sheet material
and also a 2-part castable.  The castable is tough to get pour without
bubbles in it.  But it works great otherwise.

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, Plexiglas is acrylic.  Poylcarbonate, would be a trade name such as, Lexan.  the great thing about actyulic, is that is one of the easiest plastics to bond.  The neat thing about Polycarbonate id that it isn&#39;t as brittle as acrylic and doesn&#39;t break as easily.

            <pre class='message__body'>Most certainly "PLEXIGLASS" (PERSPEX) which is acrylic and suposedly 
safe.
When Johannes started out I advised him to use it as I&#39;m also using the 
stuff. On my mouthpieces I harly ever us glue to fix the plexiglass to 
the mouthpiece , just a tight fit is enough to keep it in place.

You could look for blue nail acrylic.  Or clear and use blue color powder.  I have not tried these though.

I&#39;m guessing the 3M stuff has more adhesion.
