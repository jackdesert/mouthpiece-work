            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m experimenting with a plastic alto mouthpiece, (that I didn&#39;t pay for and don&#39;t play, so don&#39;t worry anyone!)
It&#39;s rails were uneven, and it had gouges in the table, and the tip was deformed a bit as well.

Using 0000 steel wool I was able to get most of the scratches and deformities on the tip to blend in. I tried to take the same amount of material off the other side as well, to keep it somewhat symmetrical. Mostly a success, so far...

Next I wanted to take the gouges out of the table, and shorten the facing.
After all the sanding I have done, I got the gouges out, and the table looks good, but the facing didn&#39;t get shorter... I experimented with some different techniques but wasn&#39;t able to find one that worked for me yet.

I used 3M no-slip grip backing 600 on a piece of plexiglass.

I think my unpracticed technique (and I hope the wrong materials had something to do with it too) made the table very slightly convex. I can&#39;t see or feel it the convexity by laying a straight edge on the table, but I&#39;m not getting a clear reading with the .0015 anymore. Depending on where I hold (put pressure on) the glass gauge I get different readings. Holding close to the window-u I get a somewhat consistent reading on the short side. But holding further back the feeler drops way down, sometimes even past the window-u. OOPS!

The no-slip grip didn&#39;t prevent the edges of the paper from coming up off the plexiglass at times, so I imagine this is part of the problem.

Any technique suggestions to prevent this in the future?
I started by pulling the mouthpiece backwards across the paper, but I think I got slightly better results by pushing it, with the tip leading the way. I was trying to bias toward the butt of the mouthpiece, but I didn&#39;t want to do that too much since I wanted to shorten the facing too. Maybe in experimenting with the right bias I made the concavity?

Any general technique suggestions to correct for convex tables would help (now that I CREATED this problem I should figure out how to fix it).

I&#39;m also going to get a better work surface, so any suggestions, or pros and cons for 3/8" glass and granite would be great.

I imagine using mylar backed sheets on granite is not an option, but would like to hear if anyone has tried it with success or failure.

I have watched the Mojo video, so I&#39;m considering going his route, but would like to know the other side of the coin as well since portability is not an issue for me.

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>Mike, 
Your analysis is correct -- you made the table convexed.  Your tools aren&#39;t the problem, though, your technique is.  You have to develop a proper feel for how much pressure to put where on the mouthpiece as you lap it in order to make it flat instead of convexed.  You may have to ruin a few, I know I did.  Also want to think about how you tell if it&#39;s flat.  Best way IME is to blue it.

A note about equipment -- it&#39;s tempting to get everything just right but you don&#39;t need to overengineer this particular area.  I use a Â£10 granite cutting board and just lay wet/dry sandpaper on top of it.

"Blue" it? please explain!

So you believe I should be able to learn this technique even on plexiglass?

Also, based on what you said, I guess I need to try to be as consistent as possible with whatever pressure/bias I am using, make a few swipes and then check the results?

Constant change of this bias will cause the convexity, right?

Cheers!

Convexity -- Not just variable pressure, pressure in the wrong spot will do it.

I wouldn&#39;t go so far as trusting plexiglass. Not flat enough, not hard enough.

Blueing it -- micrometer blue on a surface plate. touch the mouhtpiece to it. If it&#39;s flat the whole table will come up blue. For this you DO need a proper surfact plate. Offcuts of glass or granite aren&#39;t sufficiently flat for inspection.

You have to develop a proper feel for how much pressure to put where on the mouthpiece as you lap it in order to make it flat instead of convexed. You may have to ruin a few, I know I did. Also want to think about how you tell if it&#39;s flat. Best way IME is to blue it.

I can&#39;t see or feel it the convexity by laying a straight edge on the table, but I&#39;m not getting a clear reading with the .0015 anymore. Depending on where I hold (put pressure on) the glass gauge I get different readings. Holding close to the window-u I get a somewhat consistent reading on the short side. But holding further back the feeler drops way down, sometimes even past the window-u. OOPS!

I was trying to bias toward the butt of the mouthpiece, but I didn&#39;t want to do that too much since I wanted to shorten the facing too. Maybe in experimenting with the right bias I made the concavity?
