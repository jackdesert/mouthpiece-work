 I am on an eternal search for a good rock & roll tenor saxophone 
mouthpiece....I prefer metal but hard rubber is ok too....The 
criteria is that it must be precision made, and of a fair/resonable
cost. The mouthpiece must play well throughout the range of the 
horn...
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated....
Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>The Runyon Metal Smoothbore Spoiler models are good, reasonably priced, available in a wide range of tip openings, and will project well with a horn section or solo.  There is also a Delrin version, made on the same CNC machines to the same specs, called the XL.  To my ear, it sounds the same as the Metal Smoothbore.
   
  The Delrin version of the Quantum is also very good, and is favored by a lot of saxophonists here.  For whatever reason, I think due to the thinner sidewalls and beak vibrating more on the Delrin version, the Metal Quantum has a darker, smoother tone.  Not as much edge as the Delrin version.

            <pre class='message__body'>I used to struggle with this idea as well...that you need a &#39;special 
mouthpiece&#39; for R&R. I played Jumbo Javas, Dukoffs, Ponzol, Berg /0, 
etc...in search of the perfect R&R piece, while always continuing to 
play Link STMs for jazz, legit, big band, etc. A few years ago, I 
gave that up and decided to standardize on large chamber pieces for 
everything and just work on developing my &#39;sound&#39; into something I 
could project in a R&R situation. This work has paid off, and I can 
now blow walls down with my Florida Link.

In general, for rock and roll, you are looking for mouthpieces that have
high stepped baffles - these play louder and with more edge.  Some examples
would be Dukoff or the Rico Metalite (occasionally seen on ebay, altho
recently they reappeared on the WWBW website), or (more expensively) the
Ponzol M2.

If you have a mouthpiece on which you play comfortably, but which doesn&#39;t
have the dynamic range and edge you need,  try making a baffle insert for
your mouthpiece while you&#39;re hunting for something better. You might be
pleasantly surprised.

A mouthpiece will play louder and with more edge with a baffle insert. The
more extreme the baffle insert, the more pronounced the effect.

Commercially, the Runyon "spoiler" is such a baffle insert (IMO by
experimentation, the metal tail on these has little function; the main
effect is from the wedge-shaped insert.)

My own personal preference is to shape  baffle inserts out of pieces of
sidewall sawn from 2 inch PVC water pipe, fit so that they will wedge into
place without glue, but can be popped out if necessary. It helps to have a
grinding wheel. I&#39;ve also used lucite and the bottoms of some old cheap
plastic reeds.

As an easy experiment, try making a baffle insert from some "blue-tack".
Santy Runyon described using chewing gum for this purpose.

            <pre class='message__body'>By way of illustration, regarding baffle modifications:

Link Alto with baffle insert by J Gerber:

Pieces I&#39;ve added baffles to, with satisfactory results:
http://launch.ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/MouthpieceWork/photos/view/69f4?b=1

- Selmer alto with wedge-shaped baffle and 1/8" rear step
- Ponzol tenor M1 with steep front wedge, tapered to add no additional step
to existing baffle.
- Graftonite A-chamber tenor with wedge-shaped baffle and 1/8" rear step

I find that these baffle mods help me get the sound I want, from mouthpieces
that were not quite satisfactory as is.
Chacun a son gout.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi saxman...

I know there are on this site Runyon users... and I have only
experienced a Quantum 10 spoiler. If you like a rowdy mouthpiece very
noisy and full of "metallic" power... this should be ok. Personally I
feel it without personality, but the way to appreciate a mouthpiece is
different for all players...
(don&#39;t tell Paul... but really I don&#39;t like the sound of that Runyon!)

On other side if you like a r&r piece you can test Barone Contemporary
or for a very good price the Ponzol M2. Personally I prefer the sound
of  Dukoff, I&#39;ve one retouched from Mojo that&#39;s fabolous because he
make a medium-long facing to give me a better low notes when pushing
with more easy blowing.
Also not bad a SR technologies, and I got times ago a Sugal Gonzo II
so roarrrrrr... kinda low notes with a tiger inside.
