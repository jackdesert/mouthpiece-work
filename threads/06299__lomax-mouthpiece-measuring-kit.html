            <pre class='message__body'>This is the first time I have seen it.  The tip gauge looks nice, but probably inflates the kit price a lot.  The glass gauge is worth ~$20 and the feelers &lt;$10.  The feeler set may be enough for clarinet work but more sizes are needed for open tipped sax mouthpiece curves.

I sell my kit for $100 and I give you the feelers up 
to .125"

            <pre class='message__body'>let me tell you that you&#39;ve GOT to have the larger feelers, which are
generally unavailable at auto parts stores. I got some from Jim, and they
changed my life
