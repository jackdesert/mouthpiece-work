            <pre class='message__body'>Been quite lately, huh?  I&#39;ve been taking a break from mouthpieces 
but I&#39;ll get back to it in a week or two.  I&#39;ve been working on a 
new "hobby" making lamps out of instruments.  I think the old "make a 
lamp out of it" jokes are more popular than the lamps actually are.  
But they are fun to make and are a lot easier than mouthpiece work!  
Except for the trumpet lamp, that one was tough to snake the wire 
through.  I&#39;m giving away a few as gifts and trying to sell some at 
the local music store here in southern New Jersey.  I may toss one on 
Ebay, we&#39;ll see.  

I put a Gallery photo in the MouthpieceWork Photos/other photos 
section.  Take a look!  There are several sites out there selling 
instrument lamps.  They are mostly overpriced in my opinion.  That is 
why I took a shot at it.

A perfect use for clarinets... in my opinion.  Hell, clarinets are
inherently defective in design, they only come with half of the overtone
series.  The other half were lost somewhere eastern Europe prior to WWI.

I had bid on one made from an SML alto, just to get it for spare parts!

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m not a real fan of clarinet either, though I do play them as the need
arises.  It felt good shoving a wire up its bell.  I do admire its range,
but that is at the expense of having to think in 12ths.
