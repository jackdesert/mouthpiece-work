            <pre class='message__body'>An interesting point by Dr. Fletcher:

"Because all the pipe modes are coupled through the non-linearity of the reed generator, the pipe impedance that is important is not just that at the frequency of the fundamental but rather a weighted average over all the harmonics of the fundamental. If the instrument is well designed then its resonance peaks will be in closely harmonic relation, the weighted impedance will be large, and the instrument will be responsive and stable. If, however, some of the resonances are misplaced, not only will the weighted impedance be lower, giving a less responsive instrument, but also the frequency at which the weighted impedance is greates will depend on the harmonic content and thus on the dynamic level or loudness, giving the instrument an unreliable pitch."
