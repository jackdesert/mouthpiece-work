            <pre class='message__body'>The Link table you made up was great.  I have a current link on which 
Ive been experimenting.  I have been playing it with the factory facing 
that I had straightened.  Tonight I was unsatisfied and/or perhaps a 
bit bored.  I applied your 7* facing and BOOM!  Immediate improvement 
in projection, volume, and ease of play.  I never hardly adjusted my 
embrochure to play the whole range of the horn.  It all popped.  Thanks 
for posting it and of course maintaining this forum.

            <pre class='message__body'>Glad it worked out.  You need a good plan, good tools and gages, and 
good execution.  Sounds like you did your part.

            <pre class='message__body'>Your efforts are appreciated.  I have a couple of alto pieces I want to 
redo.  I picked up an old Buescher to noodle around on....Again, thanks!
