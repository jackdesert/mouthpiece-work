            <pre class='message__body'>Odly enough, no one has ever asked me to restore mouthpiece gilding.  In case they do, I have a supply of Amaco "Rub &#39;n Buff".  It is between a paint paste and a shoe polish.  I use the Rub &#39;n Buff white to highlight the etched lines in the LAW glass gages I sell on my site.  I think it would work well on HR mouthpieces too.

            <pre class='message__body'>The problem with using any type of colored "filler" is the woodgrain. It is difficult (but not impossible) to get pigment out of the woodgrain surrounding the logo.  With paint, you would probably have to use some type of chemical (as Krylon states in their website instructions, follow the prior link) - this might have a drying effect, removing natural oils from the area that was being worked.  Krylon also recommends sanding the affected area. mark

    A little off-topic; however, does anyone know if using a paint pen, like this, would cause any problems id used on the wood body of a clarinet or oboe? Would it smear & fill the grain?

  Thank you,

            <pre class='message__body'>I just re-guilded a mp yesterday using a Krylon gold pen.  It was a white plastic mp with no paint left in the faint engraving and I wanted to see what brand.  I apply the paint and wipe off most of the excess when still sticky.  Then, I let it completely dry and use a very mild polish to remove the residue, trying to go "across the grain" as much as possible to make sure I don&#39;t remove the paint in the engraving.  Using a piece of cork works good because it doesn&#39;t tend to go down into the engraving like cloth would.

The mp is a "Reeves" and has a lyre above the logo.  Woohoo!!  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s worth thousands (of pennys).  Actually, my research was that the trademark Reeves was used by various entities on both sides of the Atlantic when this vintage piece was made (and now Reeves is a trademark for an Asian sax).

I&#39;ve also used the metalic gold Krylon pen to re-guild wood clarinet logos.  The last one was kind of an elaborate logo that I wanted to stand out.  What I did was used a black "grease pencil" (actually wax) to carefully color/mask the area around the logo and fill in the wood grain, being careful not to get any in the engraving.  Then, when the paint was applied to the engraving, it rubbed off of the majority of the surrounding area easily.  Once the paint dried, the wax can be polished off and reveal the wood grain again.  There was still a slight amount of gold glitter that managed to stay in the residual wax in the grain, but only noticable to me.  Turned out so nice I even took a photo.
