            <pre class='message__body'>I have a bari mpc that has been bugging me for a while.  The tip rail does not fit the shape of my reeds but it plays fine.  The reed seals up with the &#39;suck test&#39; and while I&#39;m hesitant to tackle re-shaping of the tip, I just might get to the point of doing that someday.  I hesitate in part because this is a mpc from a well known individual that is known for quality pieces.  At the moment, it just bugs me that the tip shape is different &#39;cause each time I put a reed on I see it.
 
So, my questions - How important is it for the tip to be shaped the same as a reed [ie - should I bother]?  
Am I likely to need to do other things to the mpc once I try re-shaping the tip [presumably the side rails will be affected]?
 
Thanks,
Ralph

Its not a huge deal in my opinion unless the tip rail is very thin.  

As a test, try reshaping your reed tip to fit the mouthpiece.
