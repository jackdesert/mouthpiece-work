            <pre class='message__body'>I am trying to understand with what appears to me, to be he
contradictory statements on clarinet MPC flat spots. 
ko4py states in post 3357, that a flat on an M13 (or was it a 15) gave
an inferior tone when compared with other similar pieces without the
flat. Here I assume he is refering to the facing and not the table ?
Was this inferior tone not sufficiently "Classical" ?
 Post 765 seems to give a different perspective.
I have just cloned a J5B facing, from the files section, on a
Graftonite and am delighted with the response and tone of this MPC,
with it&#39;s long flat in the centre of the facing. 
It is also very tolerant of differing reed strengths.
Perhaps we are not comparing &#39;like with like&#39; here?  as the J5B is an
open faced jazz piece, with a non-classical tone.
Maybe flats are more beneficial on open lays, where the classical
tone is not required ? 
 Not all clarinettists aspire to a classical tone.           Eddie

Contradictions will exist.  Both a valid experiances reported to this 
group.  After many reported experiances, some generalities can be 
made.  Maybe even some consensus.

I think we can say that some, possibly many, good clarinet facings have 
flat sections.  Some, possibly many, do not.  Some have uneven rails.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think it&#39;s a matter of what you&#39;re looking for. 

I use several M15&#39;s, as well as other mouthpieces, including some
wide-open stuff like Portenoy. All of my M15&#39;s have a near near
perfectly radial (circular) facing, except one. All have flat tables
(now). The one that has a flat spot on the facing has a sound that&#39;s
was less resonant, and more reedy, thin and edgy that the others. 

I am looking for a very classical sound - like Karl Leister or Ricardo
Morales. The approach is a close mouthpiece (like M15 with 103.5 tip)
with Vandoren #4 reeds, which is quite different than the more open
sound like 5JB (147 tip). They really are opposite ends of the sound
spectrum. The 5JB is really lively and has quite a bit of zing in the
sound, which is not considered a liability for jazz playing, whereas I
am looking for a pure dark, resonant sound with no hint of any reed
sounds in it. I guess that&#39;s the difference.

            <pre class='message__body'>I find reed buzz comes from softer reeds (used on wider tips).  Flat spots
can donate their own edgy sound on a sax mouthpiece, but I have not noticed
a lot in clarinet tone.  But then again, I do not dabble in close tips with
very hard reeds.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks all for comments on flat spots.
I might try an experiment with two identical blanks giving one a curve
and the other the same curve plus a flat spot. If so, I will report my
findings, but I think that getting two curves to match exactly on the
small dimensions of a clarinet piece is difficult enough without
adding the flat.  This may effect the test results slightly.    Eddie
