The Bernoulli effect makes the reed speak easier.  It focuses the players air velocity in a way that creates a vacuum to get the reed moving with less effort by the player.  It is not an acoustic effect but a fluid mechanics effect.

Any brightness would need to be explained from acoustics, such as wave reflections/reinforcement.

The Ferron book has a few diagrams of simple 2D wave reflection diagrams in mouthpieces and frequency spectrums for the same mouthpieces.  I think he was on to something.

I found that section interesting as well, thus the simple Maya model/ray tracing to verify his diagrams.

Or are you referring specifically to his diagram of the ramp (as he calls it) as an obstruction and the resultant frequency spectrum showing non-harmonic partials?

A mouthpiece with a baffle insert that has a cross section somewhat like a
curved airfoil or half of a nozzle plays differently depending on whether it
is placed closer to the tip or base of the reed.  Closer to the tip, it&#39;s a
brighter sound. At least, that&#39;s what I find, when experimenting on baffle
placement.

Different placement changes where the vacuum forces are applied to the reed,
so the reed responds differently, and the sax sounds and plays differently.
I don&#39;t see that this primarily is a wave-reflection effect, although there
will also be sound reflection from a baffle.

            <pre class='message__body'>As to Bernoulli forces, Nederveen states, "Worman (1971) calculates the magnitude of the Bernoulli forces which supposedly influence the balance of forces on the reed.  In a single reed, with it&#39;s relatively short slit, these forces are negligible, but in a double reed, with it&#39;s relatively long and narrow slit, they would have to be dealt with."

Scavone:  Aside from Scavone&#39;s personal observations regarding the effects of reed dampening and high register playing, the bulk of the acoustical analysis of single reed instruments in his thesis, is basically a synopsis of the studies made by other acousticians. Regarding the treatment of mouthpiece types and design in his modeling study, he states, "It is likely that the mouthpiece geometries could be modified to produce better resonance alignment, though the purpose of this analysis was simply to determine any signicant differences between the two designs. (fat vs. narrow)  

As such I question if one should consider Scavone&#39;s thesis as the "End All" of acoustical thought as regards the saxophone and saxophone mouthpiece design.

Nederveen states that the total oscillative flow entering the instrument consists of the oscillative flow through the slit (player supplied air pressure interrupted by reed valve) combined with the oscillative flow caused by the transverse motion of the reed itself.  He goes on to say that instead of viewing the reed motion as a fictitious cavity at the tip of the reed, one can translate the reed motion into a "corresponding widening of the bore over the length which is bounded by the reed.  Note that the pressures over the whole length of the reed are practically constant as there is a node here.  Then a position-dependent volume increase of the cross sectional area.....can be calculated..."

It is this transverse vibration of the reed surface which Ferron compares (without the conditional math, though I&#39;m inclined to believe he could have provided it) to a vibrating metal bar held in a vise, and it&#39;s 90 degree from any point on the tangent of the lay advancing pressure wave, which would reflect off the inclined baffle shape in the incident angle equals reflective angle manner.  He postulates that tracing the reflective route of the wave from any point on the reed can server to better understand some of what takes place inside the mouthpiece, and that through correctly focusing and directing the wave, by means of the baffle angle and ramp design, one can improve the mouthpiece&#39;s resonance and response.  

This is Ferron&#39;s theory, not mine. (so attack it if you will, but direct the attack appropriately)  He certainly had an advanced degree of practical insight into the saxophone and clarinet.  I see no reason to disregard his contribution to the saxophone/mouthpiece conversation simply because he did not provide advanced math to entertain the physicists.  The fact is, he went to depths (baffle focus and tone hole chimney height tuning) of specific acoustic analysis, as a result of extensive personal experimentation and experience, that others have yet to bother to even consider.

Have any of you actually done this?  Constructed mouthpieces with short, fat chambers vs long tapered chambers?

I have.  This is what happens.  

Start with a mouthpiece that plays well in tune, the palm keys play in tune relative to the rest of the instrument, etc.  Such a mouthpiece would have a "medium" chamber... and this would be regardless of baffle, etc.  

Use a bit close to the "bore" size and go in from the shank or butt end, and extend the bore into the chamber area.  Let me say here, any bore exposed past the end of the neck is part of chamber volume.

Now get out the Dremel tool and start carving away sidewalls, and grinding away what you can reach from the window.

What you end up with is something similar to the old Buescher, Conn, Caravan, Rasher, etc mouthpiece type.  

No matter how much material you remove, in order to tune up with the usual tuning notes, you have to push the mouthpiece onto the cork (now very far onto the cork) so that the volume past the end of the neck is equal to the missing conical section.  

Play the mouthpiece... what happens?  It is reasonably in tune over most of the range, but when you begin to play on the short end of the tube, the palm key notes, it is very sharp.  The mouthpiece is now too short, though the volume is correct.  

It seems that the low register, with the way the nodes and antinodes lie, it tunes by mouthpiece volume.

But the upper register tunes by length, too.

OK, let&#39;s go the opposite way... let&#39;s get out the putty and start filling in, making a long narrow "pea shooter" mouthpiece.  Put it on the cork and tune up.  Now you have to pull out, to gain volume inside, so that once again the volume past the end of the neck is equal to the missing conical section.  You have the regular tuning note well tuned, but the mouthpiece is barely hanging onto the end of the neck cork.

Play the instrument and you will see that when you get to the short end of the tube, the palm key notes are... flat!  The mouthpiece is too long, though the volume is correct.

I&#39;ve been through this process in experimenting with bass sax, soprano sax, and tenor sax mouthpieces, noting tuning tendencies.  I had even constructed a soprano sax mouthpiece with removable inserts of various length (inserted into the bore, shoved up to the throat area) to change volume and length relationship.  I still have that mouthpiece around somewhere, but in the end I glued in the best insert.

If anyone would like to experiment with this, I suggest getting 3 Runyon Model 22 alto or tenor mouthpieces.  I can get a basic unmarked but faced mouthpiece for you quite cheaply.  Leave one unmodified.  Fill in the baffle, chamber, and throat on one.  Hog out the other one with your Dremel tool.  Check the results for yourself.

In the end, like Goldilocks, the mouthpiece must be neither too hot, nor too cold, nor too hard, nor too soft... it must be "just right".

            <pre class='message__body'>Just a quick note here. In order to be reasonably in tune
in the palm notes, there is a second condition that a mpc
has to fulfill in addition to having the correct volume to
mimic the truncated cone. For the notes where 1/4
wavelength is the same as or shorter than the length of
the truncation it is important that the Helmholtz
resonance of the mpc be similar to that of the truncated
apex. In order to do this you need a constriction at the
end of the chamber. The volume of the chamber (and baffle
area) plus constriction (throat) must still equal the
volume of the apex, but by playing with the diameter of
the constriction those palm notes can be brought into
tune.

I have seen this "requirement" before.  But in practice there are many mouthpieces (like Links) that play "reasonably in tune" that have no constriction.  Unless the end of the neck counts as a constriction.  Then it is not a mouthpiece requirement.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m sure it was mentioned before - Benade considers the neck as the constriction.  

Oboe: reed + staple (constriction) = missing cone volume
Bassoon: reed + bocal (constriction)= missing  cone volume
Saxophone: mpc + neck (constriction = missing cone volume

Further, in order to satisfy production of the higher modes, the played frequency Frs of the reed cavity attached to it&#39;s constriction (sax mouthpiece on neck) must equal the frequency of the theoretical missing cone, the length of which can be calculated by the body taper and diameter information.  Small changes in the shape of the reed cavity and constricting tube (neck) to improve accuracy of this imitation.

Additionally, Nederveen cites Rockaboy (1989) and Gokhshtien (1982 nad 1995), stating that for conical instruments (both single and double reeds) the ratio of the time the reed is closed to the time the reed is open is approximately equal to the ratio of length of truncation of the cone to the length of the tube to the apex. 

So it looks like the neck is the constriction.

            <pre class='message__body'>So, if one really loves the spread sound of that big fat, but too short mouthpiece, then perhaps lengthening the neck with a cylindrical section would make the short tube notes manageable.

            <pre class='message__body'>Check out Benade&#39;s 1977 paper on the evolution of wind
instruments. It is on pg 21 IIRC. It is at MARL on the
Benade Archive page under Writings>70s

Here is a quote from Fletcher and Rossing:

"While the saxophone has a single reed like the clarinet,
the mouthpiece effectively truncates the conical taper of
the main bore and introduces significant changes in tone
color. In order that the horn modes be as nearly harmonic
as possible, it is desirable that the mouthpiece mimic the
acoustic behavior of the missing apex of the cone. This
can be done at two frequencies, and then fits reasonably
well over the whole range. At low frequencies, the
matching is achieved if the internal volume of the
mouthpiece is equal to that of the missing conical apex,
which requires that the mouthpiece have a slightly bulbous
internal shape so that it actually constitutes a sort of
Helmholtz resonator. The high-frequency match can then be
achieved by arranging the shape of the constriction where
it joins the main part of the instrument so that the
Helmholtz resonance frequency of the mouthpiece is the
same as the first resonance of the missing conical apex,
at which it is half a wavelength long."

Of course this includes the point where the mouthpiece
joins the conical body of the instrument at the neck end,
and the diameter of the neck at that point.

This is analogous to the dead space between the embouchure
hole and crown stopper on the flute: the Helmholtz
resonance of this space must be correct to bring the high
end of the flute into tune, otherwise the third register
is around a quarter tone sharp.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, it&#39;s true that the constriction happens at the
smallest point: the end of the neck. My guess is that if
one removes too much material in the chamber, it creates a
mismatch between the volume and the constriction. Don&#39;t
forget that the Helmholtz resonance can vary for the same
volume as a function of the diameter of the exit hole, and
likewise a HH resonance can be adjusted for a given exit
hole by changing the volume.

This is not to say that the length of the mpc does not
play a part, but I have just finished finding out that
long/short tube intonation mismatches in conical woodwinds
are primarily due to volume mismatches, which change
frequency ratios between the modes differently depending
on tube length, and only secondarily to changes in the
actual length (to my surprise).

            <pre class='message__body'>But all volume is not created equal. Low baffle + small
chamber does not equal high baffle + big chamber in terms
of sound and response, even if the lay is the same and
ditto the internal volume. So isn&#39;t the "secret" in
distributing the volume between the tip rail and the
throat?

BTW if there is a length mismatch you should get the same
thing in the lower mode, with the short-tube notes getting
progressively sharper up to C#2 and then a big drop to D2.
If it is only in the palms, with reasonable tuning up to
C#3 then the cause is not necessarily the length.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, it&#39;s true that the constriction happens at the
smallest point: the end of the neck. My guess is that if
one removes too much material in the chamber, it creates a
mismatch between the volume and the constriction. Don&#39;t
forget that the Helmholtz resonance can vary for the same
volume as a function of the diameter of the exit hole, and
likewise a HH resonance can be adjusted for a given exit
hole by changing the volume.

This is not to say that the length of the mpc does not
play a part, but I have just finished finding out that
long/short tube intonation mismatches in conical woodwinds
are primarily due to volume mismatches, which change
frequency ratios between the modes differently depending
on tube length, and only secondarily to changes in the
actual length (to my surprise).

            <pre class='message__body'>Where&#39;s my sax&#39;s truncation start?  

Interestingly, as mentioned earlier, Nedvereen cites Rockaboy and Gokhshtien, stating that for conical instruments (both single and double reeds) the ratio of the time the reed is closed to the time the reed is open is equal to the ratio of length of truncation of the cone to the length of the tube to the apex. The simple explaination for this is:  When the reed is open, a compression wave travels the length of the tube and returns as a rarefraction and closes the reed.  With the reed now closed, the tube becomes a resonator, and the resonance frequency of the truncation (mouthpiece+constriction or compliance+inertance) comes into play.  The rarefraction will travel the length of the truncation, as far as the opening of the body tube and return as a compression wave, to open the reed, and the cycle of waves in a conical instrument begins again. So the reed stays closed for as long as it would take a wave to travel from the truncation to the theoretical apex and back, regardless of whatever note is being played. How is this information usefull to us?

The simple explaination for this is:  When the reed is open, a compression wave travels the length of the tube and returns as a rarefraction and closes the reed.  With the reed now closed, the tube becomes a resonator, and the resonance frequency of the truncation (mouthpiece+constriction or compliance+inertance) comes into play.  The rarefraction will travel the length of the truncation, as far as the opening of the body tube and return as a compression wave, to open the reed, and the cycle of waves in a conical instrument begins again. So the reed stays closed for as long as it would take a wave to travel from the truncation to the theoretical apex and back, regardless of whatever note is being played. How is this information usefull to us?

Sure John, but consider:

1. not every mouthpiece complements every horn or player
2. many players are still weeding out what doesn&#39;t work for them and why
3. practicing on a mouthpiece that compliments you and your instrument is time and energy better spent than making just anything work.
4. thus, time spent weeding isn&#39;t necessarily wasted.

YES!!!  I was waiting for someone to say this.


And Toby&#39;s comparison of the "dead space" by the end of the neck and the flute, from embouchure hole to end plug is also right on.

See, guys?  Now we&#39;re getting somewhere, and we don&#39;t even need math equations or computer modeling!

            <pre class='message__body'>"But all volume is not created equal"

Some observations:

1. Lengthening or widening chamber increases Vtotal and lowers Frs.
2. Shortening constriction tube decreases Vtotal and raises Frs
3. Enlarging constriction increases Vtotal and raises Frs.
4. Chamber is a compression anti-node.
5. Constriction is a displacement anti-node.
6. Changing Frs affects nodes (higher frequency) in the area of constriction
7. Reed closed time determined by Frs

Vtotal = volume of truncation (chamber + constriction)
Frs = resonant frequency of truncation (chamber + constriction)

In ideal cone, body tube sees the displacement anti-node of the constriction, above the body tube entrance for high frequencies and moving down into the upper body tube for lower frequencies.

I can see how to make this mod by hogging out the chamber or pulling out tht mouthpiece.

I&#39;m not sure what this modification would entail.  Shortening the sax neck does not sound right.  If a mouthpiece has a squeeze chamber, how would it be "shortened".  It is a diameter change?

This sounds more like a diameter change.

Which would be the notes shown on the end of the neck diagrams in Ferron?

Would the this effect the (saw-tooth triangle) wave shape of the sax sound?  If the reed is closed more during the cycle, does the tone sound more edgy?  Less of a sine wave tone?

So we need to know the "theoretical Frs" to make use of this.

It&#39;s not a diameter change.  Though Benade insists on the neck being part of the truncation, it&#39;s not clear if he meant the entire removable neck piece or just a section at the small end which acoustically serves as the constriction.  The telling factor would be perhaps, what does the body tube, as it actually functions, see as the constriction, the end of the truncation and the entrance to the body - the amount of reed closed time would tell us as it equals the amount of time for a wave to travel from the truncation/body entrance to the theoretical apex and back.

Benade also warned of double chambered mouthpieces.  I don&#39;t know if anyone actualy made a double chambered mouthpiece (in the sense of today&#39;s Greiffenhagen or Weinberg models) in the &#39;70&#39;s when he wrote this.  Perhaps he was referring to squeeze chambered mouthpieces, with their own constriction and back bore, which would perhaps conflict with the neck constriction, and be seen as a double chamber by the body tube.  If so, then perhaps those who prefer squeeze chambers should use cylindrical shank insert rings (like clarinet tuning rings), to match the inner diameter of the neck opening, until the chamber opens up.  Time to experiment.



"3. Enlarging constriction increases Vtotal and raises Frs.

Correct.


"6. Changing Frs affects nodes (higher frequency) in the area of constriction
>

I don&#39;t know that Ferron illustrated his own book and that those diagrams are accurate.  This is why we need a good W Curve chart.


"7. Reed closed time determined by Frs

The pressure chart in Nedvereen (p. 126) and explaination (what I can understand) shows the closing at the end of the cycle.  A Clarinet is roughly 50% open/50% closed, while the conical instruments&#39; ratio is higher on the open side.  This accounts for the soprano sax being much louder than the Bb clarinet.   If the actual wave form followed the pressure across the reed ratio, then the less close time, the edgier the sound.

At this point, I&#39;m wondering if Benade considered the neck as part of the truncation in these respects:

1.  The mouthpiece must be inserted onto the neck and adjusted for tuning.  One must calculate the displaced volume of the neck in the shank in order to get the mouthpiece volume.  Without the neck, you can&#39;t know the volume.

2.  The neck functions as the constriction of the truncation and the displacement anti-node for the truncation&#39;s resonant frequency, however, since the mouthpiece volume/theoretical truncation volume ratio should be 1/1, the neck opening is functionally, a 2 dimensional constriction, having no length to speak of.  This would be the difference between oboes/bassoons with smaller than 1/1 ratioed chambers, and saxophones.

            <pre class='message__body'>Something to consider:

If saxophones were made so that the mouthpiece fit into an enlarged socket on the end of the neck, with intonation rings ala clarinet for adjusting tuning, would the preferred diameter of the entrance to the mouthpiece match the inner diameter of the neck opening?  It would probably depend on chamber length/size issues. Is the inner shank diameter acoustically functional and preferable, or is it just a mechanical result of the mouthpiece being made to fit over the end of the neck cork?

            <pre class='message__body'>Missing Cone Volume Measurement Error

Guys, 

According to Nederveen, if you calculate the missing cone volume from the neck taper, you are making two calculation errors.  Nederveen, reviewing findings of Kergomard (1988) and Dalmont (1995)(p.119) regarding oboe bore irregularities, and earlier (p. 39), shows the calculation based on the taper of the instrument&#39;s main body.  Additionally, many oboes have a section with an increase in cone angle in the upper body (as the saxophone does in the different neck taper).  Nederveen&#39;s diagram shows that in order to get the correct missing volume calculation, one must add to the initial calculation based on the main body taper, the volume lost due to the increased cone angle, from where the increased angle begins, up to the original truncation.

So, 
 
1. calculate the missing volume based on the body cone taper from the body truncation (without the neck) to the apex.

2 calculate the volume of the actual neck (from neck tube, not tenon).

3. subtract results of #2 from #1.

The remainder is the actual missing cone volume, which your mouthpiece should compensate for.

Indeed.  Your point was very well made regarding the shape of the chamber/baffle. Additionally, Bernoulli effects aside, it is still an air column, with a compression anti-node, an irregular bore, and a displacement anti-node at the other end, and as such, the effects of  bore irregularities on the pitch of the different modes of differnt notes, each with a different wave length, still apply - even more so, since it all starts here.  Given accurate cross-sectional volume information along the entire length of the truncation, one could make a W curve chart that would assist greatly in analysis of which shape where does what to which resonance mode, of which  note, pitch-wise, in every register, and how to align resonances for optimal harmonic regime formation.  I&#39;m surprised that such mouthpiece design/analysis software is not abound yet - W Curve Chart excel sheets anyway.    

Computed tomography (x-ray) would give exact info on existing mouthpieces -  http://www.idrs.org/Publications/DR/DR23.2.pdf/Great.Oboes.pdf

A few years ago, all the sax players at FSU, studying with Gary Campbell, were playing on Selmer HR mouthpieces with a big gouge taken out, just behind the tip rail.  These were very, very advanced players.  This style piece played somewhat on the dark side, a dry sound, but full (actually, they felt it was a fuller sound than any other), and was still very responsive.  Like Joe Henderson.  This sort of makes sense though (back to Ferron&#39;s theory), as, due to the low angle of the baffle at the tip, the wave reflections will just spatter back and forth, causing a lot of resistance.  If you get rid of those reflections completely, you get a somewhat darker, but very responsive and full sound.


Diverse info:

I went over to see Wolfe Tanninbaum the other day - he lives just down the street almost.  We were looking at a copy of his last article in The Saxophone Journal, where he explains why he likes to make the table a little bit concave.  I asked him if the concave tables one finds on machined mouthpieces was intentional or a result of the contraction of the material after machining.  He responded matter-of-factly that it was intentional. 

Wolfe pointed at a mouthpiece cross-sectional diagram, indicating the bore discrepancy between the back bore and the neck opening.  "This, of course, should not be here." he said.  I took that to mean, that he felt the chamber exit should be the same diameter as the neck tube.

And if you asked him why, I&#39;ll bet he says something about air turbulence being a problem.  I do not think turbulence exists there (just laminar recirculation) nor that it is an acoustic problem.  There have been several attempts to make "Smoothbore" mouthpieces.  They work, but not better or worse than others.  

So how important is the requirement for a constriction?  It does not seem like a big deal.  Same as with mouthpiece volume.  You just need to be in the ballpark.  Pushing in/out makes some adjustment to get it "right".  Different players&#39; embouchures need different volumes too.  Play loose, push in.  The missing cone volume calc did not change.  Benade did some analysis of the air column with the player considered as part of the system.

So, can anyone give a ballpark number for what that volume would be for, say, a tenor mouthpiece?  Or alto/bari/soprano?
&lt;&lt;&lt;

I did some measurements years ago when I first read Ferron.  He just presented neck tapers (I think) so that is what I measured on my saxes.

Missing cone volumes:
Tenor 60&#39;s 10M = 10.2 ml
YAS-62 = 8.5
Ponzol neck for alto = 9.1
Buescher C-mel = 14.7
YBS-52 = 17.7
Conn straight Bb sop = 2.2
Buescher straight C sop = 2.6

My actual mouthpiece volumes where tuned at the time were:
Tenor Quantum = 12.4 ml
Tenor Strathon = 11.6
Alto Runyon Custom = 8.0
Alto Meyer = 8.3
Bari Quantum = 16.6
Bari RPC 110 = 15.7
Bari RPC 125 = 16.3
Bb sop Runyon Custom = 3.8
C sop customized lg chamber = 4.3

So I got different results from my vintage tenor and sops vs the newer Yamahas.  The Yamaha calcs say I should pull out more and the Conn calcs say I should push in (WTF?).  The results were only ballpark at the time so I gave up on trying to make use of them.  Maybe if I take the body taper into account, I can explain some of the differences (or it may make it worse!).

            <pre class='message__body'>I believe it has been tried but has never really
successfully because of the complexity of what is
happening in that small space. That paper I cited talks
about vortex shedding and flow reattachment with the walls
and esoteric-sounding things like the "Coanda effect" and
the "vena-contracta factor". To make things worse there is
apparently no good model of how the lateral slits should
be figured when calculating the reed channel width. 

Even if that were clear, there remains a lot of work to be
done to obtain a reliable model for the relationship
between the jet height (hj) and the reed channel height
(hr), as this determines which of two possible types of
reed channel flow is present under steady flow conditions.

To further complicate matters, steady flow models don&#39;t
seem to work, and the authors say that they suspect that
the unsteadiness of the flow is an essential feature, but
exactly how and why is still not really understood. They
say: "Gilbert, using the set-up designed by Meynial, was
not able in dynamical measurements of the flux theta to
observe a transition between the fully separated jet flow
regime and the reattached jet flow regime. The data of
Gilbert indicate that the best we can do in a simplified
theory is to assume a constant vena contracta factor
alpha. Unfortunately the dynamic data of Gilbert are
unreliable for Lr/hr>10. As we expect in analogy with
voiced sound production that the final phase of reed
closing (hr->0) is crucial for the generation of higher
harmonics, this lack of reliable data is a problem. We may
conclude that unless better dynamical data are available
one should not use a complex model. This would justify the
type of reed flow equations proposed by Fletcher and
Rossing using equation (1) with modified exponents for hj
and (pm-p(0)). We should realize that these exponents do
not have any simple physical meaning nor universal value.
They are fit parameters only."

There is a lot that is fairly well understood about
musical acoustics, but there remains a lot more that is
still a complete mystery, at least in substantive terms.

So you&#39;ve got your work cut out for you ;^)

            <pre class='message__body'>The paper I cited has an exact explanation of what the
cavity behind the tip rail improves attack response, and
it apparently has nothing to do with Ferron and everything
to do with flow in the reed channel based on Bernoulli
forces. It is much too complicated to quote here, but very
interesting. See the top of page C5-562.

It starts: "A Bernoulli force FB(hr) which depends only on
the reed channel aperture hr is not able, under steady
oscillation conditions, to transfer energy from the flow
to the reed oscillation because for a periodic reed
movement (sigma?)Fbdhr = 0..."

...and gets worse from there. But apart from the math it
says some interesting things. And in addition to referring
to "typical Strouhal numbers" it even has some pictures
for folks like me :-)

Thanks for the ideas guys.  This is going to be my tenor solution, I can tell already.  Modern Link STM 7, facing balanced by Wolfe T.  Ever so slight amount of 95/5 fused just behind the tip rail so I can contour the short roll-over baffle the way I want as one solid metal piece.  Excavated very large chamber and side walls.  Side walls rounded up to the tip.  The window reduced in size slightly by adding  a flat oval shaped brass piece in the bottom of the window which extends the ramp somewhat.  The curve of the bottom of the window now mirrors the curve of the tip rail exactly.  Though the table wall is not that thick in the front (at the ramp) I still angled the extended ramp exactly parallel to the baffle.  The excavation is not quite complete, but at this point I have a 1/4" cylindrical brass neck (constriction) extension, shoved into the shank.  The sound and response is very, very nice.  The tuning of the registers is accurate and very stable.  I will use various thickness tuning rings to compensate for temperature fluctuations, etc.   Everything is done by feel now.  No measurements have been taken.

it works as any other conservation law plus exceptions. It is a good starting point, a first approximation. Anyway the player-mouthpiece-saxophone-air interactions should be also considered. I think the only way to see some result is to solve numerically a proper set of differential equations. The cavity shape can be approximated very well by using small meshes. It is not exactly my field of research but if I will find a bit of free time (almost impossible) I will try to model a mouthpiece and post the results here.
The program I use is called COMSOL maybe someone here knows how to use it better than me :). If you have any idea I am ready to try it.

May I suggest that you read the part of Scavone&#39;s thesis
on single-reed mpcs before you begin?

The paper I quoted on the musical aero-acoustics of the
clarinet, from which I quoted, is by far the most complete
treatment on the mpc that I have ever seen, and is way
beyond me. However it might make more sense to you.

You can easily find both by googling "Scavone thesis" and
"musical aero-acoustics clarinet"

Most consider "stock" as the mouthpiece that comes free with the sax.  But you are probably looking for a relatively low cost factory-made MP.

I presume you are looking for the widest interior chamber in the throat area?  I would say it is the Link STM NY.

Do we all here have the Wyman thesis on mouthpieces? Not
too scientific, but full of excellent empirical research
and good measurements.

Steve Goodson was kind enough to send it to me a while
ago, and I would be happy to send it along to whoever
wants it or upload it if someone tells me where.

I don&#39;t know.  You said it Mojo, "Experimentation leads the way and the theory lags behind."  The artists lead the way by demonstration and the theorists try to describe.   We don&#39;t need cutting edge mathematical descriptions of what we already know from experience.  I don&#39;t need conditional modeling equations to tell me that I like the way a certain mouthpiece responds to how I raise my tongue in the back of my throat, or what it does when I open my soft pallet and sinus cavities by pushing my jaw forward until the joints crack, or how it responds to my just sliding my tongue off the reed at various different angles.  We already know these things.  The theorists are arguing about how best to describe them IF they know about them at all.  But, more power to them, as when they are able to model every physical aspect of every saxophone design and how it responds to the infinite variations of human anatomy, and I mean EVERY aspect at the level of every artist in the medium, both in tactile and acoustic terms, then we will all be playing computers running acoustic algorithms.

I just listened to Larry Potter on youtube.  Phenominal player.  He&#39;s playing a Selmer SBA I think and a Theo Wanne mouthpiece.  It sounds great.  What I noticed is, that he apparently just figured out how to sound like Stanley Turrentine.  In certain parts of his solos, he attacks and shapes the notes exactly like Stanley would have. I don&#39;t think the instrument modelers are even light years away from noticing much less describing these kind of differences.   All I can tell you is, it has a lot to do with using a brown box Rico reed on a Link chambered mouthpiece.

Until then, and I imagine that this realization is still a few generations off, what we need are general acoustic guidelines so we can understand AS PERFORMERS or mouthpiece designers how the excitation system functions in an acoustic instrument system and how that applies to the player, not necessarily what it means to the academic or scientific community.

So, if we have specific questions, in this day of computer interconnectivity, we can easily direct them towards those at the forefront of scientific academic acoustical analysis and documentation.  It does not guarantee however, that they have even begun to analyze or even consider analyzing the object of our concern as performers or designers.

Not so much specifically on the sax, but quite a bit on
woodwinds and nonlinearities, of which the reed is a major
one.

            <pre class='message__body'>For me the theory and the hands-on should be
complementary. Obviously the physical modeling is always
going to be imperfect, but it can provide us with some
guidelines so that we don&#39;t waste a lot of effort going in
fruitless directions. 

A useful analogy for me is that theory is like a map. It
certainly can never possess the detail or actuality of
being there, but it gives a useful overview of the roads
that we cannot perhaps see through the trees, and by
comparing where we are with the poor representation of
that point on the map, we can plot a route for where we
hope to go, without getting lost in a lot of cul-de-sacs
and dead ends.

We already have a number of different mouthpiece designs that function well and it becomes a matter of the personal choice or tastes of the player selecting from available models. Mouthpiece design has evolved more by practical experimentation than adherence to theory with the early large chambered, round sidewalls with concave baffle original design of Aldolphe Sax being the closest to the missing cone theory.

            <pre class='message__body'>That also is a matter for debate and taste.  Look at the square chambered Selmer S80, the biggest selling mouthpiece ever. Considered and used by very many classical players and very far removed from the original Adolphe Sax design.

Not quite finished with it yet.  The baffle tip is still a bit rough and I have some more sidewall to remove on one side, but the pitch had dropped a lot due to the enlargement already made.  What Paul says about the huge chamber and intonation is true, but, you can compensate nicely by lengthening the constriction cylindrically (the end of the neck).  The ramp extension also helps noticeably to stabilize the intonation.  My theory:  The space at the end of the window is a useless bore perturbation, causing the associated intonation shifts to the various harmonic resonance modes proportional to their wave length, as this is a pressure anti-node for all modes.  The reed does not vibrate there since the break is about 1/4" in front of it.  That chamber volume is not needed since the chamber has been excavated massively at more strategic locations.  That space is not needed for increased flow since it does not go anywhere.  It is more an eddy causing obstruction because the ramp usually ends there abruptly.  Extend the ramp until there is no obstruction (in the middle, there will still be a bump on the sides, unless the ramp is made flat, which I have not tried yet.)  The ramp should be angled parallel to the baffle as it is on nice clarinet mouthpieces.

Have any of you actually done this?  Constructed mouthpieces with short, fat chambers vs long tapered chambers?



I have.  This is what happens.  



Start with a mouthpiece that plays well in tune, the palm keys play in tune relative to the rest of the instrument, etc.  Such a mouthpiece would have a "medium" chamber... and this would be regardless of baffle, etc.  



Use a bit close to the "bore" size and go in from the shank or butt end, and extend the bore into the chamber area.  Let me say here, any bore exposed past the end of the neck is part of chamber volume.



Now get out the Dremel tool and start carving away sidewalls, and grinding away what you can reach from the window.



What you end up with is something similar to the old Buescher, Conn, Caravan, Rasher, etc mouthpiece type.  



No matter how much material you remove, in order to tune up with the usual tuning notes, you have to push the mouthpiece onto the cork (now very far onto the cork) so that the volume past the end of the neck is equal to the missing conical section.  



Play the mouthpiece.. . what happens?  It is reasonably in tune over most of the range, but when you begin to play on the short end of the tube, the palm key notes, it is very sharp.  The mouthpiece is now too short, though the volume is correct.  



It seems that the low register, with the way the nodes and antinodes lie, it tunes by mouthpiece volume.



But the upper register tunes by length, too.



OK, let&#39;s go the opposite way... let&#39;s get out the putty and start filling in, making a long narrow "pea shooter" mouthpiece.  Put it on the cork and tune up.  Now you have to pull out, to gain volume inside, so that once again the volume past the end of the neck is equal to the missing conical section.  You have the regular tuning note well tuned, but the mouthpiece is barely hanging onto the end of the neck cork.



Play the instrument and you will see that when you get to the short end of the tube, the palm key notes are... flat!  The mouthpiece is too long, though the volume is correct.



I&#39;ve been through this process in experimenting with bass sax, soprano sax, and tenor sax mouthpieces, noting tuning tendencies.  I had even constructed a soprano sax mouthpiece with removable inserts of various length (inserted into the bore, shoved up to the throat area) to change volume and length relationship.  I still have that mouthpiece around somewhere, but in the end I glued in the best insert.



If anyone would like to experiment with this, I suggest getting 3 Runyon Model 22 alto or tenor mouthpieces.  I can get a basic unmarked but faced mouthpiece for you quite cheaply.  Leave one unmodified.  Fill in the baffle, chamber, and throat on one.  Hog out the other one with your Dremel tool.  Check the results for yourself.



In the end, like Goldilocks, the mouthpiece must be neither too hot, nor too cold, nor too hard, nor too soft... it must be "just right".



Paul

Well, you&#39;ve quoted what I had said about all this.  (I left it below)

What I posted (below) is exactly what happens with, for example, the big chambered Links.  

So, why are some old saxes better in tune with mouthpieces that just don&#39;t work well with modern saxes, and vise versa?  

Well, for one, there is only a limited portion (D1/D2 up to C#2/C#3) that is played in two registers.  From C#1 on down to Bb1, that portion is only played in the low register, and in fact, the bore/tone holes are optimized for that range.

On the top end, from the D3 palm key on up, that range is only played in the upper register, and the tone hole placement is optimized for those notes.

If the apex end of the cone were to be cut at a slightly different point, and a different size/chamber volume mouthpiece were required, the instrument would have to be made to work well with that arrangment.

OK, so the palm key notes can be set up to work correctly with a range of mouthpieces, apex missing volumes, etc.

The note that can&#39;t is the pesky open C#.  So this is the one to focus on.  Find the mouthpiece volume/chamber length that (a) plays the C2 tuning note (concert Bb for tenor, concert Eb for alto/bari)... yes, I said concert Eb for alto/bari.  I did not misspeak.  Find the mouthpiece volume that plays in tune AND plays C#2/C#3 with no flatness of C#2, and no sharpness of C#3.

If you chose to modifiy the present mouthpiece, rather than experiment with different mouthpieces, then you must adjust the length of the chamber at the throat. 

If you chose to adjust the mouthpiece to be optimum for your instrument:

If the C#2 is flat, C#3 is sharp, then you must make a "tuning ring" to place in the bore and shove up just behind the throat.  You will find that you have to pull out slighly now, to tune to the tuning note.  This change has the effect of making the mouthpiece longer, while maintaining volume the same.

If instead you find that the C#2 is sharp, or the C#3 is flat (more likely), then you must drill, from the bore end, the back of the throat, in effect lengthening the bore.  This change has the effect of making the mouthpiece shorter, while maintaining volume the same.

Now, how do I fix Links?  First, I fill in the hollowed out sidewalls with epoxy putty, smooth it and let it harden.  This continues back to about 1/8" past the back of the window. I can&#39;t say throat because the Link does not have a throat. But where the throat would be on any other mouthpiece.  But that is not enough.

Beginning about 3/8" back (about 1 cm) from the tip, I add material to the roof of the chamber back to just past the window.  It begins very thin toward the tip, and is about 1/8" thick (3.5 mm) on the bore end.  

The mouthpiece then plays better in tune, has a more focused tone, less "tubby" sounding.  And it is no longer a Link, but my customers are happy with the way it plays.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks.  Yes, the saxophone is based upon a cone that produces the D scale - D1 to C#2, the second octave obtained from the same tone holes by overblowing the first.  The notes above and below are just added on, each with it &#39;s own dedicated tone hole.  The lucky notes.

Very interesting and helpful - focusing on the C# as the point of reference for adjustments. 

"If instead you find that the C#2 is sharp, or the C#3 is flat (more
likely), then you must drill, from the bore end, the back of the
throat, in effect lengthening the bore. This change has the effect of
making the mouthpiece shorter, while maintaining volume the same."

In other words:  You are making the chamber volume larger. You push in more so that the neck displaces the amount of volume you just added, so the mouthpiece is effectively shorter and the volume remains the same.

Well, you&#39;ve quoted what I had said about all this.  (I left it below)



What I posted (below) is exactly what happens with, for example, the big chambered Links.  



So, why are some old saxes better in tune with mouthpieces that just don&#39;t work well with modern saxes, and vise versa?  



Well, for one, there is only a limited portion (D1/D2 up to C#2/C#3) that is played in two registers.  From C#1 on down to Bb1, that portion is only played in the low register, and in fact, the bore/tone holes are optimized for that range.



On the top end, from the D3 palm key on up, that range is only played in the upper register, and the tone hole placement is optimized for those notes.



If the apex end of the cone were to be cut at a slightly different point, and a different size/chamber volume mouthpiece were required, the instrument would have to be made to work well with that arrangment.



OK, so the palm key notes can be set up to work correctly with a range of mouthpieces, apex missing volumes, etc.



The note that can&#39;t is the pesky open C#.  So this is the one to focus on.  Find the mouthpiece volume/chamber length that (a) plays the C2 tuning note (concert Bb for tenor, concert Eb for alto/bari).. . yes, I said concert Eb for alto/bari.  I did not misspeak.  Find the mouthpiece volume that plays in tune AND plays C#2/C#3 with no flatness of C#2, and no sharpness of C#3.

            <pre class='message__body'>I looked into that one a few months ago.  I&#39;m skeptical about the accuracy possible in such a flimsy machine, and didn&#39;t see enough technical specs about it or the plastics they sell for it either.  

Still, I have found 3d printing pretty efficient for prototyping.  Machines suitable for real work are still 5 figures but there are several companies that will print things for you.  I couldn&#39;t get anything that looks good enough for cheap enough for production, but for prototyping it has saved me a lot of CAM programming and machine time.
