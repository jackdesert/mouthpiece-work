            <pre class='message__body'>Hi All,

I have a Patricola Rosewood clarinet which I totally love. Unfortunately black mouthpieces aren&#39;t the nicest looking mouthpieces in the world so I use either Crystal or clear plastic (Runyon).

My quandary is this. I like Crystal mouthpieces. They seem to have a different tone than the plastic ones however I now own about 5 crystal mouthpieces from a Selmer to Pomarico as well as an antique Marius Fossenkemper made by O&#39;Brien back in the 60&#39;s or so. I don&#39;t think it is a one of a kind. I think it was a line of mouthpieces that O&#39;Brien made under his name.

I have been trying out different openings on the Runyon model 22 Clear plastic ones with their largest opening and they&#39;ve cut open two of them for me that seems to be really close to what I want.  

I remember talking via email to some company in south New Jersey about cutting down the Crystal mouthpiece&#39;s for me and they said they can do it. But I can&#39;t for the life of me remember the name of the company. 

Can anyone on this group tell me if there are companies that will shave the opening of my crystal mouthpiece for me?

BTW you can see my Patricola at http://www.newjerseywindtrio.com. 

Thanks in advance,

Steve
