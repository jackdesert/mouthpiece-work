            <pre class='message__body'>The baffle is the area just behind the tip rail.  Your mouthpiece likely has a "high baffle", that is, it is close to the reed at that area.  CAREFULLY file the area just behind the tip rail to make more space between the reed and baffle, that is, increase the angle of the baffle.
   
  This will darken the tone and increase resistance slightly.

The phrase: "darken the serious"  does not make sense in English.

            <pre class='message__body'>in french, &#39;serious&#39; translates to &#39;grave&#39; but grave in french also
means &#39;low&#39; or &#39;bass&#39; when talking about sound, so I think he meant to
say, "how can i darken the lower register"...

some phrases just don&#39;t translate easily!

To clarify, I have posted a drawing in the Files section.

If you want to darken the low notes.  You need to open up the chamber/throat area and the baffle away from the tip rail.  Lowering the baffle near the tip rail, as shown in Paul&#39;s sketch, will mostly darken the high and mid range notes.
