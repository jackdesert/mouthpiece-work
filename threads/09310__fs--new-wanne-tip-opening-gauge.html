            <pre class='message__body'>This is a new facing gauge from Theo Wanne and includes the optional tip. The whole thing costs $110 on Theo&#39;s site but I&#39;ll take $75 + shipping. I&#39;ve barely used this since I have my own tool that I prefer. $8.00 for domestic shipping or $30.00 for international express shipping. Here&#39;s what Theo&#39;s site says about this tool:

Our dial gauge is straight forward, accurate, and economical. 

A Tip Gauge measures the tip opening (distance between the reed and the tip rail of the mouthpiece) for all woodwind mouthpieces. 

The gauge body is made from gold anodized solid billet aluminum milled flat for accuracy.
