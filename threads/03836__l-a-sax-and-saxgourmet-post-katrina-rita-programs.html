            <pre class='message__body'>We&#39;re going to wind up the L.A. Sax Katrina/Rita relief program on November
30, along with the Steve Goodson Woodwinds Katrina/Rita repair program. Full
details of the programs are at www.saxgourmet.com
&lt;http://www.saxgourmet.com/> .

 

We have had a tremendous response to these programs, and are glad that we
were able to offer some assistance to those who suffered significant losses.
We got quite a few donations from friends, customers, vendors, and even a
few competitors, and 100% of those funds went to help with the discount
repair program.

 

As we begin the construction process, we will not be keeping anything like
normal business hours. An exterior wall has to be totally removed and then
replaced, along with lots of other stuff. We&#39;ll be staying out of the way of
the contractors when asked to do so. As always, if you wish to see us, MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT FIRST.

 

I&#39;ll be making lots of appearances in the next few months on behalf of  

 L. A. Sax, including the IAJE and NAMM shows. I&#39;ll also be visiting with
some of our dealers to introduce the new Steve Goodson Model.

 

Production has started on our new line of mouthpieces. Watch for quite a few
new products in the coming months.

 

This has been an extremely difficult time for us. Sharon and I want you to
know how much we appreciate your many messages of support.

hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
