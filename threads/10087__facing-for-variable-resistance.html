For a given horn, I prefer low resistance in the low notes and a higher resistance as one goes up to the palm keys. Are there any facings that would facilitate this? Or is this primarily a reed strength thing?

Do you find this (long facing + ellipse = easy low end, more resistant high)
to be equally true on all the horns, or is the effect more pronounced on some
(sop- alto-tnr-bari)?

I was thinking along the same line. Like Dan, I would be curious if this is consistent thru SATB.  What sort of AB elliptical ratios would be ideal? And could you elaborate the part on "to a point" ?

            <pre class='message__body'>As for "to a point" it depends on what your goals on as to whether a facing curve is going to do it for you or not.  Like everything else pertaining to a mouthpiece design there is only so much you can do and the rest is up to the player.  If a player wants a brighter mouthpiece, and you keep raising the baffle, soon it will not play at all.  Same thing with tip openings.  If someone wants a large tip opening there is always a point where they should stop going larger.
 
I find the size of sax and what is expected to be played on each sax does influence my choice of facing curves.  Tip openings do too.  I tend to use more resistant curves with smaller tip openings.  Smaller saxes do better with more resistant curves than larger saxes IMO.
 
A good baseline is a 3-4 aspect ratio ellipse for alto and tenor mouthpieces.  For tenors, I had been using 50-52 lengths, but lately I am doing more 48-50s.  
 
I have a lot of variation in the facing curve targets I use.  It is more important to construct a precise curve IMO than target for a specific curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Thanks, Keith. I had done several elliptical curves on alto and tenor pieces
and found that I liked them very much on alto (even w/ higher aspect ratios)
but much less on tenor. And, yes, assessing the differences is meaningless
unless the curves are executed with great accuracy.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,
Thanks again for sharing your thoughts. What about bari ? I find that upper registers are more stable if there is some resistance to push against but of course, we also want the low to respond easily.
I do agree that getting a smooth curve is more important.

            <pre class='message__body'>On bari I personally get along fine with a radial curve (close to a stock Runyon).  I just use a slightly stiffer (Fibracell) reed when I want more resistance on the palm keys.  The lower end is still easy to get but takes a little more work.  Maybe I would like some ellipse but I really "know" this MP as it is.
