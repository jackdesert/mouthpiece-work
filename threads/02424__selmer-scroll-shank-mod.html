Hi, I&#39;m sort of new to this group and I have a question. I play alto 
(selmer balanced action circa 1941) on a meyer 6m and along with the 
horn came a selmer mpc (metal) C**, "scroll shank". This mpc is very 
closed and, apparently, good for classical playing but I would like 
a little more volume and high end. 
Are there any obvious mods I should try (besides opening it a bit?)

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>As it is opened, the tip rail will get wider.  From this you can create a
roll-over baffle that will give you a little extra zing.

Thanks for your reply, Keith. The mpc has some sublte (very) 
rollover already. As you say, opening it up would widen the tip rail 
a bit, but how large should the rollover baffle be to make a 
noticeable change in sound? It seem I would gain very little room to 
make it. 
Sorry to bother you with my newbie questions!

To make a significant difference, you will need to open it .006" (for 
an alto MP).  Anything less is just a fine adjustment.  So you should 
try something in the .006"-.010" range larger.  Just blend in the 
rollover as you create a new tip rail and see if it gets bright 
enough for your liking.  If not, this may not be the piece for you.  
You can try some baffles in it or look for a piece that already has a 
baffle.

Now this open/roll-over advise assumes you have the proper guages and 
know-how to create a facing curve for the more open tip.  If not, 
practice on some other pieces before messing up your metal Selmer.

            <pre class='message__body'>If the facing is good (and many are not on the Selmers) the metal 
Selmers will perform well for classical, and C** and D are my preferred 
facings for that purpose.  But only opening the tip opening will more 
power and volume. 
 
But when the tip is opened, naturally, the baffle becomes closer to the 
reed.  This gives more material to work with in creating a baffle shape 
that will give more projection.
 
If you were to open the tip opening to .075"-.080" (D, 1.90mm to E, 
2.00mm) and then remove only the minimum amount of baffle necessary to 
create a nice tip rail, you could give the mouthpiece a good, bright, 
projecting tone.
 
MOST jazz alto players, such as for big band lead alto work, play 
mouthpieces in this range, .075"-.080" (1.90 - 2.00 mm), with very few 
using mouthpieces outside of this range.  (Rock/R&B players tend to use 
larger, and classical players, smaller tip openings than this range)
 
One thing I like about the metal Selmers is the nice round throat, the 
rear part of the chamber, that focuses the air into the neck of the 
saxophone.

Thanks Keith and Paul for your advice. I think I will give it a try 
with my local luthier&#39;s assistance.

This will be interesting:

luthier

n : a craftsman who makes stringed instruments (as lutes or guitars 
or violins)

Ha Ha! It&#39;s true! In Spansih (at least in Argentina) we use the word 
luthier to refer to anybody dealing with the craft of repairing or 
modifying any musical instruments (even outside the "lute" family). 
This particular "luthier" has done refacing work before and he&#39;s 
retty much my only choice within a radius of 500Km (how many miles?)
