            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Phil Barone blank of his "Limited Edition" Hollywood 
mouthpiece. Would anyone hear be capable of finishing this mouthpiece 
for me. Please let me know.

Also, on the same note are there any suggestions as to how I should 
approach  finishing the mouthpiece. I look forward to hearing all of 
your ideas.

Thank you,
Herschel McWilliams
