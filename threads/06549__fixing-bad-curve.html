            <pre class='message__body'>I have an Otto Link 8 metal that I wanted to reface because I never
liked the response. It turns out that the curve near the break takes a
sudden dip. The readings using the 50 and 65 feeler gauge are just too
big. I got this piece used so I don&#39;t know if it was made this way or
accidentally or intentionally changed by the former owner. It did not
appear to have wear marks when i first looked at it.
   What are my options? I don&#39;t really want to go to a bigger opening
than an 8. The way it is now I would have to make it at least a 10.
Should I try to cut the table down until the 50 and 65 are on the
curve, and then open up the other readings until they are back in line?
  Are there any other solutions? I feel it would be a great piece if I
could get this part of the  curve back in line.   Thank you.
  Peter Deley

            <pre class='message__body'>I would take the table down until the dip meets regulation size for 
your size 8 then reface the rest of the curve to meet the same size 8 
specs. You will probably get a slightly more modern sound as the baffle 
will now be higher.

  Thank you Ross. That is what I thought I had to do, and I was
concerned about raising the baffle too much in doing this. Peter
