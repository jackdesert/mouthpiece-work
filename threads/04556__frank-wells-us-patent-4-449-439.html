Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
It is well known to those skilled in the art of musical instruments that
virtually all musical instruments, including brass instruments as well as
woodwind instruments, require a mouthpiece which is usually removably
mounted onto the instrument incident to the playing thereof. It is further
well known that the tonal qualities and characteristics of any instrument
are integrally dependent upon the shape, construction, and configuration of
the mouthpiece, regardless of the type of instrument involved.
This is especially true in connection with woodwind instruments, wherein the
mouthpiece is designed to accommodate a wood reed which is removably mounted
to the mouthpiece, since the tonal characteristics of the instrument will
then be directly dependent not only upon the construction of the mouthpiece,
but also the quality and character of the reed affixed thereto. In this
connection, specific reference is made to instruments such as clarinets and
saxophones. The typical mouthpiece for such instruments is constructed in
the form of a unitary element which includes a collar end for engaging the
instrument neck, which is usually fitted with a cork barrel such that the
instrument may be frictionally engaged thereon. The opposed end of the
mouthpiece includes a mouth biting portion which is constructed to have an
inclined surface along the top portion thereof, and a horizontally flattened
surface along the lower portion thereof. The horizontally flattened lower
surface is designed to accommodate the reed thereon which is maintained in
position, typically, by a metal screw collar. The mouthpiece is hollow
throughout, such that a wind channel is created traversing the entire barrel
of the mouthpiece. The lower horizontally flattened surface of the
mouthpiece further includes a slot which is cut out therein and which
extends from the tip end of the mouthpiece inwardly for a distance in the
direction of the collar end of mouthpiece. Typically, the slotted cut-out
section is bounded by opposed side edges which extend from the tip end of
the mouthpiece on a slight angle inwardly to a rounded intersection, and
traverses approximately no greater than between 30% and 35% of the overall
length of the mouthpiece.
It is known that the manner in which a woodwind instrument such as a
clarinet or saxophone will produce certain tonal characteristics relates to
the fact that the instrument itself contains a column of air internally of
the instrument. The length of the column of air in the instrument is varied
by the operator opening or closing various of the keys located on the
instrument. Hence, different tones along the scale may be produced thereby.
When the operator plays the instrument, air is forced through the mouthpiece
into the instrument thereby affecting the air column contained therein. It
is further known that air will pass into the mouthpiece from the operator&#39;s
mouth in vibrating fashion, or in other words, as the operator blows into
the instrument, air enters through the reed in a vibrational form. In some
ranges of the instrument, for example, air will pass into the instrument at
the rate of 440 puffs of air per second. It is further known that the reason
for the construction and configuration of the wind channel in the mouthpiece
is to control and direct the air vibrations as they pass into the instrument
in order to produce the tonal sounds from the instrument. In this
connection, it is known that at the high end of the tone range, a relatively
small amount of air is necessary to pass through the reed since the reed
need only vibrate a small amount in order to formulate the note. At the
lower end of the tone register, substantially more air is necessary, since
the reed will vibrate at a much slower rate in order to create the note.
Therefore, it is known that each note will be sounded based upon the number
of vibrations of the reed per second of time. It is further known that as
one increases the octave on the instrument, that is, moves to a higher
octave, the vibration rate necessary for the reed is doubled for each
octave.
It has been found, however, that it is extremely difficult to design a
mouthpiece, especially for a wood wind instrument, which permits the
operator to have full and brilliant tone qualities at both the low end and
the high end of the tonal register of the instrument. In short, when the
operator changes his embouchure and the velocity of the wind entering the
instrument in order to move from lower to higher registers in the tone and
note range, it is difficult for the wind channel in the mouthpiece to
accommodate the changes in wind velocity traversing the mouthpiece and
entering into the instrument, while still maintaining a steady flow of air
into the instrument such that the column of air maintained in the instrument
will not be violently disturbed. As indicated previously, if the air column
contained within the instrument receives a series of severe vibrational
pulses, the column is disrupted, and this has the tendency to distort the
tonal characteristics of each of the notes as they are played.
OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES
It is therefore the principal object of the present invention to provide an
improved mouthpiece construction especially adapted for a woodwind
instrument, which is constructed to include a wind compression chamber
formed in the wind channel which has the effect of smoothing out the air
vibrational pulses as the same travel through the mouthpiece and into the
instrument thereby to eliminate any sudden or violent air vibrational forces
from disrupting the column of air located in the instrument.
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved mouthpiece
for a woodwind instrument which further includes a slotted cut-out section
bounded by opposed side edges formed in the horizontally flattened portion
of the mouthpiece along the lower portion thereof, the slotted cut-out
section extending from the tip end of the mouthpiece inwardly for a distance
in the direction of the collar end and terminating in a circular inner end,
the slotted cut-out section having key slot configuration formed by a pair
of opposed curvilinear flanges extending inwardly from the opposed side
edges thereof for a portion of the distance between the tip end and the
circular inner end, the curvilinear flanges having a thickness which is less
than the diameter of the wind channel thereby to create a wind compression
chamber formed in the wind channel and extending for a distance along the
wind channel.
In conjunction with the foregoing object, it is a further object of the
invention to provide a woodwind mouthpiece of the type described wherein the
slotted cut-out section has a length which extends from the tip end of the
mouthpiece inwardly for approximately 40% or less of the overall length of
the mouthpiece.
In conjunction with the foregoing objects, it is still a further object of
the invention to provide an improved mouthpiece of the type described
wherein the curvilinear flanges have a thickness sufficient to reduce the
overall diameter of the wind channel by between 25% and 50% thereof and
extend for a distance of approximately 60% of the length of the slotted
cut-out section inwardly from the tip end of the mouthpiece.
Still a further object of the invention is to provide an improved woodwind
mouthpiece of the type described, wherein the inclined surface forming the
top portion of the mouthpiece includes an undersurface which forms the roof
of the wind channel of the mouthpiece, the roof having a thickened portion
extending over the curvilinear flanges, which together create a wind
compression chamber which has a diameter of the between 25% and 50% less
than the diameter of the wind channel.
Further features of the invention pertain to the particular arrangement of
the elements and parts whereby the above-outlined and additional operating
features are attained.
The invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together
with further object and advantages thereof will best be understood by
reference to the following specification, taken in connection with the
accompanying drawings.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
In summary, the present invention provides an improved mouthpiece for a
woodwind instrument wherein the mouthpiece, which typically includes a
collar end for engaging an instrument neck at one end, and a mouth engaging
portion at the opposed end thereof extending from the tip end inwardly for a
distance in the direction of the collar end, the mouth engaging portion
having an upper inclined surface along the top portion thereof and a
horizontally flattened surface along the lower portion thereof for
supporting a reed thereon, and a wind channel traversing the entire length
of the mouthpiece, the improvement being formed by a slotted cut-out section
bounded by opposed side edges formed in the horizontally flattened surface
along the lower portion thereof, the slotted cut-out section extending from
the tip end of the mouthpiece inwardly for a distance in the direction of
the collar end and terminating in a circular inner end, and the slotted
cut-out section having a key slot configuration formed by a pair of opposed
curvilinear flanges extending inwardly from the opposed side edges of the
slotted cut-out section for a portion of the distance between the tip end
and the circular inner end, and the curvilinear flanges having a thickness
sufficient to reduce the diameter of the wind channel for a portion along
the length thereof thereby to create a wind compression chamber within the
wind channel in order to regulate the vibrational pulse rate of air as it
traverses the mouthpiece. The configuration of the structure of the
mouthpiece as set forth above, as indicated, will create a wind compression
area in a portion of the mouthpiece adjacent to the tip end, and has the
effect of smoothing out the vibrational pulses of air as the same are forced
through the mouthpiece and into the instrument, with the concomitant result
that the column of air maintained in the instrument will only be
imperceptibly disturbed as the air impulses travel into the instrument for
the purpose of creating the notes and the tonal qualities of each of the
notes played by the operator. The result of the construction is to the
effect that the operator is permitted to create bright and brilliant tones
at both the low end of the register of the instrument as well as the upper
register of the instrument thereby to improve the overall tonal
characteristics of the instrument when played.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
With specific reference to FIG. 1 of the drawings, the mouthpiece 10 is
generally indicated. It will be observed that the mouthpiece 10 includes a
collar end 12 which is intended to frictionally engage the neck of an
instrument, such as a clarinet or saxophone. The opposed end of the
mouthpiece 10 includes the tip end 14 which is intended to be the mouth
engaging end of the mouthpiece 10. The mouthpiece 10 is further shown to
include an inclining portion formed along the top surface of the mouthpiece,
generally indicated by the numeral 16 (FIG. 2), and a horizontally flattened
portion along the lower surface of the mouthpiece 10, generally indicated by
the numeral 18. It will be noted that the horizontally flattened portion 18
includes an inclined section 19 adjacent to tip end 14 which functions in
the typical manner for facilitating the mouth engaging function of the
mouthpiece.
Again with reference to FIG. 1, there is shown a slotted cut-out section 20
which extends from the tip end 14 inwardly toward the collar end 12 for a
distance, and terminating in a circular inner end 22. It is well known in
the art that the typical slotted cut-out section of a mouthpiece 10 includes
substantially parallel side edges which extend from the tip end 14 and
terminating in a circular end 22. However, as illustrated in FIG. 1 of the
drawings, the slotted cut-out section 20 is shown to be formed in the
configuration of a key slot, generally indicated by the numeral 24, the key
slot configuration 24 being formed by a pair of opposed curvilinear flanges
26 and 28 respectively. It will be observed that the curvilinear flanges 26
and 28 are carried along the side edges 21 and 23 respectively of the
slotted cut-out section 20.
It is also known that in a typical woodwind mouthpiece, the slotted cut-out
section has an overall length measured from the tip end 14 to the inner
circular end 22 which is approximately 40% or less of the overall length of
the mouthpiece, as measured from tip end 14 to the collar end 12. It has
been found that the ideal length for the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 is
such that the flanges 26 and 28 account for only approximately 60% of the
overall length of the slotted cut-out section 20.
In addition, it has been determined that it is preferable to commence the
curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 at a point approximately inwardly from the tip
end 14 of the mouthpiece 10 a distance of 1/6th of the overall length of the
slotted cut-out section, and to terminate the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28
at a point, again a distance of approximately 1/6th of the overall length of
the slotted cut-out section 20. With reference to FIG. 1 of the drawings, if
the overall length of the slotted cut-out section is denoted by the numeral
30, the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 respectively will commence at a
distance 32 as measured from the tip end 14 of the mouthpiece 10, and at the
opposed end thereof, will terminate at a distance 34 as measured inwardly
from the circular inner end 22 of the mouthpiece 10. It has been found that
the distances denoted by the numerals 32 and 34 are each approximately 1/6th
of the overall length of the distance denoted by the numeral 30.
It will also be observed with reference to FIGS. 1 and 3 of the drawings,
that the internal confines of the mouthpiece 10 include a wind channel 40
which traverses the entire length of the mouthpiece 10, from tip end 14 to
the collar end 12. It is known that wind channel 40 is the passage way
through which air is forced into the mouthpiece 10 and the instrument (not
shown) by the operator thereof, and plays an important role in the manner in
which the pitch and tone characteristics of the notes are achieved by the
operator. As shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 6 of the drawings, the inclined portion
16 formed along the top portion of the mouthpiece 10 has an undersurface 36
which forms the internal confines of the wind channel 40. With specific
reference to FIG. 3 of the drawings, it will be observed that the improved
mouthpiece 10 of the present invention further includes a thickened portion
38 which is positioned to lie immediately above the positioning of the
curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 respectively. It will be appreciated from a
view of FIGS. 3 and 4 of the drawings, that the thickened portion 38, when
taken in conjunction with the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28, will reduce the
overall diameter 39 of the wind channel 40 by a distance equivalent to the
thickness of the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 as well as the thickness of
the thickened portion 38. As shown in FIG. 4 of the drawings, by providing
the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 in conjunction with the thickened portion
38, a wind compression chamber 42 is created along the path of the wind
channel 40, and at a point immediately adjacent to the tip end 14 of the
mouthpiece 10.
As was indicated previously, it has been found that when the operator of the
instrument blows into the mouthpiece, air is forced through the mouthpiece
and into the instrument to which the mouthpiece is attached. However, air
does not pass in a steady stream, but rather, is forced into the mouthpiece
10 in a pulsating manner. Indeed, it has been found that in some ranges of
the instrument, the vibrational pulse rate of the air blown by the operator
into the mouthpiece 10 can be as much 440 pulses per second. Further, as was
previously indicated, an instrument normally carries a column of air in the
tubular portion of the instrument, the column of air being varied in length
by the operator during the playing of the instrument by depressing keys
along the length of the tube of the instrument. It is in this manner that
various notes are created incident to the playing of the instrument. The
tonal characteristics and the pitch characteristics of each of the notes is
affected by the vibrational forces playing against the air column contained
within the instrument. For example, where the player increases the force of
air entering into the instrument from the mouthpiece for added volume, such
that the column of air within the instrument is drastically interfered with,
the pitch and tone characteristics of the notes being played are adversely
affected. It is therefore desirable to smooth out the vibrational pulse rate
of the air as it passes from the mouthpiece into the instrument in order to
eliminate the interference with the air column in the instrument, thereby to
permit the player to have a greater degree of control over the pitch and
tone characteristics of the notes.
With respect to the mouthpiece 10 of the present invention, it has been
found that by providing a wind compression chamber 42 located in the path of
the wind channel 40, and at a point adjacent to the tip end 14 of the
mouthpiece 10, the vibrational pulse rates of the air being forced through
the mouthpiece 10 by the operator when the instrument is played is smoothed
out such that the air entering into the instrument will not seriously
interefere with or disrupt the air column contained within the instrument.
Hence, the provision of a wind compression chamber 42 has been found to have
superior characteristics with regard to the pitch and tone of the
instrument.
In terms of dimensions, it has been found that the wind channel 40 has a
certain diameter 39 (FIG. 3), and that the provision of the curvilinear
flanges 26 and 28, in combination with the thickened portion 38 should
reduce the diameter 39 of the wind channel 40 by between 25% and 50% of that
dimension. Hence, it is contemplated that the diameter of the wind
compression chamber 42 will be anywhere between 25% and 50% of the overall
diameter 39 of the wind channel 40. It is further important that the overall
length of the wind compression channel 42 be relatively short for the reason
that it is necessary to have the wind channel 40 expand beyond the wind
compression chamber 42 in order to accomplish the smoothing out
characteristic of the vibrational pulse rate of the air as it passes through
the wind channel 40. Hence, the overall length of the wind compression
chamber 42 does not exceed the length of the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28
when taken in comparison with the overall length of the slotted cut-out
section 20.
A further important feature relating to the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 is
the fact that as shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings, the flanges 26 and 28 will
lend further support for the reed which is typically laid on the
horizontally flattened section 18 in a manner customarily known in the art.
It is known that when the operator plays the instrument by blowing air
through the mouthpiece 10, the reed will vibrate against the mouthpiece and
it is the vibrational rate of the reed which also has an effect on the
playing of the instrument. It has been found, however, that in a typical
mouthpiece of the type generally known, as the reed vibrates and slaps down
against the horizontally flattened section 18, the reed tends to concave
into the wind channel 40 thereby causing permanent deformation of the reed
with usage. It is for this reason that a wind player is obligated to change
reeds frequently since the concavity of the reed will have an adverse effect
upon the ability to play certain notes, and even more importantly, has an
adverse effect on tone and pitch. It will be observed that by providing the
curvilinear flanges 26 and 28, additional support is provided for the reed,
and this will prevent the reed from concaving through the slotted cut-out
section 20 into the wind channel 40. The concomitant result is that this
structure, that is the provision of the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28,
forces only the tip end of the reed to vibrate and prevents the reed from
concaving through the slotted cut-out section 20 into the wind channel 40,
and requires that the reed vibrate basically at the tip end thereof. This
has been found to be extremely desirable since this sets up a proper reed
vibration which has a direct and immediate effect on improving the tonal
quality of the notes being played.
Hence, it will be appreciated that by providing the curvilinear flanges 26
and 28, along the side edges 21 and 23 of the slotted cut-out section 20,
the structure creates the wind compression chamber 42, as well as providing
additional support for the reed when mounted on the mouthpiece 10, both of
which have an improving effect on the tonal and pitch characteristics of the
notes being played. It will be observed that these structures, including the
curvilinear flanges 26 and 28, as well as the thickened portion 38 formed in
the undersurface 36 of the inclined portion 16 of the mouthpiece 10
positioned adjacent to tip end 14 of the mouthpiece 10 as illustrated. The
importance of this structure resides in the fact that the front chamber of
the mouthpiece 10 is the ultimate deciding factor as to how the instrument
will sound especially in tonal qualities and pitch since the various notes
which can be played, and the tone and pitch characteristics thereof, are
basically decided at the tip end of the mouthpiece 10 in and about the
region where the reed will vibrate. It is therefore desirable to create the
mouthpiece having the curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 as well as the thickened
portion 38 adjacent to the tip end 14 of the mouthpiece 10 as illustrated.
With specific reference to FIG. 6 of the drawings, it will be observed that
as opposed to providing distinct curvilinear flanges 26 and 28 as described,
the structure may be formed in terms of thickened sections 46 and 48
respectively which are chamfered from top to bottom. Hence, as opposed to
having squared off corners forming the confines of the wind compression
chamber 42, the wind compression chamber 42 will simply have a more rounded
off configuration as illustrated in FIG. 6.
It will be appreciated that in accordance with the above description, the
present invention provides an improved mouthpiece construction which
includes a pair of curvilinear flanges carried along the side edges of the
slotted cut-out section for a woodwind mouthpiece in the manner indicated.
In addition, the present invention provides a thickened section along the
undersurface of the roof of the mouthpiece at a point adjacent to the
curvilinear flanges, such that the diameter of the wind channel is reduced
at that point thereby to create a wind compression chamber adjacent to the
tip end of the mouthpiece. As indicated previously, the creation of a wind
compression chamber has the effect of causing back pressure working against
the path of travel of air as it enters into the mouthpiece, which ultimately
has the effect of smoothing out the vibrational pulse rate of air as it
passes through the mouthpiece and into the instrument thereby to create
better tonal and pitch characteristics of the notes being played. In
addition, the provision of the curvilinear flanges along the slotted cut-out
section of the mouthpiece provides additional support for the side edges of
the reed mounted thereon thereby forcing the reed to vibrate substantially
only at the tip end thereof in order to provide the operator with better
control over both tone and pitch of the notes being played. Hence, it will
be observed that in accordance with the invention as described and claimed
hereinafter, all of the above-named objects and advantages have been
accomplished as well as additional objects and advantages as will be
understood to those skilled in the art.
While there has been described what is considered to be at present the
preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be understood that various
modifications may be made therein and it is intended to cover in the
appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and
scope of the invention.

> instrument neck at one end
> and a mouth engaging portion at the opposed end
> thereof extending from the
> tip end of the mouthpiece inwardly for a distance in
> the direction of the
> opposed collar end, the mouth engaging portion
> having an upper inclined
> surface along the top portion thereof and a
> horizontally flattened surface
> along the lower portion thereof, and a wind channel
> traversing the entire
> length of said mouthpiece, the improvement
> comprising in combination,
> a slotted cut-out section bounded by opposed side
> edges formed in said
> horizontally flattened surface along the lower
> portion thereof,
> said slotted cut-out section extending from the tip
> end of said mouthpiece
> inwardly for a distance in the direction of said
> collar end of said
> mouthpiece and terminating in a circular inner end,
> said slotted cut-out section having a key-slot
> configuration formed by a
> pair of opposed curvilinear flanges extending
> inwardly from the opposed side
> edges thereof for a portion of the distance between
> said tip end and said
> circular inner end thereof,
> said curvilinear flanges having a thickness which is
> less than the diameter
> of said wind channel thereby to create a wind
> compression chamber formed in
> said wind channel and extending for a distance along
> the length of said wind
> channel,
> whereby said wind compression chamber formed by said
> opposed curvilinear
> flanges formed in said slotted cut-out section will
> operate to create back
> pressure and have the effect of smoothing out the
> vibrational rate of the
> air as it enters the instrument thereby to improve
> the tonal qualities of
> the instrument throughout the entire tonal range
> thereof.
> 2. The improved mouthpiece as set forth in claim 1
> above, wherein said
> slotted cut-out section has a length which extends
> from said tip end of the
> mouthpiece inwardly for approximately 40% or less,
> of the overall length of
> the said mouthpiece.
> 3. The improved mouthpiece as set forth in claim 1
> above, wherein said
> curvilinear flanges have a thickness sufficient to
> reduce the overall
> diameter of said wind channel by between 25% and 50%
> thereof, and extend for
> a distance of approximately 60% of the length of
> said slotted cut-out
> section inwardly from the tip end thereof.
> 4. The improved mouthpiece as set forth in claim 3
> above, wherein said
> curvilinear flanges commence at a point spaced
> inwardly from said tip end
> measuring approximately 1/6th of the overall length
> of said slotted cut-out
> section, and terminate at a point spaced from said
> circular end of said
> cut-out section measuring approximately 1/6th of the
> overall length of said
> slotted cut-out section.
> 5. The improved mouthpiece as set forth in claim 1
> above, wherein said
> inclined surface positioned along the top portion of
> said mouthpiece
> includes an undersurface which forms the roof of
> said wind channel, said
> roof having a thickened portion extending over said
> curvilinear flanges,
> which together with said curvilinear flanges combine
> to create a wind
> compression chamber which has a diameter of between
> 25% and 50% less than
> the diameter of said wind channel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
> It is well known to those skilled in the art of
> musical instruments that
> virtually all musical instruments, including brass
> instruments as well as
> woodwind instruments, require a mouthpiece which is
> usually removably
> mounted onto the instrument incident to the playing
> thereof. It is further
> well known that the tonal qualities and
> characteristics of any instrument
> are integrally dependent upon the shape,
> construction, and configuration of
> the mouthpiece, regardless of the type of instrument
> involved.
> This is especially true in connection with woodwind
> instruments, wherein the
> mouthpiece is designed to accommodate a wood reed
> which is removably mounted
> to the mouthpiece, since the tonal characteristics
> of the instrument will
> then be directly dependent not only upon the
> construction of the mouthpiece,
> but also the quality and character of the reed
> affixed thereto. In this
> connection, specific reference is made to
> instruments such as clarinets and
> saxophones. The typical mouthpiece for such
> instruments is constructed in
> the form of a unitary element which includes a
> collar end for engaging the
> instrument neck, which is usually fitted with a cork
> barrel such that the
> instrument may be frictionally engaged thereon. The
> opposed end of the
> mouthpiece includes a mouth biting portion which is
> constructed to have an
> inclined surface along the top portion thereof, and
> a horizontally flattened
> surface along the lower portion thereof. The
> horizontally flattened lower
> surface is designed to accommodate the reed thereon
> which is maintained in
> position, typically, by a metal screw collar. The
> mouthpiece is hollow
> throughout, such that a wind channel is created
> traversing the entire barrel
> of the mouthpiece. The lower horizontally flattened
> surface of the
> mouthpiece further includes a slot which is cut out
> therein and which
> extends from the tip end of the mouthpiece inwardly
> for a distance in the
> direction of the collar end of mouthpiece.
> Typically, the slotted cut-out
> section is bounded by opposed side edges which
> extend from the tip end of
> the mouthpiece on a slight angle inwardly to a
> rounded intersection, and
> traverses approximately no greater than between 30%
> and 35% of the overall
> length of the mouthpiece.
> It is known that the manner in which a woodwind

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Bb Clarinet MPC made by Frank Wells.  It is marked Wells in an 
oval with CHICAGO underneath.  It doesn&#39;t have any other markings.  The 
side walls are squeezed in pretty tight (even for a clarinet mpc).  

I don&#39;t have a list of playing characterisitics for it as I haven&#39;t had 
a chance to try it out.  I&#39;ll post again later if I find time to give 
it a go.
