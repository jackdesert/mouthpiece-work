            <pre class='message__body'>I was having a hard time finding the correct 90 degree angle when 
placing the glass to the mpc for measurement. I also found there are 
many variations to an unchecked placement...
So now I clamp a long flat piece of round solid metal tubing accross 
the top of my granite block so that it hangs ove the left edge of my 
stone. I place the glass up flush against it and the mpc below and 
VIOLA! perfect 90 degrees. The tube olny takes up maybe 1" so I 
don&#39;t lose too much sanding space, but takes ALL the guess work out 
of it.

            <pre class='message__body'>My poor old grey matter is having a hard time visualizing &#39;flat....round&#39;
describing the same item.  Would you mind describing this again with a bit
more detail?  I don&#39;t have a glass gauge so that might help with the other
part but, just where does the mpc go?
Thanks
Ralph

            <pre class='message__body'>OK... so they say something like %15 comprehension from words... 
less when I am talking - SOOooooo I posted a pic out in the Guaging 
section for y&#39;all to see what I mean. Hope this makes it clear. I 
apologize for any brain strains...
This has made a world of difference in my measurements.

            <pre class='message__body'>Now I see!  Great pic.

Now think about drilling a hole for the rod into the side of your 
granite slab.  This would recover your top surface and not have any C-
clapm overhang.
