            <pre class='message__body'>Brian,

Being an engineer that understands what is going on when you deform 
metal, I would also say that getting a machine shop to decrease the 
diameter of your mouthpiece is the most likely option to wreck your 
mouthpiece. This is because there may be stress paths and residual 
stresses that you don&#39;t know about (from the process of making the 
mouthpiece in the forst place), and when you go squashing the shank 
down, you&#39;re risking one of those unseen stress paths and residual 
stresses becoming over stressed, and deforming (perhaps even 
cracking) in places that you don&#39;t want deformation, such as the 
table (if the shank end of the table pushes up, you may not get a 
proper seal between it and the reed, and it&#39;s likely to decrease your 
tip gap at the same time).

However, the main thing to keep in mind is that your precision made 
mouthpiece (or at least relatively precision made) isn&#39;t likely to be 
altered to any real degree of precision by some workshop - not even a 
good one. Asside from this, you&#39;ve spent money on the mouthpiece, so 
you want it to retain its value. If you go altering it like that, 
it&#39;s value will be likely to plummet, because it&#39;s then nowhere near 
being in original condition.

Aside from all of this, there is the physiological (actually, in this 
case, neurological) aspect of it. Having just changed mouthpieces 
myself, I&#39;m in a very good position to give you the benefit of my 
experience on this:

If you continually swap from one mouthpiece to another (particularly 
on the same instrument - not quite as relevant when comparing a 
soprano sax mouthpiece with a baritone mouthpiece, or even alto and 
tenor - but still relevant to a certain extent), you&#39;ll find that 
your embouchure won&#39;t be "just the right shape" for either of them. 
This is because your brain will (even if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s 
happening) start to adjust the neurons and neuron connections to get 
used to the new mouthpiece, and then it&#39;s making you use the wrong 
embouchure for the old mouthpiece when you swap back to that. I hope 
that you can see that swapping mouthpieces all the time will leave 
you in "no man&#39;s land" as far as your brain&#39;s adjusting your 
embouchure is concerned. And no matter how similar the two "perfect" 
embouchures are, there will be differences, and in fact, the more 
similar they are, the more troubles you&#39;ll have with the finer points 
of your embouchure.

Of course, I&#39;m coming from the perspective of a "tone perfectionist", 
where an ever so slightly imperfect tone is not good enough. Perhaps 
you&#39;re not quite so concerned about your tone as I am, but if you 
weren&#39;t concerned with your tone, you wouldn&#39;t be likely to be on 
this list trying to find out how you can use this other mouthpiece 
that will give you a certain tone you want...

Needless to say, my advice is to figure out which mouthpiece you like 
the tone of better, and stick to it, never to play the other one 
again. However, if you don&#39;t want to take that advice, I would get a 
machine shop to make up a sleeve to adapt the larger bore mouthpiece 
onto your neck. But be careful not to lose it up the bore of your 
mouthpiece.

Anyway, that&#39;s my 2 cents worth...

            <pre class='message__body'>Danny brings up a good tangent topic on using several mouthpieces.  

I use to stick with one, somewhat versatile, mouthpiece and I would try to
vary my embouchure and reed to play styles from classical to hard rock. 
But I now find that having several mouthpieces for all the styles allows me
to keep my embouchure more constant and I tire out less.  I still need to
pick the most appropriate one for the situation and use embouchure for
style changes.  If someone calls a sweet ballad, you dont say "excuse me
while I change my mouthpiece".  (Only the Strathon allows a quick baffle
change.)

Yes, it is great to really "know" a mouthpiece and sax by sticking with
one.  But if you are a doubler, you need to be able to adapt quickly to a
new instrument and mouthpiece size anyway.  Plus, it&#39;s a lot of fun!

Danny and Brian,
      I&#39;m also an engineer (mechanical) with some understanding of
metallurgy and fabrication methods, and I can assure you that a proper job
of swaging down the shank of a metal mouthpiece is highly unlikely to crack
the metal, as it as brass and quite ductile. If it&#39;s nickel-plated the
plating will probably crack and/or peel, however if silver- or gold-plated
the plating should remain intact.  From the small amount of deformation
we&#39;re talking about here, the residual stresses will be low and nothing to
worry about.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree, Keith.  The teacher who tells his high school jazz band lead
alto to use his Selmer C*, and a good player can do anything with just
that one mouthpiece, is misleading that young player.  The Selmer C* is
no more appropriate for jazz band or rock and roll than is a Dukoff for
sax quartet.

I find I need three setups... a classical for that kind of playing, a
middle of the road setup for 90% of my playing, and a full throttle
rock/R&B mouthpiece.  No big deal switching, it is no different than
switching from alto to tenor, or any other double.

No, you can&#39;t switch in the middle of a gig for one tune, or insert or
remove a baffle or spoiler... embouchure can take care of any minor
changes.  But you know going in generally what you need for a particular
gig.

            <pre class='message__body'>Here is a follow up to my suggested method:

The 5-Min stuff worked for me.  I would use whatever epoxy you have 
laying around.  But if you need to go buy something, JB Weld would be 
creamier and would set slower.  After is starts to set up (like 1-2 
hours?), you could wet your finger and smooth it out some more.  You 
may not have to sand it at all unless it is too tight.

            <pre class='message__body'>I can certainly see your point there about widely different styles, 
etc. Personally, I come from the standpoint that I play mostly west-
coast "cool" jazz, so the one mouthpiece will serve me very well. But 
occasionally I also play a bit of rock with a few friends. However, I 
tend to take the view that Stan Getz seemed to take: make the music 
fit the sound, but whatever you do, don&#39;t change your sound, because 
that&#39;s a big part of you. For instance, with my new mouthpiece, I 
have a very big, warm, fat (actually, more like obese) sound. It&#39;s 
perfect for the music I play mainly, but when I play rock, I don&#39;t 
change back to the metal mouthpiece - I just find a way to make my 
tone fit the situation so that I don&#39;t have to change my embouchure: 
*blow* through the horn instead of breathing through it! Doing that, 
I get more volume but it&#39;s still really fat and warm, and the guys 
that I play with love it - they think that the sound I&#39;m getting now 
is much better to play with than the sound I was getting with the 
metal mouthpiece.

Besides... You&#39;re not likely to "stand out from the croud" if you 
sound like they do. It&#39;s the ones that sound different to all of the 
preconceived ideas that a person&#39;s ears will pick up the most. That&#39;s 
why Stan Getz was called "The Sound"... Nobody else had the same 
tone, and he was noticed for it. If he hadn&#39;t had such a distinctive 
tone, he would have ended up like Zoot Sims: Yes, well respected, 
etc, but nowhere near the success story: In 1962 Getz went "top 40" 
with "Desafinado" and again in 1964 with "The Girl From Ipanema". Who 
else has stayed true to their ideals and done (in the "saxophone 
world") this without something special (be it tone, like Getz and 
Desmond, or total technical mastery, like Parker) that "stands out 
from the crowd"?

Certainly, I respect your desire for a different tone depending on 
what you&#39;re playing, but you do have to admit that it&#39;s less likely 
to make you stand out as something different if you end up sounding 
just like people expect you to for the type of music being played. 
You wouldn&#39;t expect a Getz-like tone to go down well with people that 
play rock, but it seems to work for me. And I don&#39;t have to 
compromise my tone to do it... Anyway, it&#39;s just food for thought.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dave,
Very good point. But do you really think it&#39;s wise to leave a 
precision made device in the hands of "just any old tradesman"??? 
They&#39;re likely to clamp it in all of the wrong places (etc, etc, etc) 
as far as a mouthpiece is concerned... You would be running a serious 
risk of ruining the facing of a perfectly good mouthpiece. Sure, you 
could (by chance or good management) get someone that will take the 
required amount of care, but they are usually not the normal fitter 
and turner that is commonly found. Personally, I still think that the 
best bet is to make up a spacer to go between the cork and the 
mouthpiece. If there isn&#39;t enough space to do this, the epoxy in the 
bore would be my second preference, because it&#39;s more reversable than 
permanently deforming the mouthpiece.

Another 2 cents worth.
:-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Dave,
If you go for quantity, then perhaps that&#39;s so.

However, there is also a qualitative aspect: Do you "win" if you have 
10,000 mouthpieces, none of which produce the sound that you want? Or 
do you "win" if you have 1 mouthpiece that produces the exact sound 
you want? After all, none of us would be on this list if we didn&#39;t 
want to get the exact sound that we want...

Yet more food for thought, me thinks...
:-)

But I do take your comment with the humour that I assume it was sent 
with.
:-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Paul,
Just for interest&#39;s sake, I&#39;ll refer you back to what I replied to 
Keith&#39;s post... Does a "Stan Getz" type of tone work in rock 
(the "Jazz-Samba" type of sound)?
No?
But it does for me! And it stands out from the crowd to have a big, 
fat, warm sound, instead of a more thin, raspy, brittle sound that 
seems to me to be the sound that most rock players go for.
Contrary to the "normal conventions"?
Yes.
Wrong tone for the job?
If you look at the majority you would think so, but if listened to 
with an open mind to the blending of the tones of the various 
instruments, it actually makes a refreshing change from the 
normal "status quo"... Something different. Originality. 
Uncompromising individuality. Isn&#39;t that basically what music is all 
about?

Yet more food for thought...
:-)
