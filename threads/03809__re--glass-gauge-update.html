            <pre class='message__body'>I wonder why white paint is used for the etching fill. I would have
been happy with black which I find contrasts well with the steel
feelers. Un-filled would allow a DIY choice. ?? Eddie

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Morgan glass gage that I do not use.  It has brown lines painted
on it, no etching.  I find the brown lines more difficult to use with Hard
Rubber mouthpieces. 

I&#39;m sure you could paint over the white lines or find a solvent that would
remove them.  I could ask for some without paint if you really want them.
