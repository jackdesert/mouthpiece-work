            <pre class='message__body'>The subject line just about says it all, I&#39;m used to a wide tip opening and long lay on Tenor and like the flexibility etc, just need something more suitable for playing indoors(Lol) with unamplified ensembles.  I bought the Link with this in mind, but had not considered at the time all the variables. I don&#39;t want louder, and don&#39;t want to play 1 1/2 reeds on this thing the way it is.  Any input will be appreciated.  Thanks, John

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,
I have found that the 8 tip opening on the Excel spreadsheet to be the 
best for me. The difference is adjusting the baffle to suit my needs. 
Long higher baffle for loud
modern sound and shorter rollover leading into a quicker drop off  for 
classic and not so loud.
cheers
Ross
