            <pre class='message__body'>I was wondering what effect flatter or rounder tip shape could
possibly have on the sound of a mpc. I would assume that the closer
you are to the actual tip shape of the given reed the better the seal
and therefore the better response... just curious if anyone has tested...

set on the brand of reed that you use, it is a good
idea to get close to that contour.

Good Luck,

            <pre class='message__body'>Patrick:  I found this in some letters from Santy Runyon, which later 
became his reed article on Sax On The Web:

 

"If the reed(when you press it down) covers the entire tip

rail, you will observe that the tome becomes more clear and more solid,

---even alittle darker.  in turning the mouthpiece around (looking at

the top of the Mpc, and pressing the eed down with the finger, you

should see a miniscule hair line oft the reed sticking out.  It also

tells you ifthe tip of the mouthpiece has ben shaped to fit the contour

of the reed properly.  However the tip of the reeds arenot all the same,

so it doesnt really matter if the reed is covering the entirtip rail."

            <pre class='message__body'>When you match the mouthpiece tip curve to the reed tip curve, it allows
you to get a different sound and response by using thin tip rails.  The
sound is a little edgy and more responsive.  This works well on traditional
lead alto mouthpieces like Meyers.  By thin I mean .018"-.020" thick as
opposed to .032".  The problem is, if you use another reed shape, you do
not get the full benefit of the thin rail.  It can even be worse.  So I
usually targer for .032" or so and may be a little thinner on some HR alto
and soprano pieces.

Yes, this is a fairly easy alternative.  You risk splitting a reed, 
but it is just a reed.
