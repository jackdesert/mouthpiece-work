became his reed article on Sax On The Web:

 

"If the reed(when you press it down) covers the entire tip

rail, you will observe that the tome becomes more clear and more solid,

---even alittle darker.  in turning the mouthpiece around (looking at

the top of the Mpc, and pressing the eed down with the finger, you

should see a miniscule hair line oft the reed sticking out.  It also

tells you ifthe tip of the mouthpiece has ben shaped to fit the contour

of the reed properly.  However the tip of the reeds arenot all the same,

so it doesnt really matter if the reed is covering the entirtip rail."

  When you match the mouthpiece tip curve to the reed tip curve, it allows
  you to get a different sound and response by using thin tip rails.  The
  sound is a little edgy and more responsive.  This works well on traditional
  lead alto mouthpieces like Meyers.  By thin I mean .018"-.020" thick as
  opposed to .032".  The problem is, if you use another reed shape, you do
  not get the full benefit of the thin rail.  It can even be worse.  So I
