            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys
 

 

 I just want to know how to tame that shrill sound on a mouthpiece? I have a stock mouthpiece here with a square chamber and the sound is too shrill for me. 
 

 

 Is it possible to soften it just like that of the otto link or meyer? 
 

 

 Anyone can help? I don't have an idea how to do it.
 

 

 Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the answer 

 

 But what I am referring to is during the refacing process..
 

 

 Is it possible to tame or soften the shrillness of the mouthpiece? If yes, how does one do it? File the baffle or make the tip rail thick perhaps?
 

 

 

 

 And by the way what part of the mouthpiece contributes to the shrillness of the tone? 
 

 

 Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks 

 

 But what I mean is during refacing process...What part of the mouthpiece that makes that sound shrill and piercing?
 

 

 Is there a way to soften that sound like that of otto or meyer? 
 

 Is it to file the baffle or make the tip rail thicker?

            <pre class='message__body'>Lowering the baffle near the tip rail has the most effect.

Lowering the baffle in general helps.  Curving the sidewalls and enlarging the throat also helps.  But this makes the chamber volume larger and can affect the intonation.

            <pre class='message__body'>Wow 

 

 Thanks for that
 

 

 At least now I know
 

 

 By the way, is the post on the files section about "File Baffle To Darken Tone" is the same with the softening/taming shrillness of sound? 
 

 

 

 Thanks
