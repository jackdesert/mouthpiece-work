            <pre class='message__body'>Runyon makes the current Brilhart Level-Air, which has been reported 
to be a Smoothbore on the outside and a Quantum on the inside.

Since they make use the same machines to make the metal and Delrin 
versions of the Quantums and Smoothbore/XL...do you think they would 
make me a Delrin Level-Air?

It&#39;s been a slow day at the office....

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve mused over similar ideas.  I have a tenor XL in my pile.  I was
thinking of making a Delrin Jaguar out of it.  But is could be bored out to
make a modern LA too.
