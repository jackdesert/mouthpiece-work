            <pre class='message__body'>I have found out the hard way, excavating a mouthpiece in an effort to make it sound bigger, be more "free blowing" etc is counterproductive.  
   
  Also, the more material that is removed, the farther the mouthpiece must be shoved onto the cork to tune AD0.  Then the mouthpiece is too short and plays sharp in the high notes.  Intonation goes whacky.

            <pre class='message__body'>Not only do I find enlarging the chamber counterproductive, I have filled in some of the chamber on Link Tonemasters, resulting in a more focused tone, better intonation, and improved response.  I have done this on quite a few Links, with good remarks from the customers.

Paul, you must admit there are some peashooter mouthpieces that sound 
shill and harsh that would benefit from some chamber work.
