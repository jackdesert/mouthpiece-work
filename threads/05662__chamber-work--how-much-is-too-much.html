            <pre class='message__body'>When it comes to removing material to enlarge a chamber there is a 
limit to the amount of material you can remove.  Some of us have 
learned the hard way and have been left hold a dead sounding 
mouthpiece. Are there measurements or rules for good judgement to know 
how far to excavate or when to stop?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have found out the hard way, excavating a mouthpiece in an effort to make it sound bigger, be more "free blowing" etc is counterproductive.  
   
  Also, the more material that is removed, the farther the mouthpiece must be shoved onto the cork to tune AD0.  Then the mouthpiece is too short and plays sharp in the high notes.  Intonation goes whacky.

            <pre class='message__body'>Not only do I find enlarging the chamber counterproductive, I have filled in some of the chamber on Link Tonemasters, resulting in a more focused tone, better intonation, and improved response.  I have done this on quite a few Links, with good remarks from the customers.

Comprendo, Keith and Paul, proceed to remove sparingly by slight 
degrees and play test between adjustments with attention to pitch and 
sound quality. 

Paul, you must admit there are some peashooter mouthpieces that sound 
shill and harsh that would benefit from some chamber work.

  Yes, I do.  And too small is as bad as too large.
