            <pre class='message__body'>Is anyone here familiar with this process? 2nd, would anyone be 
interested in doing a job on a piece for me on a Sumner 3*

drastically changing the length of the mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry, not me.  I have done this before.  Besides, the radius of the curve is too
great.  You just cannot rework it to a larger tip opening without also greatly increasing
the facing length.  It takes more silicon carbide paper than you want to pay me

my standard refacing fee.  You are better off buying another mouthpiece.  But the
tip opening can be opened in a more conventional manner, maybe.  If there is enought
material available on the mouthpiece.  Paul

            <pre class='message__body'>Mouthpieces can be closed or opened from the table, but this also changes the entire facing schedule.  
   
  If you torque the butt end of the table when making a table pass, the tip and facing schedule will open and grow longer.
   
  If you torque higher up towards the window when making a table pass, the tip and facing schedule will close become shorter.
   
  It is also important to note that the geometry of the mouthpiece will change with either of these techniques.  Typically a clarinet facing is set back into the body at around 4.5 degrees, but with many re-facings this can change to as much as 6.5 degrees.  Incidentally Zinner blanks come from the factory with a very set-back facing cut at about 6.5 degrees (not good in my opinion).  This makes one play at a more trumpet-like angle (horizontal).
   
  So when opening the facing by torquing the table at the butt, it is actually a good way to �correct� a facings slack geometry.

            <pre class='message__body'>I angle a table to open a tip on 1 out of 20 mouthpieces or so.  I usually
do not charge extra for it, but it is more work.  It helps to start with
fairly coarse emory paper.  I use 220 and vacuum it often.

The main reason I resort to angling the table is when I have a piece with
curved sidewalls that are scooped out very close to the window opening.  In
this case, significant tip cutting will cut into the curved sidewalls and
possibly open the window too wide for a standard reed width to cover it.

I sometimes angle the table to avoid reworking a tip rail and baffle a lot.
 But it is much easier to just rework the tip back to the orginal shape.  A
good refacer can come close enough that you can not tell the difference.
Usually some tip opening is needed to help better define the tip rail
shape, symmetry and thickness.  Shortening the length should not be a big
concern.  No one has every told me their mouthpiece sounds short.

It sould be noted that on sax mouthpieces, you need to cut a lot more off
the table to get a gain in tip opening.  You want to approximately pivot
the table about a point near where the facing begins to curve off the flat
table.  The distance from the start of the facing to the heel of the table
is typically about 2.5 times the facing length.  This means in order to
gain about .010" in tip opening, you need to cut the table until you take
about .025" off the heel.  A caliper reading across the piece can help
track your progress.  A lot of players want their vintage pieces opened
.030" or more.  This means cutting 1/16" to 3/32" off the heel.   Then you
need to trim the width of the table and blend in the sides of the
mouthpiece.  Often, the ligature will no longer fit well.
