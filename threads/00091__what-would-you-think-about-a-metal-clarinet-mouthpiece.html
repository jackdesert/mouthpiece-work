            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m going to start making clarinet mouthpieces this summer and am 
considering making a solid silver piece.  I think it will work just 
fine and I had Everett Matsons approval before he died.  Any input 
would be great. Phil Barone

            <pre class='message__body'>My humble opinion is that clarinet players are of the classical group, with a 
few exceptions, such as Dixie Land Jazz and Ethnic music. 

 I would compare them to violin players, which are also of the classical 
group, with the exception of the Ethnic players and Country fiddle players.

The fiddle players stepped out of tradition enough, to even accept electronic 
fiddles!  Although I do not think that the classical violin players, would 
even buy a metal bridge (even if it was solid silver).

Would classical clarinet players accept a metal mouthpiece?  What if it was 
solid silver?  Once the movement to break tradition got momentum, you 
certainly would be in a position to become the ICON of a new wave.  It is a 
gamble, but you would kick yourself, if you do not follow through with your 
inspiration.

Leave out the "spoilers" in the first batch.  You can always come out with 
the "MEGA Barone MAGNUM"!!!!!

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve heard its been done in metal. Dont know about silver. I&#39;m sure there
are a few people out there willing to try/buy it.

If you really want to know, try posting the question where the clarinet
players hang out at Sneezy.com and alt.music.clarinet.

            <pre class='message__body'>What is the Market in clarinet mouthpieces?  What do clarinet players want 
and what are they willing to pay?

Out of curiosity I checked a list of 177 CLARINET mouthpieces that were in 
the "completed auction" category on e-Bay.  As I thought, that they would be 
selling pretty cheap, most of them did averaged only a $20~ price!!  So I 
thought that clarinet pieces are not given the attention and value of 
Saxophone pieces.

HOW EVER, There are fickle clarinet players too, because I found 20 pieces, 
with an average price of $198.58.

There  is; a $250, $330, $380, $710 and a $711 mouthpiece, in this list!
BTW there are some made of Crystal (glass).

            <pre class='message__body'>I think it has been done, but perhaps not in a high quality way.

I would ask the clarinet players at Sneezy.comm and 
alt.music.clarinet.
