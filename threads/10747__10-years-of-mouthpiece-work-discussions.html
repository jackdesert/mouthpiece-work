This is a fantastic group, - very, very useful for us who live far from the civilized saxophone world. I had not been refacing mouthpieces without this group.
Many thanks from one of only two refacers in Norway!

            <pre class='message__body'>Congratulations from the second refacer in Norway as well!! This is an
absolutely outstanding group, and as with Egil I would never been able to do
refacing  without this group and all the generous members. As far as I know
Egil and I are the first refacers in Norway ever thanks to this group!!

 Congratulations Keith on starting this wonderful site ten years ago.
    After a lifetime of amateur playing was nearing an end, I found 
 this site opened up a whole new hobby and showed me how to re-lay 
 mouthpieces properly, after my early attempts, using an smooth door 
 step as the abrasive 53 years ago.  ha ha
                                  Am I the only refacer in Scotland ? 
  Greetings to you all and thanks for sharing your knowledge.  Eddie.
