            <pre class='message__body'>This is very difficult to do.  This is done by removing material from 
the table of the mouthpiece at an angle, removing more at the butt end.  
It is difficult to do this without making the table convex.  Also, 
unless you want a longer facing, you have to remove enough material so 
that is shortens the facing, then blend the side rails back to the 
table, and arrive back at the same facing length.

 

The problem is, by the time you do all this, you are back to about the 
same tip opening as you were before.

 

If you will draw this out on paper, and play with a ruler and pencil a 
little, you will see what I mean.

Hi:

thanks for the reply.  I have been trying to figure a
better way to do it, and so far have not had any luck.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is relatively difficult to do.  If you do it right, you typically need
to take 2.5 X the material off the butt as compared to the tip.  So if you
want to open the tip .010", you need to take .025" off the butt AND not
make the table convex AND nail the pivot point at the facing length.  With
mistakes you end up taking more off or end up cutting the tip anyway.

The method does leave the tip relationships the same, but I find it not too
difficult to reshape them back close to where they were.  Who says they
were so great to begin with?  The butt cut also makes your ligature
loose... sometimes a lot.

Still, I use it on some pieces, like vintage Links.  Mostly if the tip and
side rail material is too thin to open them up much.

The target is the facing length.  But you need to make the facing a little
shorter as you do it so you have something to work with for the final facing.
