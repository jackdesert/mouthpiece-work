I have a white Delrin Quantum (just bought used) that has a horribly
uneven facing (about 5 mm uneven in length) that is too short anyways,
so I&#39;m going to make a project of it. Love the sound but it&#39;s too much
work to play presently. Haven&#39;t done a bari piece before. Couple of
questions for those that may have experience with these.

It tends to squeak in the upper register a lot...the tip is very
indefinite, so I am tempted to relieve the baffle a little right
behind the tip before I reface. Does this change the sound of these
much? Is the material there thick enough...I measure ~3 mm where I
want to &#39;scoop&#39;. 

In the absence of other input, I will just copy the facing from my
Lamberson 7SB...plays spectacularly...any better suggestions before I
start?

I&#39;m planning to smooth the bullet transition and the &#39;wall&#39; at the
bottom of the window...any reason not to?

thanx, jeff

Go for it.  Make a flat or shallow lake that looks like you made a 
thumbprint.  I done several bari and tenor Quantums and they are all 
better in my opinion with the roll-over baffle relieved like this.  
JVW did my 1st one like this before I was into this work.  I used it 
as one of my study pieces.

That should be fine.  A radial facing that is 52 long should be good 
too.  You might want to start by flattening the table by taking more 
material off the side that has the longest facing length measurement.  
This is often an easy way to fix an uneven facing.

I do a little of this too.  I also thinned the rails but needed to 
taper them so I could still stick a Spoiler in, though I rarely play 
with one.

Good luck.

            <pre class='message__body'>Jeff:  First work the table down a little to shorten
the facing a bit, then reface.  Make the facing length
24 mm ("48" on the Babbitt gauges).  Yes, you can file
behind the tip a bit.

            <pre class='message__body'>My experience has been that cutting just behind the tip rail tends to make a mpc more forgiving in terms of squeaking, but it does take a bit of the edge off--for better or for worse. Before you do that why not get the facing even and see what happens. Uneven rails are, of course, a notorious cause of squeaking and chirping.
