This is one of the happiest announcements I&#39;ve EVER had the pleasure to
make: 
 
 ALL OF PAUL COATS INTERNET ARTICLES ON SAXOPHONES WILL BE MOVING TO
SAXGOURMET.COM AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AT OUR SITE EXCLUSIVELY!!
 
As many of you know, Paul has been a long time associate of mine and has
been instrumental in helping me develop many of the products sold by our
company. He&#39;s ALWAYS been the very first one to try our new designs, and his
advice and wise counsel have been invaluable to us. Paul has also served as
the arranger for my saxophone quartet, and has long been in charge of facing
and regulating my personal mouthpieces. More importantly than any of the
business considerations, Paul is the chairman of my "posse", and his
friendship (and the friendship of his entire family) is something that
Sharon and I treasure beyond words.
 
We will be moving the articles immediately to our site, where a special
section will be specifically devoted to Paul&#39;s scholarship and research. We
got over 5 million visits to saxgourmet.com last year, and we are most
anxious to share Paul&#39;s expertise with our many friends worldwide. Again,
Paul&#39;s writings will be EXCLUSIVE to our site, and will be available NOWHERE
else. A list of his articles appears at the end of this message.
 
I will tease you by letting you know that we expect a couple of other WORLD
CLASS saxophone authors to join us at saxgourmet.com in the very near
future, and will announce those arrangements when the ink is dry.
 
Paul&#39;s Articles which will soon be on our site include:

"The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
