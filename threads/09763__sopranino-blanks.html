I realize this is a long shot, but I&#39;m curious if anyone here knows of a domestic source for inexpensive sopranino saxophone mouthpiece blanks in plastic or hard rubber.  Web searches for even cheap stock mouthpieces bring up nothing, which is a bit surprising considering how many people are now importing sopraninos.  Are the Asian manufacturers not offering loose mouthpieces like they are for soprano?

Thanks!

Matthew Hanson

            <pre class='message__body'>They don&#39;t sell nino mouthpieces individually....all of the cheap Nino that I have seen use the same mouthpiece, and that factory has a minimum order of 50.....we sell individual nino mouthpieces at www.nationofmusic.com

Steve,

Thanks for replying so quickly.  I figured they must not be offering sopranino pieces in low quantities.  I appreciate you confirming that.  If you ever decide to order the 50 to stock hard rubber sopranino blanks even temporarily, please keep me in mind.  I know you like to offer things nobody else sells and I realize the market isn&#39;t huge for such an item, but if absolutely nobody else in the USA is offering them, then all sales go to the one who is.  If you have to order 50, I can use 4 right now.  Those metal nino blanks you had a while back seemed to have actually sold very quickly as well.  Just a thought.

I&#39;m currently needing hard rubber for Ab sopranino clarinet mouthpiece fabrication on a metal instrument where the mouthpiece actually slides over the body sax style.  It is easier and much cheaper for me to alter the internal dimensions on HR sopranino sax pieces than ream a back bore and refinish the outside of the tenon on a new $280 modern Ab clarinet piece which doesn&#39;t really suit this horn very well anyhow.  Besides, I could always use some spare sopranino blanks to use for saxes as well.

Happy New Year to all!

Matthew Hanson

            <pre class='message__body'>I can&#39;t think of any reason I would order any mouthpieces like that. Everything we sell is our own design.
