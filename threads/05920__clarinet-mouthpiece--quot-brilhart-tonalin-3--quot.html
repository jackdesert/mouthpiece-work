            <pre class='message__body'>Hello listers and mouthpieces workers

I&#39;m a subscriber of this for several months now, and just spent this
time reading all the very instructive posts of this list. 

I just quickly present myself before going on with my question. I&#39;m an
amateur clarinetist (about 30 years of clar behind me), amateur metal
clarinet addict (I overhauled a couple of instruments) , and amateur
instrument builder (I build bamboo saxophones, designing my own
mouthpieces, crafted in bamboo and wood).

My question is : I have an old Brilhart Tonalin 3* clarinet mouthpiece
which is almost unplayable. There is no apparent dammage on the
mouthpiece, so I suspect that it has been very badly refaced.

Does somebody have measurements of the facing of these mouthpieces, so I
can compare to the actual facing and eventually take appropriate
refacing decisions for it ?

Thank you in advance

Eric

I would recommend you take measurements off a good playing clarinet
mouthpiece you have and try an make the Brilhart close to those targets.

Hello Eric,  It may be of only academic interest to know the Brilhart
3* was .045" tip and .594" length (15mm) All the * numbers were of
this length, given that the tips went from 39 to 58. Very short by
comparison with other makes. The plain numbered (I.E. no * ) &#39;pieces
had the same tip openings, but were all .687" in length.    Eddie

Thank you Edward. 

This is more than academically interresting ! At least it confirms me
that the mouthpiece have been (very badly) refaced.
