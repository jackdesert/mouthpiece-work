            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t normally try to hawk my wares on these sites, unless 
specifically asked, but we have two exceptionally fine SML alto&#39;s for 
sale.  These are New Old Stock from a store whose owner had passed 
away, and the family had placed everything in storage for years.

Both altos are "Revision D" types, c.1952 or thereabouts, serial 
numbers in the 9500 range.

Lacquer is about 95%+ ORIGINAL lacquer, engraving is beautiful and 
sharp.  There are, naturally, some spots here and there as you would 
expect from 56 year old saxes, but overall, very nice.

These SML&#39;s have been repadded by Ed of Whispering Winds using 
MusicMedic.com Roo pads, with Pisoni metal dome resonators, 
MusicMedic clear shellac (not hot glue), all new corks, felts, 
bumpers. 

These saxes were new, never sold.

These are as close to new as you will ever find.  They are new!
