            <pre class='message__body'>Have you ever tried to find information on mouthpiece making or 
refacing?  Until now you&#39;ve been pretty much on your own.  It is such 
a niche field that very little has been written down to help you get 
started or to help refine your skills.  Pros working in the field are 
usually too busy working on pieces or they regard their methods as 
trade secrets.   I think there is plenty of work to go around and we 
need to communicate to elevate the art and science of mouthpiece work.

It is my hope that we will accumulate files and photos pertaining to 
mouthpiece work.  I look forward to an active forum where we can 
share our ideas and experiences.   

I have decided to start the group as open to the public and 
unmoderated.   I belong to some good groups set up this way.  If we 
have problems in the future, I&#39;ll consider changing it.

Welcome.  Start by posting your level of activity and interest.

            <pre class='message__body'>Very cool idea Mojo,

I have thought about tinkering a bit, but haven&#39;t the time to chase 
down the needed info. if I can find it all in one place it will ease 
that trouble, then it will be finding the time ;-) (4 kids etc etc 
doesn&#39;t leave much huh?)

I have a Jumbo Java T45, that I would like to just clean up a bit, a 
few nicks on the inside of the side rails, and I&#39;ve thought about 
experimenting with making it a Deep V . maybe open the tip a bit as 
well...

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

Thanks Keith for setting up this group!

I&#39;m mainly a tenor player, and for the last 3 years have played on 
pieces either customized by myself or Jon Van Wie, whom I highly 
recommend by the way.  I play both rollover-baffle pieces and 
straight - angled ledge baffle pieces (like Dukoff), and find places 
for both in my playing.  My mouthpiece experience includes some
refacing, tip curve shaping, experimenting with baffle shapes, some 
chamber stuff, some inner side wall stuff.  I&#39;ve tried the "bullet-
chamber" shape and like the loudness, but can&#39;t get the vibrato and 
tone I like yet. I was inspired to start working on my own 
mouthpieces after experimenting with an unsatisfactory piece that 
had "mini-tracks" built into the baffle.  Many thanks to JVW for
his help with understanding the role of various mouthpiece parameters.

Over and out,
Ken Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks, Keith! This is one area that I&#39;m really anxious to learn more about. I&#39;ve gotten hands on instruction from Santy Runyon, Paul Coats, and Ron Cohelo, and have corresponded at length with Jon Van Wie (who does all of my personal mouthpieces) and Bob Ackerman. I&#39;ve got all of the tools, but never seemed to be able to develop the "chops" necessary to do great refacing. I really appreciate the opportunity to learn from others.

            <pre class='message__body'>Certainly right on the mark, Phil!  That is why I suggested we do as is
suggested by John Winslow, and use some student model pieces,

I turned a lot of good mouthpieces into junk before I started to get

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, the chamber---they come in small, medium and large.  Some are round and 
some are square and some are even elliptical ("Guardala Fat Boy Model").  
There are also a Double chamber and a Deep V chamber ("Rovner").  Also I 
heard a theory, that a fluted surface (running the long way, in the chamber) 
enhanced tone.  I can&#39;t remember the name of the mpc. with the flutes.  I do 
know that there was a M.C. Gregory with a center rail.

I know that large chambers are for a more vintage sound and small chambers 
are for modern EDGE sound.  I think that I will play it safe and concentrate 
on the medium chamber size.

I heard that the reason for square chambers is to make manufacturing easier, 
I don&#39;t Know if this is true.

I am intrigued with the idea of the elliptical chamber.  I might take a cheap 
plastic mouthpiece and place it in boiling water (with a fitted wooden dowel 
inserted in the neck bore).  When the plastic becomes soft, I will try to 
press it elliptical shaped, between two flat wood jaw caps in my precision 
tool makers vise.  I know that I will be in for some major mouthpiece table, 
rail and facing reconstruction, but it would be worth the practice! 

BTW, there is a molding rubber ("Facsimile") that is used in machine shops, 
for making an impression of chamber shapes.  After it has set, one can remove 
it by pull-stretching it out of its chamber.  The neat thing, is that this 
material is so elastic, that it is guarantied to have a memory for its 
original molded shape.  The male impression is then measured with a "Optical 
Measuring Projector."  One could also take soft caliper measurements.
