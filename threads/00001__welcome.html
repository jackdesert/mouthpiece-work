I have decided to start the group as open to the public and 
unmoderated.   I belong to some good groups set up this way.  If we 
have problems in the future, I&#39;ll consider changing it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Very cool idea Mojo,

I have thought about tinkering a bit, but haven&#39;t the time to chase 
down the needed info. if I can find it all in one place it will ease 
that trouble, then it will be finding the time ;-) (4 kids etc etc 
doesn&#39;t leave much huh?)

I have a Jumbo Java T45, that I would like to just clean up a bit, a 
few nicks on the inside of the side rails, and I&#39;ve thought about 
experimenting with making it a Deep V . maybe open the tip a bit as 
well...

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

Thanks Keith for setting up this group!

I&#39;m mainly a tenor player, and for the last 3 years have played on 
pieces either customized by myself or Jon Van Wie, whom I highly 
recommend by the way.  I play both rollover-baffle pieces and 
straight - angled ledge baffle pieces (like Dukoff), and find places 
for both in my playing.  My mouthpiece experience includes some
refacing, tip curve shaping, experimenting with baffle shapes, some 
chamber stuff, some inner side wall stuff.  I&#39;ve tried the "bullet-
chamber" shape and like the loudness, but can&#39;t get the vibrato and 
tone I like yet. I was inspired to start working on my own 
mouthpieces after experimenting with an unsatisfactory piece that 
had "mini-tracks" built into the baffle.  Many thanks to JVW for
his help with understanding the role of various mouthpiece parameters.

Over and out,
Ken Barry

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks, Keith! This is one area that I&#39;m really anxious to learn more about. I&#39;ve gotten hands on instruction from Santy Runyon, Paul Coats, and Ron Cohelo, and have corresponded at length with Jon Van Wie (who does all of my personal mouthpieces) and Bob Ackerman. I&#39;ve got all of the tools, but never seemed to be able to develop the "chops" necessary to do great refacing. I really appreciate the opportunity to learn from others.
