            <pre class='message__body'>Are any members of this distinguished list attending the NAPBIRT conference
in San Antonio in a few weeks? I&#39;ll be exhibiting all of our saxophone
models, our new line of flutes (these will impress you!), my new mouthpieces
and cases, and some other surprises (once again, the ink isn&#39;t quite dry on
the deals.....)
 
I&#39;ll most likely come over a day or two before the show and will be there
for the entire event.
 
I&#39;m not a NAPBIRT member, so I won&#39;t be attending the clinics. My activity
will be confined to the trade show area.
