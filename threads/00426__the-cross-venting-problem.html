            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Steve. This is a great topic for an acoustics discussion. My
first thought on the matter is that this sounds like a solution looking
for a problem to me.  [:)]

The notes that are "under-vented" due to the cross fingering effects of
a spring closed tonehole after the primary venting tonehole are A (G#),
E (Eb), and D (low C#).

All of these notes have a tone that is full and that consistent in
quality and timbre with the surrounding notes on a well made saxophone
such as a professional Selmer, Yamaha, Yanagisawa, Keilwerth,
Cannonball, etc.  The exception of course is the marked difference in
timbre between the open C# and the 4th line D which is a different
phenomenon as the sax goes from its first to its second harmonic series.
There are even performance techniques and fingerings to get around this
issue in slow lyrical passages.

Another important issue has to do with the intonation of those above
mentioned notes which are called "under vented" by Curt Alterac in his
"Balanced Venting" article.  That is that each of those notes has a
tendency toward sharpness in the second register due in part to the
compromise position of the octave vents.  Somehow adding another opening
would only exacerbate the inherent intonation issue on these notes while
making only a very insignificant difference in the timbre and voicing of
the note.

The true test of any innovation or so called improvement to the
saxophone is whether that innovation is copied and adopted by the major
manufacturers of the instrument and becomes a part of the "standard
design" moving forward.  The records office is littered with scores of
what were "great ideas" at the time that were never adopted or accepted.
It is this test of time that separates the true innovations from the
impractical gimmicks that are often times passed off as innovations in
order to sell instruments.

I also think you underestimate the impact of inertia in instrument design.  A lot of the things in a saxophone are "good enough" solutions (like the cross venting). Could you make a horn with no cross venting but keep the fingering the same?

In any case, fixing the cross venting issues of the Boehm system

The left hand C and the right hand F# are both "cross fingered" notes having and open-closed-open tone hole sequence.  In my experience neither of these has had a serious issue with tone quality or intonation.  Both of course have the alternate chromatic fingering.

I learned from Gary Scavone&#39;s thesis that the neck octave key is ideally set for the note B which is the center note of the 5 notes using that octave vent with 2 notes a half step apart above and below.

The body octave vent is set for the note F which is the center of 7 notes using that vent, with 3 notes a half step apart above and below.
According to Scavone, the farther away the note is from this "ideal" note the sharper it becomes.  Hence high A and high C# tend to be sharp, as does 4th line D and high G#.  

Individual makes may vary a bit, but this is the octave venting compromise theory that I have read about.

            <pre class='message__body'>It does, however, make a difference; the question is one of what one is willing to accept. Flute players are taught never to finger F# with RH2, but to use RH3, even though this is much more awkward generally, since the slight dulling of the F# is deemed unacceptable in the flute world. Sax
 players seem less picky. As to the D: simply open the C# key and you will find a noticeable brightening of an otherwise somewhat dull note. It would certainly be possible--if a way were found to keep the C# key open--to slightly reduce the diameter of, or reposition, the D tonehole. I am
 skeptical, however, that the cost of the extra keywork would be worth the benefit of slightly improved timbre.

In terms of the octave pip: I know that Steve is not a true believer, and I respect his experience, but Benade did report significant improvement in terms of intonation using a smaller and shorter pip, and gives the formula for determining the dimensions. This is, IMO, a no-brainer if it does
 improve intonation and response (as Benade claims) without a single extra mechanism. If you read Benade&#39;s discourse about reactive/resistive pips in FMA, though, it is clear that this has to be gotten right for the best compromise for response between loud and soft playing.

In regard to the "stuffy D" phenomenon, it has been pointed out that opening the palm D improves the quality of this note tremendously. The reason given (that I read) was that this hole is in the exact correct position to act as a register hole for the D. Of course since the hole is so large, it
 detunes the note considerably.

It would be interesting to see if making this hole much smaller (by temporarily covering it with something relatively rigid and making a small pip-sized hole in that cover) actually would benefit the timbre of the D2. If this is the case, it should be relatively easy to design a third register
 hole for the sax (such as the oboe has) to benefit that note. Ideally this would be controlled by the octave key, but it could also be tremendously simplified by connecting it via the LH3 touch, in a way that the mechanism would be accessed by lifting the LH1 finger (like on the flute).

 I have some ideas for the mechanism, but it would be silly to expend more energy on this without first testing to see whether a second, lower register key for the D actually improves the note (which anyway is generally not bad on sop and alto).

You have made some interesting observations.  My experience has been that anything that significantly alters the traditional fingerings of the instrument will not be accepted by the saxophone community and therefore not commercially practical to produce.

A perfect example is the amazing chromatic keyed saxophone invented by Jim Schmidt. He has solved just about every timbre and intonation problem but he is the only one who can play it.

Most woodwinds have a characteristic tone color on certain individual notes that are a part of the "charm" and identity of the instrument.  In fact I can hear an alto saxophone and tell which note is being played by the color of the tone on most notes.  I certainly don&#39;t have perfect pitch.  It is this pallet of tonal colors that gives each woodwind its personality throughout its range.  If the timbre of every note on an oboe could somehow be perfectly matched, it would sound more like a synthesizer than an oboe.

The bottom line in investigating this issue is the tempo and duration of the notes.  In a faster musical passage, the timbre (and even the intonation) of the individual notes is not an issue.  It is only in slow passages and where notes that are sustained that the "color" of the tone is of musical importance.  In these cases there are a myriad of alternate fingerings that can be used to put individual notes into the "tonal context" of the phrase.  A common example is the use of the "long C#" fingering for 3rd space C# to better match the "dark" sound of an adjacent D or E.

In response to your comment that sax players are "less picky" and use RH2 rather than RH3 to play F#, let me remind you that this fingering actually sounds fine on the saxophone because the toneholes are larger and not the same size as on the flute.  Furthermore, I challenge you to a duel trilling from E to F# at twenty paces for your insulting remark.  So there.  :)

            <pre class='message__body'>Or, could it be we just unraveled every last mystery is all.......lol.  I&#39;m building prototypes of a couple of new neck designs.  

The first features a precisely positioned and silver soldered, precious metal divining rod, with which the sensitive musician can locate subterranean water or mineral deposits.  Acoustic coupling of the air column with ultra LF integral Earth vibrations can greatly influence tone and response.  

The second incorporates adjustable precious metal pyramid structures which can be positioned over the nodes of the neck, at varying heights and angles.  Ultra HF integral cosmic vibrations, focused at node locations can dramatically reduce acoustical energy loss to &lt; 98%.
