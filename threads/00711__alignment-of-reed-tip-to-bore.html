Hard to believe this would matter.  But the data says it does (a little).

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

I wonder what sort of controls he used. Knowing how significant bore dimensions are I think it would be hard to reproduce them exactly with two different table angles. One would have to test a whole slew of mpcs and do some statistical analysis in that case. 

I read that when the air column does a big curve like in the bow it changes the speed of the waves in the torus--reelatively slows them down I think I remember (the math is horrendous). To compensate the diameter needs to be contracted slighty. It would be interesting to know how the air column vibrations propagate at the tip--as we are going from a flat plane to a cylinder as the pulsations develop across the baffle and into the chamber.Perhaps there is something in there that is significant vis-a-vis having the "flat plane" of the tip in line with the cylinder of the throat. Still my guess is that whatever effect is observed would have more to do with volume than geometry. Gasses don&#39;t know anything about angles, they just fill whatever volume is availabe with an even distribution of molecules. But I don&#39;t really know enough about fluid dynamics...

            <pre class='message__body'>           In my opinion the major effect will come from the change in playing angle. The playing angle for sure has a effect
          on sound. This geometry will suit me perfectly as I like to play with the sax ahead of me close to the centre of
           my body. On regular mouthpieces it darkens the sound giving a heavy tone, as one cant get under the reed enough
           to form the perfect embrouchure.   
            
           The opposite geometry works well on straight soprano . (tip far away from centre of bore)
 
            Much of the sound difference might thus be attributed to how COMFORTABLE the angle is.

I clipped the following from the description of the Hite 129 baritone 
sax mouthpiece, out on the J&D Hite website 
( http://www.jdhite.com/mouthpieces/saxmpc.htm):

"...The table is angled in such a way that the tip of the reed is 
centered on the bore of the mouthpiece. This improved design gives 
the bari a rich lean sound rather than the old style spread, heavy 
tone. Both high and low registers are enhanced, and tonal flexibility

Does the alignment of the reed tip in relationship to the bore really

Dr. Laurence Wyman 
Sax Prof and refacer based in Fredonia, NY. Order his Alto MP Paper 
at http://www.umi.com #7224955. 
http://www.fredonia.edu/som/wyman/Page2.htm
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Wyman studied 12 mouthpieces emperically averaging the results from 
several players.  He recorded subjective comments of the players and 
also frequency spectrums.  He consulted with S. Rascher for 
suggestions on the scope of the study.  The paper (thesis) is almost 
200 pages.

He also explored several "one variable" tests by taking a single 
mouthpiece and modifying it.  He did this to study the bore-to-table 
angle.  Larger angles bring the tip closer to the bore centerline.  
He took a single mouthpiece and parted it at the shank so it could be 
tilted at two different angles.  He sealed the joint with silicone 
rubber.  "The increase of the angle made the tone quality more 
uniform in spectrum shape throughout the range and generally made for 
more richness of the tone by decreasing the energy of partials 2 and 
4 and increasing the energy of partial 3".  Earlier in the papre he 
explains more what he considerers desireable in a sound and how it 
relates to the frequency spectrums.  He further confirms his results 
by sorting his 12 test mouthpieces from smallest to largest bore-to-
table angle.  The small ones had a "certain degree of stuffiness 
experianced by the performer".  The largest one (A Brilhart Level 
Air) had an "extremely even tone quality".

That&#39;s very interesting. As a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic I can&#39;t help but think however that twelve mpcs is not a very large sample. I also imagine that changing the angle of the split mpc couldn&#39;t help but change the chamber dimensions. Still, who am I to question a 200 page thesis of a Professor Emeritus of Saxophone? These things must have been brought up in his peer review.

I&#39;m going to have a look at my mpc collection tomorrow and do my own little test....

  you have more money sunk into some mouthpieces you are not using.  Sell one

playing alto, soprano, and bari saxes, and least comfortable on tenor.
I noticed that these MP angles were always more "clarinet-like" than
my tenor, which gives me no end of trouble with respect to articulation.

I have experimented with the angle of the tenor MP in my mouth and
found tht the more "clarinet-like" the angle the easier to get the low
notes to speak, and the more clarinet like the tone (dark and ringing
as opposed to richer and somewhat diffuse). But physically It&#39;s very
uncomfortable to play like that (high angle) for long.

Can anyone provide a few pointers on which mouthpieces currently
available provide a high table-to-bore angle, making this easier?

            <pre class='message__body'>It sounds like you are more concerned with the angle of the mouthpiece to
your embouchure.  There used to be a tenor sax mouthpiece made that had a
angled shank bore attached the mouthpiece body.  It looked like a kink from
the side.  The ads ran in Sax Journal a lot.
