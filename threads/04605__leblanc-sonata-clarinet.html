            <pre class='message__body'>I am a newer member to the group and I would like to say I really enjoy 
all the information that is shared here thank you all....I am currently 
student teaching at Parkway high school in Bossier City Louisiana, and 
the director here is buying 4-Leblanc sonata clarinets and my question 
is what would be some good classical/ band ensemble clarinet mouthpiece 
for the students to consider buying, the school has recieved a fleet of 
David Hite Premier clarinet mouthpieces on the recommendations of 
myself and some local pro/band director clarinet players I am a 
saxophone player who doubles on clarinet and I use a portnoy BP02 
etc...The director is looking for a big very dark Chicago Symphony type 
of sound for his top ensemble thanks in advance for any help that will 
come sincerely Jason Morris....

            <pre class='message__body'>Look at the Roger Garrett DL model mouthpiece for clarinet.  They are  
hand-faced and not that expensive.  WWBW has them for under $50.00.
