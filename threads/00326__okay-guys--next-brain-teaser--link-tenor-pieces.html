Brian,
      Pour yourself an epoxy baffle --- details upon request --- if done
right can be removed later with little or no damage to the interior of the
mouthpiece. Or, get it refaced, probably with a longer facing with a
sharper transition from the flat portion (table) to the curved rails,
without changing the interior.

But try some shapes with temporary putty to see if it does the trick.

I just recently acquired some epoxy with brass powder in it that I 
want to try out on a beat up modern Link I have.  It looks like Theo 
uses something like this in his customized Links.  Looks nice, if 
nothing else.

            <pre class='message__body'>Brian,
If you want to experiment, putting electrical insulation tape in here 
and there to decrease the chamber and/or increase the baffle (or to 
change its profile) is a good way to see what you like and don&#39;t like.

I did it with my metal Wolfe Tayne 8* - increased the baffle to get a 
little bit more brightness (I had to go for brightness as a poor 
substitute for fatness, due to the embouchure I was using to stop the 
harsh nature of the tone I would have got out of it by playing 
it "properly")...

It&#39;s worth a try, and it&#39;s *completely* reversible! If you don&#39;t like 
it, take the tape back out, and rub the sticky stuff off with some 
rubbing alcohol.

Of course, you have to remember to *build* up the testing baffle 
using a heap of tape under your top layer, otherwise it&#39;s likely to 
flap around in the breeze.
;-)
