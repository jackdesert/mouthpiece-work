I have a very nice early babbit Link tenor 7* metal piece  but as 
with most Links there is just no cajones to it, plain vanilla dead 
sound with no highs.. so what to do without totally ruining the 
piece.. any suggestions short of Theo or Jon VW.?

Brian,
      Pour yourself an epoxy baffle --- details upon request --- if done
right can be removed later with little or no damage to the interior of the
mouthpiece. Or, get it refaced, probably with a longer facing with a
sharper transition from the flat portion (table) to the curved rails,
without changing the interior.

            <pre class='message__body'>See my Baffle Post from 6/26/02.  Last paragraph has what I do now.  
But try some shapes with temporary putty to see if it does the trick.

I just recently acquired some epoxy with brass powder in it that I 
want to try out on a beat up modern Link I have.  It looks like Theo 
uses something like this in his customized Links.  Looks nice, if 
nothing else.

            <pre class='message__body'>Brian,
If you want to experiment, putting electrical insulation tape in here 
and there to decrease the chamber and/or increase the baffle (or to 
change its profile) is a good way to see what you like and don&#39;t like.

I did it with my metal Wolfe Tayne 8* - increased the baffle to get a 
little bit more brightness (I had to go for brightness as a poor 
substitute for fatness, due to the embouchure I was using to stop the 
harsh nature of the tone I would have got out of it by playing 
it "properly")...

It&#39;s worth a try, and it&#39;s *completely* reversible! If you don&#39;t like 
it, take the tape back out, and rub the sticky stuff off with some 
rubbing alcohol.

Of course, you have to remember to *build* up the testing baffle 
using a heap of tape under your top layer, otherwise it&#39;s likely to 
flap around in the breeze.
;-)
