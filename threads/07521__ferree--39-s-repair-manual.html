            <pre class='message__body'>The Ferree&#39;s Repair Manual is available as a new, edited reprint Part number REP for $30. Has anyone used a new or old version of this book? I want to know if there is a chapter on mouthpiece facing and and can you comment on the quality of the writing and information in the rest of the book. 
Thank you for the book review.

The section on refacing in the Eric Brand book is good....I checked my old
Ferree&#39;s repair manual and it doesn&#39;t have anything about mouthpieces

The Ferree&#39;s Repair Manual is available as a new, edited reprint Part number
REP for $30. Has anyone used a new or old version of this book? I want to
know if there is a chapter on mouthpiece facing and and can you comment on
the quality of the writing and information in the rest of the book.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, thanks for looking. I gave up on finding my Erick Brand book and another is on the way.

I do not have a new repair tool idea, but I do have a sax idea. How about an altissimo register key? I&#39;ve wondered if sax&#39;s need a half hole like the bass clarinets. A reliable way to hit another octave would make even the high F# and G sax&#39;s obsolete. 

If you figure it out, I&#39;d love to try it one!

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve built one of those. The altissimo key we use on the Category Five horns
works MUCH better..see www.nationofmusic.com for details
