The Ferree&#39;s Repair Manual is available as a new, edited reprint Part number
REP for $30. Has anyone used a new or old version of this book? I want to
know if there is a chapter on mouthpiece facing and and can you comment on
the quality of the writing and information in the rest of the book. 
Thank you for the book review.

I do not have a new repair tool idea, but I do have a sax idea. How about an altissimo register key? I&#39;ve wondered if sax&#39;s need a half hole like the bass clarinets. A reliable way to hit another octave would make even the high F# and G sax&#39;s obsolete. 

If you figure it out, I&#39;d love to try it one!

Steve, thanks for looking. I gave up on finding my Erick Brand book and
another is on the way.

I do not have a new repair tool idea, but I do have a sax idea. How about an
altissimo register key? I&#39;ve wondered if sax&#39;s need a half hole like the
bass clarinets. A reliable way to hit another octave would make even the
high F# and G sax&#39;s obsolete. 

If you figure it out, I&#39;d love to try it one!
