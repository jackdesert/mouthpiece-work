Based on the Vandoren 5RV for Eb Clarinet and the Pyne S series

I have my C Clarinet now and it came with an Amati 6 mouthpiece.  I&#39;m going to keep my mouthpiece but I put my Pyne S series mouthpiece on it because I can get more of a true clarinet tone on the C Clarinet with this.  

Based on the Vandoren 5RV for Eb Clarinet and the Pyne S series mouthpiece for Bb clarinet, how does the Amati 6 mouthpiece measure up?

I&#39;m using the Vandoren V12 and the Vandoren LaRue 56 reeds.
