            <pre class='message__body'>I have my C Clarinet now and it came with an Amati 6 mouthpiece.  I&#39;m 
going to keep my mouthpiece but I put my Pyne S series mouthpiece on it 
because I can get more of a true clarinet tone on the C Clarinet with 
this. 

Based on the Vandoren 5RV for Eb Clarinet and the Pyne S series 
mouthpiece for Bb clarinet, how does the Amati 6 mouthpiece measure up?

I&#39;m using the Vandoren V12 and the Vandoren LaRue 56 reeds.

            <pre class='message__body'>FWIW, none of the Amati mouhtpieces I&#39;ve tried were good (for soprano and bass clarinets, alto and tenor sax). I&#39;d even say they were pretty awful!
