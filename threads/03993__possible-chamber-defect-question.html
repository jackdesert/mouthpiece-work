            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I recently purchased a brand new hard rubber soprano mpc made by a
"very respected veteren mpc maker" (don&#39;t want to name names).  I
really like the way it plays & there seems to be no problem for me
there, however....

When looking down the inside, from the shank, on most soprano mpcs, we
see a circle or inner "ring" where the inside of the shank meets
ceiling & sidewalls of the chamber.  (I&#39;m bad with terms, but I think
you guys know what I mean)

On this mpc, the top right of the "ring" is gouged out, making a very
lop-sided circle, like the maker was working on the chamber & slipped
and gouged out one side or, in a way almost looks melted.  (but probl.
not)

So, the big question is...should I send this back, and what actually does
this (or could) effect?  

(Bear in mind, I am happy with the way it plays,
possibly because Im using it on a Serie III, and have to push the mpc
almost all the way down on the neck--like most mpcs on these Selmers &
Im also a very experienced, advanced player & feel that I am able to
notice a lot of subtle differences in mpcs & reeds--which, Im not sure
is a good thing, sometimes:)

Anyway....any opinions out there?

Here is one opinion for what it&#39;s worth:  If it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t
fix it.  If the piece plays in tune, and responds the way you want
it to, and works with lots of different reeds, has the right sound,
etc.....why mess with it?

I agree. Chambers can be very uneven without that having a deleterious 
effect on the sound--unless things are very bad it is more the volume of the 
mpc at any certain point and how that changes over distance than the shape 
that makes the sound. Playability is more affected by a flat table and 
especially evenness of the height of the rails (and of course the curve of 
the lay). If you like the way it plays don&#39;t worry about it.
