            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, guys.  This is my first post here after quite some lurking.  I&#39;ve
got a question about a clarinet mouthpiece I&#39;m having problems with.

What happens is the lower on the horn I get the harder it is to get
the note to speak, it wants to play one of the higher overtones
instead.  What error in a mouthpiece design will cause this to happen,
and how can it be fixed?

            <pre class='message__body'>I would suspect a pad leak.  Have you tried other mouthpieces on your
clarinet or your mouthpiece on someone elses clarinet?

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah, a leak would be the first thing to look at, but it&#39;s only this
mouthpiece.  I tried a dozen or so different ones on it yesterday, and
it&#39;s just the one that has a problem.  It&#39;s an O&#39;brien 5+, fwiw, looks
like it says Denman on the top.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sounds like a very open faced mouthpiece. Denman probably refers to John
Denman.

Such an open mpc like this might do better with a softer reed.

            <pre class='message__body'>From the 1950 Eric Brand Refacing pamphlet, the O&#39;Brien 3 clarinet measures
34 24 14 8 with a 118 tip. Facings 1 and 2 are progressively closer, so a 5*
must be very open.

 

From my dim past, I recall that O&#39;Brien used an off-center bore.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes I&#39;ve measured it, it&#39;s 1.41 and 37 on the glass guage.  One rail
is a little higher than the other most of the way.  I don&#39;t know if
this is the original facing, but the baffle has clearly been worked on.  

Anyway, the pop test sorted it out, though.  It&#39;s not great, but not
terrible for a clarinet (about 1 sec).  But then I tried the pop test
again with the barrel on.  Leaks like a sieve.   Your were right to
begin with, there was as leak.  It&#39;s at the tenon cork.  Fixed that,
and now it plays.

            <pre class='message__body'>Congrats.  I had not thought of testing the seal with the barrel.  These
are things that come to you when the pieces are in your hands.

            <pre class='message__body'>I was going to mention the pop test and that was a great idea to do it with and with out the barrel.  I&#39;ll remember that for the sax, to do it with and with out the neck.
