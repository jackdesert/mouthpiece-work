            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,
 
I was asked to improve this Runyon mouthpiece (pictures attached).  The story goes something like this... "all I know it was on my stand and someone came up to me and said my sax was bumped...."  The owner said the mp had a burr on it so he took a rasp and filed the burr away.  then went on to say it never played the same (oh really?).  By looking at the picturesyou can see where  the tip was destroyed.  If I want to add material then reshape the tip what techniques (and materials) would work best?  I am considering silver solder or spot plating.

Bill, you can&#39;t attach files to most yahoo group posts.  You would have to put photos in a file in the file section.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lately, it seemd like Yahoo Group is sending all attachments through.  Maybe it may depend on your Email provider.  The attachments are automatically saved on the Yahoo MouthpieceWork group site in an Attachements folder.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hal>You may not need to add material to the mouthpiece. I have never had 
good luck with that. It is usually possible to move the window and 
create a new tip in the process.
