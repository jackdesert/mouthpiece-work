I was asked to improve this Runyon mouthpiece (pictures attached).  The story goes something like this... "all I know it was on my stand and someone came up to me and said my sax was bumped...."  The owner said the mp had a burr on it so he took a rasp and filed the burr away.  then went on to say it never played the same (oh really?).  By looking at the picturesyou can see where  the tip was destroyed.  If I want to add material then reshape the tip what techniques (and materials) would work best?  I am considering silver solder or spot plating.
