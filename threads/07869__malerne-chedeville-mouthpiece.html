            <pre class='message__body'>Hi there,
I just bought a Malerne Tenor mouthpiece from eBay, It looks brand new and not use at all.
Are these mouthpiece made to this day or is it a new old stock item?
It has R M (i think) in gold letters on the top and has the letters M C
on the side.
It has the 3 round lines at the top also a round roman like pattern on the top but near the end.
Is there any connection between Malerne and Chedeville?
Is this a vintage mouthpice?
Is it an expensive mouthpiece (how much)?
Is it,,,,,

best regards,
Joe
