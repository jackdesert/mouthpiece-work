Hi Ken

I know from you website that you don&#39;t believe the material of the mpc has a
significant impact on the sound, so I am interested to know why you plan on
making metal ones.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Rohan,

Good catch -- that&#39;s true, I don&#39;t believe material affects the 
sound. However, a lot of people just like metal for its density, 
heaviness, and looks. It also makes a difference to the player, with 
the vibrations being conducted through the top teeth.  It&#39;s just 
another option I want to make available to become a full range 
mouthpiece maker.  I should include this in the faq on my page now.  
Thanks for making that observation.

Best regards,
Ken

I think it has been mentioned before that, even if you could compare a metal
and HR mouthpiece with identical facings and interior dimensions, it is
conceivable that the change in mouth position could change the sound more than
any difference in material. Also (as I think Keith meant), it certainly
changes the feel in the mouth - many players are only comfortable with one or
the other. No doubt they could get used to the other material and exterior
shape, but that intial weird feel of a different profile mouthpiece is often a
deal- killer for them.
