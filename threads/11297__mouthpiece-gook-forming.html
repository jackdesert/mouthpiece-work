I took m dremel to a ponzol M2 Plus to lower the baffle, and make it somewhat more like a Guardala MB2 or MB1 (inspired by mojo bari&#39;s videos! thanks)  I &#39;m starting to get the color and flexibility I want out of it, while retaining the brightness and maybe even more volume.

Sounds like your Dremel cutting/grinding tool had been previously used on normal steel or iron.  The roughened stainless surface has now been contaminated with steel/iron dust, which has begun to rust.  Phosphoric acid (Home Depot) is commonly used to clean rust contamination stains from stainless steel.

Dang, Bill! You&#39;re old enough to work on mouthpieces and you STILL leave your reed on your mouthpiece?  Do you know what that does to your reed?  Do you know what grows inside the mouthpiece if it doesn&#39;t dry out good?  And you put that mouthpiece back in your mouth?  Do you kiss your wife with that mouth?

(Paul leave teacher mode)

Sorry, I just had to say something.  Hahahahaha....

The dremel and bits were brand new out of the package, so I&#39;m not sure it could have been contaminated.  I did notice that when I was working on it that it became too hot too handle at one point, and I had to put it down.  Also, some of this brown stuff started forming overnight before I actually used it on a gig, and the reed was off overnight.

I&#39;ll try home depot next.  Maybe there&#39;s an aisle for "screwed up baffle work"!

Thanks for the suggestions. Pepsi didn&#39;t work, and silver polish and tarnish
remover also didn&#39;t work.

The dremel and bits were brand new out of the package, so I&#39;m not sure it
could have been contaminated. I did notice that when I was working on it
that it became too hot too handle at one point, and I had to put it down.
Also, some of this brown stuff started forming overnight before I actually
used it on a gig, and the reed was off overnight.

I&#39;ll try home depot next. Maybe there&#39;s an aisle for "screwed up baffle

Thanks for the suggestions. Pepsi didn&#39;t work, and silver polish and tarnish remover also didn&#39;t work.

The dremel and bits were brand new out of the package, so I&#39;m not sure it could have been contaminated. I did notice that when I was working on it that it became too hot too handle at one point, and I had to put it down. Also, some of this brown stuff started forming overnight before I actually used it on a gig, and the reed was off overnight.

I&#39;ll try home depot next. Maybe there&#39;s an aisle for "screwed up baffle work"!

  It would be safer to start with a softer abrasive like regular 0000 steel wool, perhaps soaked in  various solvents to see what might take it off , and then work up in hardness from there until you  find a way to remove the gunk. Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>I can&#39;t imagine that BL casts stainless steel. Surely they work from solid rod/hex/bar stock.  Rough machining/grinding will leave the surface pitted.  The specks are just pits that weren&#39;t polished out.

SS wool won&#39;t clean contaminants  stuck in there.  You&#39;ll just have to polish the surface smooth, and polishing will alter the internal dimensions, to the depth of the pits.  One must take that into account from the start :-)   I use fine lapidary grit for polishing out file/machining marks.  A strip of thick leather glued to an old HF file makes a nice polishing tool.

I can&#39;t imagine that BL casts stainless steel. Surely they work from solid rod/hex/bar stock.  Rough machining/grinding will leave the surface pitted.  The specks are just pits that weren&#39;t polished out.

SS wool won&#39;t clean contaminants  stuck in there.  You&#39;ll just have to polish the surface smooth, and polishing will alter the internal dimensions, to the depth of the pits.  One must take that into account from the start :-)   I use fine lapidary grit for polishing out file/machining marks.  A strip of thick leather glued to an old HF file makes a nice polishing tool.

I have seen some stainless steel castings contaminated with iron specks.  Mostly Bergs.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Lori.  Yes, that is what I mean.  I just put a Larsen piece of mine into
a CLR equivalent for 15 minutes to test.  There was no evident change to
the stainless.  A good soap and water wash should be enough afterwards, but
if you want to stop the acid action, rinse the piece and then put it into a
solution of Sodium Bicarbonate when you&#39;re done.

Cheers,
Geoff.
