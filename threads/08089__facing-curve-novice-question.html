            <pre class='message__body'>Hey guys,

Well, I&#39;ve read a bunch so far and downloaded/read through a bunch of the items in the "files" section, but I have a pretty big misunderstanding of something that&#39;s probably pretty basic. I couldn&#39;t find the answer right away using the search function here though, so figured I&#39;d ask. 
I have read so far that the radial curve is best for saxophone. I also understand the basics behind picking a facing length that&#39;s right for you. I would probably gravitate more towards Keith&#39;s approach - I like the idea of medium-long to long facing curves for low note response. I am also mainly interested in the classic designs for alto and tenor - the Meyer and Link. Those are the two pieces I want to concentrate on the most for the alto and tenor, as well as the rubber Link for soprano. 
The big thing that I don&#39;t understand is: For a given tip opening and a given facing length on a saxophone mouthpiece, how do you determine the radial facing curve for your refacing job? 
To clarify, say you have "X" tenor saxophone mouthpiece, and say you know that you want "X" tip opening and you want the facing length to be "X" long, how do you determine all the numbers for your radial curve so you can plot them out for your feeler gauges? 
I see that there are alto-Meyer and tenor-Link spread sheets in the files section, and I have also downloaded the "Facing Curve.xls" spread sheet file. However, the thing I don&#39;t understand about the "Facing Curve.xls" file is that it has a facing length variable but no tip opening variable like the "Tenor Link" spreadsheet does. I understand the "Tenor Link" spreadsheet, but not the "Facing Curve.xls" spreadsheet because it doesn&#39;t have the same kind of variable inputs that the "Tenor Link" spreadsheet does. 
Is there some important/vital piece of information, or some kind of spreadsheet that I&#39;m missing that is needed to get started? Like, for instance, if I had a Vandoren V16 rubber alto mouthpiece, how would I go about calculating a radial curve for it? 
Thanks.

Matt

            <pre class='message__body'>I have said that a well-implemented radial curve is tough to beat on sax.  But I think the slightly elliptical curves are a tad better unless the tip is real open.  If you are doing classical sax mouthpieces with closed tips, more elliptical curves are better for the resistance they give when using longer facing lengths.

For a given tip opening and radial facing curve length, there is only one radius that will work mathematically.  This assumes the radius is perpendicular to the table at the facing curve tangent point to table, and the radius sweeps through the facing length (at the .0015" feeler) and the tip opening point.  Make a sketch to set up the math.  Or, you can look at the clinic Powerpoint file on my site for some helpful slide illustrations. 

I think some of the spreadsheets are set up so you  need to manually guess at the radius and facing length to get different curves.  You can use the Excel built-in "Solver" function to automate the process, but this takes some proficiency with Excel and curve fitting.  Teaching Excel skills is beyond the scope of this forum.  But we may be willing to offer some tips.

I have not looked at the spreadsheets we have in the files section recently.  If you continue to have questions on them I will take a look.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Keith,

Thanks very much for taking the time to help me out with this. OK, that makes sense to me. I guess the problem lies in the fact that, as a complete beginner to this, after setting up a drawing/sketch of the numbers, I (sadly) don&#39;t know how to set up the math. I really really want to learn this art form, and this is the main thing that I don&#39;t understand at this point - how to plot the facing curves once you know the tip opening and the facing length. 
I think that after I know this, it will be a lot easier to get started. I think I understand a lot so far about things like how facing length affects playability, baffle height affects sound, and how chamber volume affects the airflow, but I just can&#39;t seem to find an easy way to understand how to plot points on a facing curve. Like even without the spreadsheet.
Mfry on SOTW gave me a formula for a radial curve, but it was extremely complicated to someone like me whose professional studies don&#39;t normally call for mathematical or engineering-type thinking.
I just wanted to find out if there is some sort of simple formula where you take a tip opening like .105", a facing length like 46.5, and then calculate where on the glass gauge that the .010" feeler gauge or the .063" feeler gauge should go, etc. 
Sorry, I certainly don&#39;t mean to be a bother and I know you guys are very busy, but I&#39;d be really grateful if someone could explain this part of the process to me because I really do have a strong desire to learn this art form and I&#39;ve got the time and resources during the next year and a half or so to learn about it. I&#39;m really only wanting to learn about it for the joy and love of it to be able to make pieces play better for my own use, I&#39;m not looking to start a business or anything! Maybe years from now I could do work for other others, but that&#39;s really not why I&#39;m getting into this. I just want to learn it for fun. Thanks.

Between this info you guys have kindly shared and some email correspondence I&#39;ve had today with some other refacers, it looks like all the resources needed to get going are right here on this site and right at home with some mouthpieces that I own and like. I&#39;ve ordered the feeler and glass gauge set from Mojo and will look forward to getting started with some measuring pretty soon! Actually, I believe that I have access to a bunch of free plastic student model mouthpieces, so hopefully I&#39;ll have a bunch of blanks to practice putting facings on. I really am only interested in Link and Meyer type pieces anyway, and it looks like there are a bunch of facing charts for those on this site, so I&#39;ll probably just use those and see how they do. 
I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a long and interesting road of learning. Thanks for the help with getting started guys.

Dear Mr. Mojo,
Why is helping figure out how to use this worksheet beyond the scope of the forum? I know you are the boss of the forum and what you say goes. That said, it seems to me the spreadsheets are a GREAT tool for mouthpiece work. A tutorial on how the sheets are set up and where to put what measurement in would be QUITE useful. It would be much more relevant to the new mouthpiece facers than where the neck nodes are and if Ferron is right about saxophone acoustics. Sure, we can copy good designs, but what about when there is no good alto or bass clarinet mouthpiece available (is one even made??:-)) to copy or we want to change a design it a little?

I am a long time user of Excel, Lotus 123, MS Works and Open Office. But I use spreadsheets differently and did not design this worksheet. (Financial, inventory and database like functions don&#39;t need these kind of equations.)  Reverse engineering it blindly is difficult!. How about a step by step instruction sheet of where to put in your tip opening, the facing length and where to find and exactly what to do with the solver to make something that will work?

I&#39;m not asking for your exact trade secret formulas, and even if I did figure them out, your work will still be better than any newcomers.

Who else would like to get a good direction sheet posted?

            <pre class='message__body'>Just in case anyone&#39;s interested, I found something very useful last night when studying the Excel sheets. I do plan to do lots of measuring of real mouthpieces to begin the learning process pretty soon, but the spreadsheet idea seemed so helpful and well-thought-out that I also want to learn to use them a bit too - Found a bit of useful information that I thought would be worth sharing. 
For some reason, when downloading a bunch of the files here to look at, I originally skipped over the one called "facing schedules". Then I downloaded it last night and it has a nice instruction sheet included. That spreadsheet looks to me like a very good tool for generating a curve, and it comes with an instruction sheet to tell you how to use it. 
When you download the "facing schedules" file, it will put a folder on your desktop with two items - the Excel spreadsheet and a .txt file or something similar which is an instruction sheet for how to use the spreadhseet. 
It&#39;s actually pretty simple once you get the hang of it. 
The funny thing about it is that when I plugged in a bunch of numbers to the AD spread sheet and the "Facing Schedule" spread sheet, it seems like the "radial arc" numbers on the "AD" spreadsheet are slightly different than the "circular arc" numbers that come up on the "facing schedules" spreadsheet. As a novice, I don&#39;t know exactly what the difference is, I mean they&#39;re pretty close in some spots and in other spots it looks to me like they&#39;re almost an entire number different... Also the numbers seem different from what&#39;s included on the tenor Link spreadsheet file even when you plug similar numbers into it, unless of course I&#39;m doing it wrong which is also highly probable... 
However, the spreadsheets are really useful looking tools and I really like being able to see how the curves match up with each other as you change the numbers around. 
For the most part, I&#39;m going to try and measure each piece I can find, especially ones that play well, and then try and learn from that. Also, when I get ready to actually start trying the refacing process on some cheap blanks, I may try applying facings from other mpc measurements *and* also try applying facing curves that are determined by some of these computerized spreadsheets to see how they play when the facings have been applied to the mouthpieces. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be interesting. 
The AD&#39;s spreadsheet and the "facing schedule" spreadsheets are some of the most useful looking ones, and then of course there are the Meyer and Link tenor/alto spreadsheets but those look like they&#39;re just numbers that have been determined already for those mouthpieces - I am assuming those are standard numbers that Keith or someone else has found on Meyers and Links while studying them, or maybe they&#39;re curves that Keith or someone else has found that work well on those mouthpieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just checked these two spreadsheets.  I get exactly the same radial curve in each.  You need to be careful to duplicate the inputs exactly in both.  The feeler sets are different in spots.  Also the tip opening input is metric in the AD sheet.  The biggest difference is in how Facing Length is handled.  In the facing Schedule sheet, you plug in the facing length you want at the .0015" feeler.  In the AD sheet, you plug in the tangent point where the facing curve meets the flat table.  So you need to guess at a few longer values to get the facing length you want at the .0015" feeler.  

So to get the AD sheet to match the Facing Schedule sheet, put in 2.438 mm as the tip opening and 27.34 mm as the facing length (at the non-existent zero feeler).  Change the feelers to match and the numbers should be the same.

...The funny thing about it is that when I plugged in a bunch of numbers to the AD spread sheet and the "Facing Schedule" spread sheet, it seems like the "radial arc" numbers on the "AD" spreadsheet are slightly different than the "circular arc" numbers that come up on the "facing schedules" spreadsheet. As a novice, I don&#39;t know exactly what the difference is, I mean they&#39;re pretty close in some spots and in other spots it looks to me like they&#39;re almost an entire number different...

Today&#39;s Question -. This question may be more about measuring than just the worksheet. On AD&#39;s Elliptical spreadsheet, cells D8-F8 are marked for user input of "Feeler (inch/1000)" for 0.0000.  That one is so thin I can not see it and keep loosing it in my toolbox. (AKA - it does not exist. :-)) If facing length is measured with the 0.0015 gauge, how do determine the input length for those cells at 0.000?


Matt, I&#39;ll look for that .txt file again to see if it helps.

Everett - In regards to your question about the .0000 box on the AD Elliptical spreadsheet, you are right, there is no feeler gauge for that box. However, the facing length is still measured from the .0015 feeler gauge - you just toy with the yellow box at the .0000 feeler gauge mark with a few numbers until your .0015 feeler gauge mark on the spreadsheet reads how you want it to. To clarify - let&#39;s say you want to have your facing length be 49 (mm*2). When you open up the spreadsheet, the tip opening is set at .111" (or 2.82mm). For that tip opening we&#39;ll set the facing length to 49 just for kicks. So, go up to the radial arc yellow box where the facing length is entered at the .0000 feeler mark and enter the number 27.65 and press enter. Then, the number directly under that at the .0015 feeler mark will change to 24.5. 24.5mm*2 is a facing length of 49 on your gauge. 
If you change the tip opening, though, that number will change and then you can set the facing length again to whatever you want it to be. You just have to play around with the number at the .0000 feeler mark a little bit, trying a couple of different numbers, until you get what you want in the .0015 feeler mark box. Hope that makes sense and that it&#39;s correct (if I&#39;m wrong someone please feel free to shed some light on that...)

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, that is correct.  In my version of the spreadsheet (AD Elliptical) you have to determine the absolute facing length (feeler gauge of 0) by trial and error.  Yes, my facing lengths are in mm not 1/2mm.  Probably easy to modify for those who want to use the 1/2mm scale.

Since my glass gauge consists of a piece of glass with a small steel ruler taped to the back, I&#39;ve always used mm to measure length.

That&#39;s what you do when you live in the backwoods : )

Andrew

I&#39;m trying to convert it to the 1/2mm gauge scale and to use inches rather than mm for the tip opening and tip rail measurements.  The formulas are a little over my head to make any kind of logical changes to them.  Can anyone shed some light on that?  Thanks

Yes, that is correct.  In my version of the spreadsheet (AD Elliptical) you have to determine the absolute facing length (feeler gauge of 0) by trial and error.  Yes, my facing lengths are in mm not 1/2mm.  Probably easy to modify for those who want to use the 1/2mm scale.

Since my glass gauge consists of a piece of glass with a small steel ruler taped to the back, I&#39;ve always used mm to measure length.

That&#39;s what you do when you live in the backwoods : )

Andrew

It doesn&#39;t. If you look at Benade&#39;s formula it says: 

Fn = c/4L* sqrt((2n-1)^ 2+(8/pi^2) *(L/x0)), where Fn is the frequency of the mode n, c = speed of sound, L = length and x0 =length of end truncation, not length of &#39;correct end substitution&#39;.

When the cone is complete, x0 = 0, which cancels out the last two terms, and the formula then becomes simply  Fn = c/4L * sqrt((2n-1)^ 2).

As our saxophone truncation length (regardless of whether you adhere to the Dr J. Wolf, x0=mouthpiece = ca. 8%, or the Benade x0=mouthpiece + neck view = ca.22% (Nederveen)) never gets close to 1/3rd the length of the complete cone, this is irrelevant.

However that doesn&#39;t change the fact that we are talking about a truncated cone and not a complete cone. There is no "correct substitution" term included. This formula does not describe what happens when a mouthpiece of the correct volume acts as the
 missing cone tip, and this is exactly what Wolfe describes in the FAQ.Within certain limits set by the fact that air has mass and the walls are not lossless, a complete cone always plays harmonic overtones and a cone of a given length plays a frequency depending on that length.

And don&#39;t forget that the effective truncation changes with every fingering. In the palm keys, the truncation length exceeds 1:3 and approaches (or possibly meets) 1:2.

 Fn = c/4L* sqrt((2n-1)^ 2+(8/pi^2) *(L/x0)), where Fn is the frequency of the mode n, c = speed of sound, L = length and x0 = length of end truncation, not length of &#39;correct end substitution&#39;.
 
 When the cone is complete, x0 = 0, which cancels out the last two terms, and the formula then becomes simply  Fn = c/4L * sqrt((2n-1)^ 2).
 
 Benade&#39;s formula therefore is the way to find the frequency of an incomplete cone, and only applies until the truncation length is ~1/3 the length of the complete cone, after which some different things happen to determine Fn.

There is no "correct substitution" term included. This formula does not describe what happens when a mouthpiece of the correct volume
 acts as the missing cone tip, and this is exactly what Wolfe describes in the FAQ.Within certain limits set by the fact that air has mass and the walls are not lossless, a complete cone always plays harmonic overtones and a cone of a given length plays a frequency depending on that length.

And don&#39;t forget that the effective truncation changes with every fingering. In the palm keys, the truncation length exceeds 1:3 and approaches (or possibly meets) 1:2.

      It doesn&#39;t. If you look at Benade&#39;s formula it says: 

Fn = c/4L* sqrt((2n-1)^ 2+(8/pi^2) *(L/x0)), where Fn is the frequency of the mode n, c = speed of sound, L = length and x0 = length of end truncation, not length of &#39;correct end substitution&#39;.

When the cone is complete, x0 = 0, which cancels out the last two terms, and the formula then becomes simply  Fn = c/4L * sqrt((2n-1)^ 2).

Benade&#39;s formula therefore is the way to find the frequency of an incomplete cone, and only applies until the truncation length is ~1/3 the length of the complete cone, after which some different things happen to determine Fn.

In a complete cone, the theoretical frequency determination is very simple.
   
  From CCRMA:
   
  Pressure distributions along a pipe of length  L  are dependent on the boundary conditions at each end. A complete  cone has discrete standing wave frequencies given by  Fn = nc/2L for n 0 1,2,3...where c is the speed of wave propagation in air. 
   
  Note that there are no terms for cone angle, only  for cone length.

       It doesn&#39;t. If you look at Benade&#39;s formula it says: 
 
 Fn = c/4L* sqrt((2n-1)^ 2+(8/pi^2) *(L/x0)), where Fn is the frequency of the mode n, c = speed of sound, L = length and x0 = length of end truncation, not length of &#39;correct end substitution&#39;.
 
 When the cone is complete, x0 = 0, which cancels out the last two terms, and the formula then becomes simply  Fn = c/4L * sqrt((2n-1)^ 2).
 
 Benade&#39;s formula therefore is the way to find the frequency of an incomplete cone, and only applies until the truncation length is ~1/3 the length of the complete cone, after which some different things happen to determine Fn.

Complete Cones:  I see that the worldwide acoustical discussion is limited, exclusively, to musically applicable shapes - shapes that do have usable integral harmonic resonance characteristics, and, as you say, no reference is made to taper at all.  I would like to see some scientific proof, as I find it difficult to believe that a complete cone, 1m long, with a slant angle (side to base) of, 89.99 deg., and a opening of .2mm, would have identical resonance characteristics, compared to a complete cone, 1m long, with a slant angle of, 1 deg., and an opening of 57m.

So you agree that for a complete cone, angle doesn&#39;t influence pitch or mode relationships? This is not what Ferron is saying, as far as I can tell.

            <pre class='message__body'>Indeed not. As I say, there are complexities that limit the theoretical in the real world, such as the fact that air has mass and that wall losses are very high. And beyond that, there are a huge number of variables which do not scale linearly, so that there is certainly a limited range of cone
 angles which are musically usable.

But we know for a fact that semi-angles between 0.4 and 3.0 degrees are completely OK for woodwinds, since we have working instruments with angles in that range. This is a relatively wide range, over which octaves remain true and pitch remains the same, scaled solely by length.

In a complete cone, the theoretical frequency determination is very simple.
   
  From CCRMA:
   
  Pressure distributions along a pipe  of length  L  are dependent on the boundary conditions at each end. A complete  cone has discrete standing wave frequencies given by  Fn = nc/2L for n 0 1,2,3...where c is the speed of wave propagation in air. 
   
  Note that there are no terms for  cone angle, only  for cone length.

  Since when can we divide by 0?  Your x0 = 0 renders the formula invalid so the terms do not cancel.  What it says is that the frequency of the the truncated cone, for any fn, is a factor of the tube&#39;s taper.  Plug it into excel.  It does exactly what Ferron describes.

        It doesn&#39;t. If you look at Benade&#39;s formula it says: 
  
  Fn = c/4L* sqrt((2n-1)^ 2+(8/pi^2) *(L/x0)), where Fn is the frequency of the mode n, c = speed of sound, L = length and x0 = length of end truncation, not length of &#39;correct end substitution&#39;.
  
  When the cone is complete, x0 = 0, which cancels out the last two terms, and the formula then becomes simply  Fn = c/4L * sqrt((2n-1)^ 2).
  
  Benade&#39;s formula therefore is the way to find the frequency of an incomplete cone, and only applies until the truncation length is ~1/3 the length of the complete cone, after which some different things happen to determine Fn.

Ferron says: "Regardless of the instrument, a bore whose cone is too wide, is flat in the upper register."

You should know that this kind of narrowing of the modes is characteristic of a substitution whose volume is too large. This is indeed what happens when you use the same mpc on an wider cone with the same diameter at the truncation, since the volume of the missing tip is less than for narrower
 cone. But this is not what Ferron is saying. He qualifies everything on pg 14 with the statement: "Practically speaking, the cone is always cutaway, and the interior volume of the mouthpiece must correspond exactly to the missing part of the cone."

Also, moving just a bit deeper, his explanation of how changing cone angle adds a linear increase in Hz to the modes is not at all accurate, not even for a truncated cone with no substitution. The increase is neither linear for the modes, nor is it constant, depending as it does upon truncation
 ratio as well as mode and frequency.

            <pre class='message__body'>To bring the discussion back to a practical level, it seems to me that
the most important information to be derived from all of this is what
are the predicted effects of using a neck with a narrower or wider cone
on a saxophone.  The tenon end would, of course, be a fixed diameter,
but the taper to the tip could be enlarged or narrowed with the use of
dent balls or draw plates.  It is this type data that I am most
interested in that can possibly be used to improve the intonation and
harmonicity of  existing instruments.

Another thought I have been mulling over is to explore the effects of
widening and narrowing the bore at locations of pressure and velocity
anti nodes in the saxophone, not by moving the wall of the tube, but by
changing the volume of the closed toneholes in the vicinity.  This could
be done by stacking resonators to protrude more into the opening or
conversely making pads with a concave surface to enlarge the area.  Of
course adding to and taking away from the tonehole chimney is another
option, but it more difficult and would create problems on the stack
keys that are interrelated.

".....widening and narrowing the bore at locations of pressure and velocity

changing the volume of the closed toneholes in the vicinity.  This
could be done by stacking resonators to protrude more into the opening
or conversely making pads with a concave surface to enlarge the area."

Making changes in the closed tone hole chimney volume in this manner, also affects the open-hole venting, the cut-off frequency, and possibly the efficiency of the mechanism, if compensations are made.  I think, as per Ferron, this type of adjustment should be reserved for the final, very fine tweak adjustments, for artists with exceptional instruments.

To bring the discussion back to apractical level, it seems to me that the most important information to be derived from all of this is what are the predicted effects of using a neck with a narrower or wider cone on a saxophone.

            <pre class='message__body'>I was thinking more in terms of starting to experiment with the palm
keys and side keys where these factors would not be as critical.  This
is part of my motivation to find a practical method to find the
approximate location of the pressure antinodes.

I have been working with Benade&#39;s other formulas for finding n frequency
relationships in a changing cone and I think that I have discovered an
important principle.  Using his mathematics the frequency ratios remain
intact as whole number multiples.  What does change however is the pitch
of the fundamental.  This leads me to think that the out of tune
harmonics are not directly the result of the cone being the wrong taper,
but the result of the player putting the mouthpiece much farther on or
off to bring the instrument back to an AD0 tuning.   A taper too
narrow would be just fine if the tonehole locations were correct and the
saxophone played at AE0  A taper too wide would be ok if the
mouthpiece could be set to play at AC0.

What do you think?  I may be using the wrong formula or interpreting the
results the wrong way,  but so far this has been my conclusion.

the most important information to be derived from all of this is what
are the predicted effects of using a neck with a narrower or wider cone
on a saxophone.  The tenon end would, of course, be a fixed diameter,
but the taper to the tip could be enlarged or narrowed with the use of
dent balls or draw plates.  It is this type data that I am most
interested in that can possibly be used to improve the intonation and
harmonicity of  existing instruments.

widening and narrowing the bore at locations of pressure and velocity
anti nodes in the saxophone, not by moving the wall of the tube, but by
changing the volume of the closed toneholes in the vicinity.  This could
be done by stacking resonators to protrude more into the opening or
conversely making pads with a concave surface to enlarge the area.  Of
course adding to and taking away from the tonehole chimney is another
option, but it more difficult and would create problems on the stack
keys that are interrelated.

Again, not if you consider that the FAQ is specifically talking about
the fact that an incomplete cone with get its harmonics in line if a
suitable substitution is in place.

To bring the discussion back to a practical level, it seems to me that the
most important information to be derived from all of this is what are the
predicted effects of using a neck with a narrower or wider cone on a
saxophone.  The tenon end would, of course, be a fixed diameter, but the
taper to the tip could be enlarged or narrowed with the use of dent balls or
draw plates.  It is this type data that I am most interested in that can
possibly be used to improve the intonation and harmonicity of  existing
instruments.

Another thought I have been mulling over is to explore the effects of
widening and narrowing the bore at locations of pressure and velocity anti
nodes in the saxophone, not by moving the wall of the tube, but by changing
the volume of the closed toneholes in the vicinity.  This could be done by
stacking resonators to protrude more into the opening or conversely making
pads with a concave surface to enlarge the area.  Of course adding to and
taking away from the tonehole chimney is another option, but it more
difficult and would create problems on the stack keys that are interrelated.

There is no "correct substitution" term included. This formula does not
describe what happens when a mouthpiece of the correct volume

            <pre class='message__body'>
In all honesty, I suggest empirical experiment, because of the number of variables. In the shakuhachi world, we use small squares of wet paper, which stick to the inside of the bore but can be moved around with a stick. Putting such little perturbations of various sizes in different places in the
 bore allow one to immediately see (hear) what a corresponding constriction in that area would do, and you don&#39;t have to drill any "Ferron holes" to find the "sensitive harmonic spots". 

Of course this is only half the story, and we have a big advantage in shakuhachi making, since we can easily widen as well as narrow the bore. Generally speaking, if putting paper at a certain point makes tuning or response worse for the note(s) in question, we widen the bore slightly at that
 point. 

It is always difficult to know when the optimum has been reached, so as we widen, we continue to put the bits of paper in the bore, and when a bit of paper finally makes things better rather than worse, we stop and add just a bit of putty at that point.

With the sax neck this means a lot of hammering, and it is not a very nice prospect.

If putting paper in the bore at various spots helps the problem, then we are in better shape, since for shak we need only build up the inside at that point. With sax, one could actually use a permanent putty like car body putty in the spot where the bore needs narrowing.

Be aware that a small, deep perturbation--even if of the same volume as a larger, shallower one, will have a very different effect. An antinode might be a singular spot, but like a bell curve, there is a smooth buildup on either side.

As far as closed toneholes go, you need also know that the volume under a closed tonehole does not count the same for a pressure antinode and a displacement antinode. Air displacement tends to be along the axis of the bore, so for a displacement antinode changing the volume under a closed tonehole
 has much less effect that a smooth widening of the bore at that point. No so, however, for a pressure antinode. There is an exact formula for calculating the effect under a closed tonehole on pg 449 of FMA.

In an earlier mail, you speculated that changes in area high in the neck would not have an effect, since the harmonics with antinodes at that point are above cutoff frequency and thus do not contribute to the regime of oscillation. However that is not exactly accurate.

First, it is worth remembering that strong resonances in the tube above cutoff actually rob the vibrating system of energy as dynamics are increased and they come increasingly into play, so inhibiting them might actually change the sound output for the better. I am not sure about this, nor how
 much it might affect things, but there is a more germane point. Very small changes in diameter can have a very large effect on harmonics if the change in diameter is a significant fraction of a wavelength, since this can cause interference effects, either reinforcing or cancelling the partial in
 question. This is probably why very minor differences in head joint geometry in flutes give such different timbres and response, even if tuning is generally unaffected. There is no reason that the same kinds of effects would not pertain to the sax neck.

On this we agree, but a good mathematical approximation tells in what
general area to begin.

With the sax neck this means a lot of hammering, and it is not a very
nice prospect.

Actually the neck area can be contracted using epoxy putty and expanded
using dent balls.

Be aware that a small, deep perturbation--even if of the same volume as
a larger, shallower one, will have a very different effect. An
antinodemight be a singular spot, but like a bell curve, there is a
smooth buildup on either side.

Agreed.

Air displacement tends to be along the axis of the bore, so for a
displacement antinode changing the volume under a closed tonehole has
much less effect that a smooth widening of the bore at that point.No so,
however, for a pressure antinode.

Here you begin to lose me.  Can you explain this statement?

There is an exact formula forcalculating the effect under a closed
tonehole on pg 449 of FMA.

That formula in effect finds the factor (percent) that the tonehole
cavity enlarges the bore at that point similar to a bend in the tubing. 
I&#39;m not sure that even applies to the discussion of the effect of an
antinode in that area.

First, it is worth remembering that strong resonances in the tube above
cutoff actually rob the vibrating system of energy as dynamics
areincreased and they come increasingly into play, so inhibiting them
might actually change the sound output for the better.

What is your source for this information?  This is the first time I have
ever heard this statement.

Very small changes in diameter can have a very large effect on harmonics
if the change in diameter is a significant fraction of a wavelength,
since this can cause interference effects, either reinforcing or
canceling the partial in question.

You lose me again on this statement.  What interference effects are you
referring to and at what frequencies?

This is probably why very minor differences in head joint geometry in
flutes give such different timbres and response, even iftuning is
generally unaffected. There is no reason that the same kinds of effects
would not pertain to the sax neck.

This is interesting.  Are you referring to minor differences created
experimentally in the same flute headjoint or to two different
headjoints?  Wouldn&#39;t comparing the geometry of the blowhole and
strikeplate area be more similar to that of a sax mouthpiece rather than
a neck?

To bring the discussion back to a practical level, it seems to me that
the most important information to be derived from all of this is what
are the predicted effects of using a neck with a narrower or wider cone
on a

the taper to the tip could be enlarged or narrowed with the use of dent

On this we agree, but a good mathematical approximation tells in what general area to begin.

With the sax neck this means a lot of hammering, and it is not a very nice prospect.

Actually the neck area can be contracted using epoxy putty and expanded using dent balls.

Be aware that a small, deep perturbation--even if of the same volume as a larger, shallower one, will have a very different effect. An antinodemight be a singular spot, but like a bell curve, there is a smooth buildup on either side.

Agreed.

Air displacement tends to be along the axis of the bore, so for a displacement antinode changing the volume under a closed tonehole has much less effect that a smooth widening of the bore at that point.No so, however, for a pressure antinode. 

Here you begin to lose me.  Can you explain this statement?

There is an exact formula forcalculating the effect under a closed tonehole on pg 449 of FMA.

That formula in effect finds the factor (percent) that the tonehole cavity enlarges the bore at that point similar to a bend in the tubing.  I&#39;m not sure that even applies to the discussion of the effect of an antinode in that area.
Toby: No, the point is that the air in a tonehole is prevented from moving laterally because it is not in the main &#39;current&#39; so to speak. This means that when a tonehole is at a displacement antinode, the volume under the tonehole does not raise the frequency as much as it would if the same volume
 were in the main bore--such as expanding the walls of the tube at that point. This means that adding resos or trying to expand the volume somehow will not have as great an effect as you might expect, although clearly it will have some effect. 
Toy
First, it is worth remembering that strong resonances in the tube above cutoff actually rob the vibrating system of energy as dynamics are increased and they come increasingly into play, so inhibiting them might actually change the sound output for the better.

What is your source for this information?  This is the first time I have ever heard this statement.
Toby: Have a look at pg. 9 of the 1977 paper of  Benade: &#39;These are components that lie above cutoff and so do not have peaks to talk to, and as a result do not produce energy. They constitute a drag on the system, and so act to keep the playing level from rising further when the player tries to
 blow harder.&#39; 

Very small changes in diameter can have a very large effect on harmonics if the change in diameter is a significant fraction of a wavelength, since this can cause interference effects, either reinforcing or canceling the partial in question. 

You lose me again on this statement.  What interference effects are you referring to and at what frequencies?
This was mentioned in F&R. I will try to find the exact quote. They are talking about how very small geometrical changes can have a large influence on the the partials of a note. They say that when a geometrical change constitutes a significant portion of a partial&#39;s resonance curve, it can act to
 cancel or reinforce that particular partial, as if you introduced a second signal at that frequency either in or out of phase with the first, which could lead to reinforcement of the partial or cancellation.

This is probably why very minor differences in head joint geometry in flutes give such different timbres and response, even iftuning is generally unaffected. There is no reason that the same kinds of effects would not pertain to the sax neck.

This is interesting.  Are you referring to minor differences created experimentally in the same flute headjoint or to two different headjoints?  Wouldn&#39;t comparing the geometry of the blowhole and strikeplate area be more similar to that of a sax mouthpiece rather than a neck?  


Toby: Either. The contraction of the headjoint, the so-called &#39;parabolic&#39; curve, is there to widen the mode relationships, to offset the flattening of the second mode in which the player covers more of the embouchure hole and increases the end correction. However it was early noticed that very
 slight differences in this curve, although having nearly the same effect on the mode relationships, strongly affected the way the headjoint played and sounded. 
This is different from the difference in sound and response caused by different geometries of the embouchure hole. That indeed would be more analogous to the reed/mpc combo in the sax. The headjoint tube is more or less analogous to the neck in the sax, being the upper 1/3 or so of the bore.

 On this we agree, but a good mathematical approximation tells in what general area to begin.
 
 With the sax neck this means a lot of hammering, and it is not a very nice prospect.
 
 Actually the neck area can be contracted using epoxy putty and expanded using dent balls.

 Agreed.

 Here you begin to lose me.  Can you explain this statement?

 First, it is worth remembering that strong resonances in the tube above cutoff actually rob the vibrating system of energy as dynamics are increased and they come increasingly into play, so inhibiting them might actually change the sound output for the better.
 
 What is your source for this information?  This is the first time I have ever heard this statement.
Toby: Have a look at pg. 9 of the 1977 paper of  Benade: &#39;These are components that lie above cutoff and so do not have  peaks to talk to, and as a result do not produce energy. They constitute a drag on the system, and so act to keep the playing level from rising further when the player  tries to
 blow harder.&#39; 
 
 Very small changes in diameter can have a very large effect on harmonics if the change in diameter is a significant fraction of a wavelength, since this can cause interference effects, either reinforcing or canceling the partial in question. 
 
 You lose me again on this statement.  What interference effects are you referring to and at what frequencies?
This was mentioned in F&R. I will try to find the exact quote. They are talking about how very small geometrical  changes can have a large influence on the the partials of a note. They say that when a geometrical change constitutes a significant portion of a partial&#39;s resonance curve, it can act
 to cancel or reinforce that particular partial, as if you introduced a second signal at that frequency either in  or out of phase with the first, which could lead to reinforcement of the partial or cancellation.
 
 This is probably why very minor differences in head joint geometry in flutes give such different timbres and response, even iftuning is generally unaffected. There is no reason that the same kinds of effects would not pertain to the sax neck.
 
 This is interesting.  Are you referring to minor differences created experimentally in the same flute headjoint or to two different headjoints?  Wouldn&#39;t comparing the geometry of the blowhole and strikeplate area be more similar to that of a sax mouthpiece rather  than a neck?  
 

 Toby: Either. The contraction of the headjoint, the so-called &#39;parabolic&#39; curve, is there to widen the mode relationships, to offset the flattening of the second mode in which the player covers more of the embouchure hole and increases the  end correction. However it was early noticed that very
 slight differences in this curve, although having nearly the same effect on the mode relationships, strongly affected the way the headjoint played and sounded. 
This is different from the difference in sound and response caused by different geometries of the embouchure hole. That indeed would be more analogous to the reed/mpc combo in the sax. The headjoint tube is more or less  analogous to the neck in the sax, being the upper 1/3 or so of the bore.

Do you think this is in conflict with Benade&#39;s statement? I don&#39;t. There may be displacement, but not at the levels that it would be inside the bore.

First, it is worth remembering that strong resonances in the tube above
cutoff actually rob the vibrating system of energy as dynamics are increased
and they come increasingly into play, so inhibiting them might actually
change the sound output for the better.

What is your source for this information?  This is the first time I have
ever heard this statement.

Toby: Have a look at pg. 9 of the 1977 paper of  Benade: &#39;These are
components that lie above cutoff and so do not have peaks to talk to, and as
a result do not produce energy. They constitute a drag on the system, and so
act to keep the playing level from rising further when the player tries to
blow harder.&#39; 

Very small changes in diameter can have a very large effect on harmonics if
the change in diameter is a significant fraction of a wavelength, since this
can cause interference effects, either reinforcing or canceling the partial
in question. 

You lose me again on this statement.  What interference effects are you
referring to and at what frequencies?

This was mentioned in F&R. I will try to find the exact quote. They are
talking about how very small geometrical changes can have a large influence
on the the partials of a note. They say that when a geometrical change
constitutes a significant portion of a partial&#39;s resonance curve, it can act
to cancel or reinforce that particular partial, as if you introduced a
second signal at that frequency either in or out of phase with the first,
which could lead to reinforcement of the partial or cancellation.

This is probably why very minor differences in head joint geometry in flutes
give such different timbres and response, even iftuning is generally
unaffected. There is no reason that the same kinds of effects would not
pertain to the sax neck.

This is interesting.  Are you referring to minor differences created
experimentally in the same flute headjoint or to two different headjoints?
Wouldn&#39;t comparing the geometry of the blowhole and strikeplate area be more
similar to that of a sax mouthpiece rather than a neck?  


Toby: Either. The contraction of the headjoint, the so-called &#39;parabolic&#39;
curve, is there to widen the mode relationships, to offset the flattening of
the second mode in which the player covers more of the embouchure hole and
increases the end correction. However it was early noticed that very slight
differences in this curve, although having nearly the same effect on the
mode relationships, strongly affected the way the headjoint played and
sounded. 

This is different from the difference in sound and response caused by
different geometries of the embouchure hole. That indeed would be more
analogous to the reed/mpc combo in the sax. The headjoint tube is more or
less analogous to the neck in the sax, being the upper 1/3 or so of the
bore.

I’m sorry, but at this point in the proceedings I just
gotta ask:  

   

HAVE YOU GUYS ACTUALLY BUILT ANYTHING OR DO YOU JUST TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOU HAVE READ? If  you have actually built something, is it commercially
available so we can all check it out? There seems to be seemingly endless
discussion, but very little product production…….

Hi John,

On this we agree, but a good mathematical
approximation tells in what general area to begin.



With the sax neck this means a lot of hammering, and
it is not a very nice prospect.



Actually the neck area can be contracted using epoxy putty and expanded using
dent balls.



Be aware that a small, deep perturbation- -even if of
the same volume as a larger, shallower one, will have a very different effect.
An antinodemight be a singular spot, but like a bell curve, there is a smooth
buildup on either side.



Agreed.



Air displacement tends to be along the axis of the
bore, so for a displacement antinode changing the volume under a closed tonehole
has much less effect that a smooth widening of the bore at that point.No so,
however, for a pressure antinode. 



Here you begin to lose me.  Can you explain this statement?



There is an exact formula forcalculating the effect
under a closed tonehole on pg 449 of FMA.



That formula in effect finds the factor (percent) that the tonehole cavity
enlarges the bore at that point similar to a bend in the tubing.  I&#39;m not
sure that even applies to the discussion of the effect of an antinode in that
area. 





Toby: No, the
point is that the air in a tonehole is prevented from moving laterally because
it is not in the main &#39;current&#39; so to speak. This means that when a tonehole is
at a displacement antinode, the volume under the tonehole does not raise the
frequency as much as it would if the same volume were in the main bore--such as
expanding the walls of the tube at that point. This means that adding resos or
trying to expand the volume somehow will not have as great an effect as you
might expect, although clearly it will have some effect.

Benade FMA p.474

Contracting the bore at a pressure antinode raises the pitch.
Explanding the bore at a pressure antinode lowers the pitch (implied).

Contracting the bore at a velocity (displacement) antinode lowers the
pitch.
Expanding the bore at a velocity (displacement) antinode raises the
pitch (implied).

He also says writes that bore changes at a pressure node or velocity
node will have no effect upon the frequency.

Various diagrams of the soundwaves in woodwinds seem to indicate that
for cylindrical instruments the pressure antinodes are at the same
location as the velocity nodes, and that the velocity antinodes are at
the same location as the pressure nodes.

In conical instruments this seems to be the case as one moves to the
higher harmonics.  Is there an explanation for this apparent
contradiction?

How does one interpret Benade&#39;s statement when the pressure antinode and the velocity node are at the same location?
