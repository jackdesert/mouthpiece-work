            <pre class='message__body'>Next week I will be ordering feeler gage sets for myself and anyone else who is interested.
The set I&#39;m ordering is a 12 feeler set in the sizes Mojo uses:

.0015
.050
.010
.017
.026
.037
.049
.063
.078
.093
.109
.125

This is a more complete set than anything I&#39;m aware of on the market, and it&#39;s complete with larger sizes too, so you can accurately measure very open tenor and baritone mouthpieces.

The price for ordering only one set would be $300. However, the more sets you order the lower the unit price.

I already have 4 sets spoken for, which brings the cost per set down to $140. And if enough people are interested in sets (16 more), the cost per set could be just $100. Expect an additional charge to cover my shipping costs ($6 at most).

If anyone else is interested in getting in on this e-mail me at mw@mikewilkens.com with "Feeler Gage" in the subject line and include the number of sets you want.

I&#39;m not making any money from this, I only want to get a good deal for anyone interested.

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>It is about time someone stepped up and did this again.  When I did it I think I had about 10 spoken for so I took a chance and ordered 20 or so.  Took me a couple of years to sell out.  Since I have put my videos up on YouTube, I get a lot of requests Emailed to me for feelers and glass gauges.

I ordered mine in stainless steel.  But this material was only available for the smaller half of the size range.  Those small sizes are used on every mouthpiece and they can take a beating.

I also ordered two of the .0015" size since it is a fragile thickness.  But I am still using my first one after many years.  So I&#39;m not sure if I would do that again.

I did not specify my edge shape from Eastern.  Most came squared off enough but a few were rounded a bit too much.  I ended up sanding these down by hand which took a long time.  I had a friend who offered to kill the edges but I did not pursue this.  It would be worth asking Eastern if they could provide a uniform square edge.  If they are too sharp it is easy to sand them a little to break the edge.

I tried to explain this, and I think he understood what I meant, but I&#39;d rather be safe than sorry.

Unfortunately I&#39;m not in a position right now to invest in 20 sets... I&#39;ve been spending too much money on mouthpieces lately! :S But if anyone is interested in sets now, please give them my e-mail address. I&#39;ll happily order for anyone currently seeking a set.

Thanks,

Just ordered a set for $6, including shipping.  Not stainless, but not $300.  My other set did rust after 20 years, but it was my fault for getting it wet (using wet emory paper for finishing) and not drying it off.  That set now goes in the automotive tools.  

I like this style because it&#39;s easy to remove the blades that you don&#39;t use (or remove the ones you use if you like to use just the blades).  Probably should have ordered two sets, saved on shipping, and then I&#39;d spend half as much time looking for the feelers on my bench.  

http://www.ebay.com/itm/190780914468?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649

With the $294 I saved, I can buy 15 hard rubber pieces to refinish.  Just what I need is 15 more mouthpieces.

But my set does go up to .035.  .018 on top of .017.  With the blades stacked up, it goes to .328, thick enough for measuring the most sadomasochistic contrabass piece.  

I&#39;ve always assumed that the seemingly random thicknesses used in measuring faces are the result of the ease of stacking certain blades.  .093 is used because it&#39;s a stack of .013 through .018. Good enough for the oldtimers, good enough for me.  Besides, I&#39;d bet the weakest links (at least for me) are eyesight, carelessness, glass gauge accuracy, surface cleanliness, followed by gauge accuracy way, way down on the list.

No, stacking feelers is not consistent.  The thicknesses used are to give readings at certain places along the curve.  The .0015" to give the total facing length, the .010" the "break", the others give more measurements along the facing.  Not random at all.

The use of .031" vs. .035" is more from feeler availability.  Both give a good measurement at about the right spot along the facing, will measure slightly differently, but serve the purpose.

That is correct, sort of.  The thickest individual blade in my set is .025, which is common.  But a feeler gauge set can measure higher, as I stated.  To measure .035, you simply use both the .018 and .017 blade at the same time.  No need to buy all the unused blades between .024 and .035.  To measure .063, you stack .020, .021, and .022.  And so on.  

It is common practice with machinists to use feeler gauges in this way.  If you want to measure .0335, you don&#39;t need to have a special custom feeler blade made that is .0335 thick, you simply stack the appropriate blades (.025, .007, .0015, for instance).  Using blades that are close together in the group is easier and might give a more accurate reading, so I&#39;d probably use .017, .015, .0015 for that measurement.

A custom .0335 blade would probably cost several hundred dollars and it can only measure that particular thickness.  A standard feeler set is $6 and allows you to measure hundreds of thicknesses starting at .0015 in increments of .0005 and going above a quarter inch. An individual blade set that does that weigh several pounds and would cost what?  $2,000?  $4,000?  That difference buys a lot of mouthpiece blanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Mark,
I don&#39;t agree with you on few instances. It is easy to buy a set having
.035 feeler gauge.
Here is one on Amazon:
http://www.amazon.com/Lisle-68100-Deluxe-Feeler-Gauge/dp/B0009OMY9C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1364238348&sr=8-2&keywords=feeler+gauge
Stacking them will not give you accurate measure. There is a not so
expensive way to find the ticker feelers.
I have to make some search and I will send a link.

If you want to measure .0335, you don&#39;t need to have a special custom feeler blade made that is .0335 thick, you simply stack the appropriate blades (.025, .007, .0015, for instance). Using blades that are close together in the group is easier and might give a more accurate reading, so I&#39;d probably use .017, .015, .0015 for that measurement.

A standard feeler set is $6 and allows you to measure hundreds of thicknesses starting at .0015 in increments of .0005 and going above a quarter inch. An individual blade set that does that weigh several pounds and would cost what? $2,000? $4,000? That difference buys a lot of mouthpiece blanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>Stacking feelers works in some applications, like gapping spark plugs.  But I found that it was not good for mouthpiece facing.  The feelers need to be clamped together or they might read large. 

 I tried taping some sets together and even crazy glueing.  I then measured the glued stacks.  This kinda worked for a while but there was some taper issues and when a stack became unglued it was a pain.

            <pre class='message__body'>.035 sets are common, but if you look closely, most of them don&#39;t have every blade between .025 and .035.  

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Snap-on-FB316A-Feeler-Gauge-010-035-/130874547656?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1e78bb1dc8&vxp=mtr

Why doesn&#39;t the set include every blade between .025 and .035? Because it&#39;s common to simply stack blades to get the "missing" blades.  Keith&#39;s right that stacking .017 and .018 might not be as accurate as having a single .035 blade, but thousands of great mouthpieces have been produced by stacking blades (and the I think that the Brand scale is proof of that).  

I know from my limited experience reading the glass gauge is more likely to to cause an inaccuracy than my stacked feelers being off by .0003. For me, the standard set fills the bill.  Were I a professional mp person using feelers for eight hours a day, I&#39;d spring for individual blades.  Right now, I could screw up a mouthpiece even using the world&#39;s best feelers.
