Recording to a PC, go into the Line In jack on the sound card from a mixer.  What?  You don&#39;t have a mixer?  There are a number of good 4-6 mic mixers.  And you should already have some good mics... Shure 58 is just fine, XLR from mic to mixer.  Then an adapter cable down to a 1/8" (3.5mm) stereo plug.

OK, what about USB?  I use a tiny external soundcard called an iMic from Griffin Technologies.  There are others that look like a thumbdrive.  These have 1/8" jacks.  

I use a mic on a floor stand to the mixer (I use the mixer portion of my PA head) to the iMic, into the USB port of my laptop.

These will work fine:

http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?Partnumber$8-584

http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?Partnumber$8-818

You will just need stereo RCA plug Y-cable to 1/8" stereo plug to go from the output of these mixers to the iMic or other USB external sound card.  You cannot record into the mic input of a laptop.  The levels are too different and you will have distortion.

You can&#39;t easily lug a PC to a gig, but a laptop, no problem.

I use a free-shareware called Goldwave, from Goldwave.com.  While at the site find and also download/install Lame32, which is an MP3 encoder.  This will allow you to have the option to Save As an MP3 if desired, instead of the much larger WAV file.

If you want to do your own multitrack, "sound on sound" recording (a la Les Paul and Mary Ford), for example, recording your own sax quartets, a multitrack program is what you need.  I have PowerTracks 10 from the same people that have Band-In-A-Box, www.pgmusic.com.  This is a virtual 48 track recording desk.

If you are going to record, use a good mic.

The sound is pretty decent, but not studio quality. If all you want to do is play test a mouthpiece, it would be a good device for that job. The biggest advantage is portability.

Since Kieth&#39;s plan is to do simple recordings, I still say that a USB mic would be the least complicated with good results. No need for a mixer or audio interface. Just Mic->Cable->Computer. 

b&h photo has a nice page with some commentary on the mics they carry: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=getpage&kw=ART-USBMics&Q=newsLetter/pro_audio_may07/pro_audio_usb_mic_guide_may07.jsp&O= 

sweetwater has a good selection too: http://www.sweetwater.com/c981--USB_Mics 

they also have a USB mic tutorial that references Audacity: http://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/techlib/support/USB_Microphone_Guide.pdf

quality will be as good as the microphone setup allows. The built in mikes
are good, but of course one can do better.

For my own purposes (recording band gigs and sessions for subsequent
evaluation) I&#39;ve just bought the Sony UX70, which records in stereo via
built in microphones direct to 192kbps mp3.  These run about $60.

The device acts like a USB drive - easy to get sound files from it

You can use either the H4 mics or the 2 inputs (for better mics)(has phantom
power).

Also has a nice headphone out for zero-latency monitoring. :)

It&#39;s also a pretty decent 4-track recorder with built-in effects and mic
modeling.

have fun!

If you have to mic a saxophone, the rest of the band is TOO LOUD!

Quality may be lower than "good mic to PC" setup, but it is very good, and super convenient.  I use it to record gigs all the time.  I paid about $160 (some super-duper sale from Sweetwater a while back).

Here is another idea: Buy a Zoom H2 micro recorder. These things are great. You can record right into the device, and sync it up later with your PC. The sound is pretty decent, but not studio quality. If all you want to do is play test a mouthpiece, it would be a good device for that job. The biggest advantage is portability. You can take it anywhere and don&#39;t need to haul a computer around.

The street price of these things is around $250.

Since Kieth&#39;s plan is to do simple recordings, I still say that a USB mic would be the least complicated with good results. No need for a mixer or audio interface. Just Mic->Cable->Computer.

b&h photo has a nice page with some commentary on the mics they carry: http://www.bhphotov ideo.com/ bnh/controller/ home?A=getpage&kw=ART-USBMics&Q=newsLetter/ pro_audio_ may07/pro_ audio_usb_ mic_guide_ may07.jsp&O=

sweetwater has a good selection too: http://www.sweetwat er.com/c981- -USB_Mics

they also have a USB mic tutorial that references Audacity: http://www.sweetwat er.com/sweetcare /techlib/ support/USB_ Microphone_ Guide.pdf

            <pre class='message__body'>Reading Nederveen again. He says:

"In two places, tenor and alto saxophones have bends in
the bore. The crook in the upper part of the bore shows
very low curvature and does not exercise any appreciable
influence..."

So I was right the first time. Now I have no idea what he
was talking about when he said that bore perturbations in
the neck and upper part of the body render the mimicking
of the volume a moot point as regards good intonation.
