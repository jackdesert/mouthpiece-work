Well, I do know that the window is not allowed to extend farther than 
the facing!  Usually a long window makes for a louder sound.  The 
drawback is, that long windows have more of a reed-sealing problem 
than a short window.  I would not think that the window length would 
affect intonation.  However, if Van Wie did say that it does, I would 
respect his opinion.  BTW: the chamber size should be about equal in 
volume, to the volume of the missing cone of the neck piece.-- David K

            <pre class='message__body'>Mike, the Benade papers are heavy duty study... get the coffee pot
plugged in.  All the math is there, if you can digest it... or do as I
do, and skip to the conclusions.

Most of it has to do with acoustics of the clarinet.  It might be good
to point out that Benade was a physicist, and a clarinetist.  But
modeling a clarinet is easier, just a cylinder.  However, most of his
conclusions are applicable to sax, too.

There is a good paper in there somewhere about concert halls, and one on
how the lungs, throat, mouth affect tone and pitch.

These are the most extensive, scientific, studies on woodwind acoustics
I know of.  I would like to thank Steve Goodson (www.saxgourmet.com),
and fellow Sax On The Web columnist, for turning me on to the Benade
papers.

There is also a paper at Stanford by Gary Scavone.  This is his doctoral
thesis, and you should find it (via a search on the stanford site) and
read it, too.

There is a chapter on mouthpieces in the Larry Teal "The Art Of
Saxophone Playing", and a discussion of mouthpieces/reeds in Ernest
Ferron&#39;s "The Saxophone Is My Voice".  Ferron goes a little further and
discusses how a hard reed on a long, narrow facing works to give a
darker tone, and a softer reed, on a shorter, wider facing, gives a
brighter tone.

Here in our archives are a pdf file, a three part column by Santy Runyon
(www.runyonproducts.com) in the old Woodwind World magazine from 1960.
He talks of the effects of facing length, tip opening, various contours
of facing, chambers, baffles, and all.  There was a five or six part
series by Santy Runyon in the old Woodwind magazine, c. 1952-53.  The
exact issues and page numbers are in the bibliography of older printings
Larry Teal&#39;s "The Art Of Saxophone Playing."  However, newer printings
have left out the bibliography altogether.  In speaking with Santy, he
told me that most of Teal&#39;s chapter on mouthpieces was actually based on
interviews in his studio in Chicago; Larry Teal had driven over from Ann
Arbor, MI for those interviews.  Santy, at nearly 96 years old, remains
a wonderful source of priceless information of all things saxophone,
especially mouthpieces.  He continues to design new mouthpieces and
other products for his company, Runyon Products.

Jon Van Wie has good information on his site, www.jonvanwie.com.

Go and kiss your wife now, because if you start reading all this, you
won&#39;t be finished until next year.  Hah!

            <pre class='message__body'>Windows can be much longer than the facing length.  Check out the 
Rovner pieces.  They work, but I do not see where extra long windows 
are an advantage.

If you lengthen a window on an existing piece it makes the chamber 
larger.  Perhaps that is the intonation effect JVW was commenting on.

As for the various papers and link to what is out there, be sure to 
look on the Mouthpiece Work site under "Links> Literature..".  The 
link to the Scavone paper is there as well as links to several other 
ones.

I am thinking that if the Rovner pieces have such long windows (past 
the facing) that the advantage is the ease of manufacturing.  That is, 
the opening allows a CNC mill to get into and at, the chamber and 
bafle, with various metal cutters, as would be impossible with a small 
window.

I&#39;ll buy that.  But I can not see/hear a significant playing advantage.
