            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve had a blast working with this Rico Graftonite soprano piece. 
Now, I&#39;m trying to see how close I can get it to the sound of the 
Dukoff D8. The Dukoff&#39;s have a distinctive buzz that I haven&#39;t seen 
in any other mouthpiece. Is there one particular feature that gives 
the Dukoff that sound? I figured it was a combination of the baffle 
(rollover into elongated step baffle) and the bullet chamber that 
gave it its sound. 

Last night, I tried putting a rolover baffle on the Rico. Not an easy 
feat but I think I&#39;m there. Its got a good buzz but not as pronounced 
as the Dukoff.  The highest part of my baffle is about 2.5mm behind 
the tip - I couldn&#39;t get it any closer without it interfering with 
the reed. When I looked at the Dukoff again, it didn&#39;t really seem to 
have a rollover baffle but the baffle is very close to the reed for 
about 2mm behind the tip. As a matter of fact, the tip rail isn&#39;t 
very well defined because it blends in with the baffle. Is this 
typical of all recent Dukoff D-series mouthpieces?

I think I&#39;ve done a good job at duplicating the chamber, ramp and 
main part of the baffle. All have dimensions very close to the 
Dukoff. It is the tip that seems very hard to do.   

This is the third Dukoff that I tried and I do have trouble with the 
occasional reed chirp that I don&#39;t get with other mouthpieces. I 
tried two other Dukoffs that were much worse with the chirping 
(unplayable) and the folks who sold them to me took them back. Is it 
possible that that this one has a defect as well?

Last of all, what qualities in a ligature do I look for? I&#39;ve had 
trouble with ligatures in the past and so I&#39;ve always stuck a thin 
rubber pad in between the lig and the reed to help balance out the 
pressure applied to the reed. Right now, I don&#39;t even use a real 
ligature but am using cold shrink wrap tape to hold the reed in 
place. I wash the mouthpiece out with the reed on it after I play and 
leave the reed on it all the time. This works amazingly better than 
the ligs that came with my mouthpieces. It makes it difficult to 
change out reeds but I&#39;m heading towards synthetic reeds anyway. What 
do you think of using the shrink wrap?

Thanks for tollerating new old newbie&#39;s questions!

            <pre class='message__body'>There are several factors that cause chirping.  First, if there is a lot of
resistance in the piece, this causes the player to build up a lot more
pressure to get the reed to speak.  The additional pressure is fuel for
generating chirps.  Making a piece more free blowing reduces the need to
force it to make it play.  Related to this is uneveness in the tip rail and
where the side rails meet the tip rail.  This adds resistance and a place
for the reed to vibrate at those high chirp frequencies.  High roll-over
baffles near the tip rail are also prone to chirps.  Relieving just a
little off the baffle near the tip rail can do wonders here.

I have not seen and Dukoff sopranos, but they probably vary a lot like the
tenors do.  The Tenor Dukoff Ds do not typically have a high roll-over
baffle.  They just have the step baffle or dual-action wedge.

A ligature that allows the reed to respond quickly might help reduce
chirps.  Again, less pressure needed to drive the reed.  If your piece is
very sensitive to ligature placement, this could be an indication that the
table has a high spot.

            <pre class='message__body'>Just a note to add to what Keith says. Apparently chirps and squeaks are caused by the reed twisting around its longitudinal axis. You want the reed to move up and down as a unit and stay parallel to the tip rail. In addition to what Keith mentioned, uneven side rails tend to impart a twist to the reed as it rolls along them to close the tip. This increases the chance that the reed will go into a flexing mode where each side touches the tip rail alternately and causes a squeak or chirp. So even side and tip rails are very important to help prevent them.

Keith, I am interested in what you mean by a lig that allows the reed to respond quickly. I&#39;m of the school that says that the lig is just a clamp as long as it does that its purpose is served. End of story.

As for home made ligatures, they are fine as long as they work for you and
you can get repeatable results.

I like Winslows, but you need to want to spend a couple of hours
experimenting with the different arrangements.  I like Rovner Lights and
Mark IIIs for their low cost and simple usage.  If a Winslow is my 10, the
Rovners are a 9.5.  I have a Vandoren Optimum that also works great on
alto.
I have not tried them all.  I&#39;m happy enough with what I have I do not plan to.

            <pre class='message__body'>Traditionally clarinet mpcs in Europe are designed to be used not with ligs but with string which is wrapped around the body and across the reed. Some people use velcro because it is quicker.

John Backus from USC--one of the top researchers in the field and an accomplished clarinetist himself--wrote that the part of the reed past the player&#39;s mouth does not vibrate more than the clarinet body itself. This would signify that if we are dealing with a flat table upon which different ligs do not position the reed differently vis-a-vis the tip the lig would make no difference to the response of the reed.

I realize that this is a totally contentious subject, and I suppose by now everyone in the group could have guessed what my opinion on the subject would be ;-)

The best thing is to try out different options for yourself--try your shrink wrap (how do you get it on and off???), try string and rubber bands (also very good) and duct tape and Rovners and whatever and see what differences you find. Be sure to position the reed the same each time. I personally have found the differences between these methods of reed clamping miniscule at best, but some people swear by one method or another.

FWIW,

Toby

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith and Toby for the info on ligatures. I&#39;ve
always been of the opinion that anything that holds
the reed secure and flat to the table makes a good
lig. But then I&#39;ve read people who say "this lig is
dark" or "this lig is much brighter sounding" -- it
has made me wonder.

My second attempt at dup[licating the Dukoff baffle
was successful. I am so pleased with my "Dukoff
replica" that I made from the Rico Graftonite that I
just ordered Rico&#39;s for both my alto and tenor (only
14.95 each from www.muscistoreinc.com). These
mouthpieces are great for experimenting with baffles
and chambers. You have to be careful because the
plastic is a bit soft and doesn&#39;t like heat at all.

FWIW, I have a Dukoff P8 on which the tip rail is more-or-less inferred, like
they simply polished the end of the baffle to make it look like a tip rail.  But
that could be from wear.

I can&#39;t play on it -- somehow I used it (prob. due to overeagerness) when I
started playing the sax again, but I don&#39;t know how I got any useful sound out
of it.  Come to think of it I only used it for a few months.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you were to get a good little file and get rid of the rollover leaving a well-defined and thin tip rail with some breathing space behind it you might find that your Dukoff becomes suddenly very well behaved. This will take a bit of the very high edge off but will also smooth and deepen the timbre (in my experience). I have seen/played a few Dukoffs and while I think they have a great sound--very characteristic and loud--the quality control leaves something to be desired. You should check out the evenness of the side and tip rails too.

 >>I am interested in what you mean by a lig that allows the reed to respond quickly. I&#39;m of the school that says that the lig is just a clamp as long as it does that its purpose is served&lt;&lt;
My experience is that there is a LOT of difference between the standard two-screw metal band ligature and the type which is composed of flexible composite rubber  which supports the reed, wraps around the mouthpiece and is held together with a single screw (e.g. Rovner). 
This particular Rovner ligature causes the reed to respond in a much different fashion from the way in which the standard two-screw metal band ligature does. FOR ME (individuals&#39; experiences may vary), the Rovner allows for a faster response and demands a much looser, dropped-jaw embouchure. FOR ME, this ligature allows for fewer variations in embouchure. This ligature makes me prone to producing squeaks. Why this is, I have no idea. This characteristic is evident on every mouthpiece I have ever used it on.
I started out as a clarinetist, then picked up the also sax and played it with a double embouchure (upper and lower lips covering the upper and lower teeth). Then I took up the oboe (another instrument which required an ungodly kind of double embouchure). Simultaneously, I took up the bari sax and played that with a pretty tight double embouchure. ( ! ) (When I began playing professionally, I dropped the oboe from my repertoire and concentrated upon the tenor and soprano)
Once, I too regarded the ligature as something which merely held the reed in place. I bought a couple of Rovners and used them on several different mouthpieces (some stock, some customized) and found their effects upon response  to be quite different from the standard two- screw ligature.
Which ligature do I play on now? The standard two screw metal ligature. Why? Because I find that although it causes the reed to respond more slowly and with a bit more effort, it DOES allow me to change my embouchure while playing, which IMHO, is necessary for playing the saxophone. I couldn&#39;t relate to the unevenness of scale issues until I tried the Rovner which FOR ME requires a very consistent, unchanging embouchure. I couldn&#39;t compensate for the inherent unevenness of scale of the saxophone except by resorting to exotic (and sometimes experimental) alternate fingerings. 
Rovners are quite popular, and apparently quite good for lots of folks. They just don&#39;t work for me. Now, whenever I get a mouthpiece that "comes with" a Rovner, I either throw it in a drawer, or (if it&#39;s a store-bought mouthpiece) I ask for the stock two-screw ligature that is usually supplied with most mouthpieces. I can usually talk the store into a sixteen dollar credit for the Rovner.

They are less significant than your choice of reed.  

They are less significant than a choice of sax (but are less expensive, so
try ligs before switching saxes).  

They are more significant than the difference between a decent Runyon
Custom and Jody Jazz.

They are far less significant than the difference between a good and bad
Dukoff. 

So, you get an idea where I&#39;m splitting my hairs here.

            <pre class='message__body'>Basically, some ligs darken the sound, others allow the reed to vibrate
with more freedom. Certain mpcs work better or differently with a
different lig. As for string ligs, they work but wether they are any
better or not is entirely dependant upon the player and what they
believe.

Personally, I use Rovner lites or Bonade two screw metal ligs, standard
ligs on other mpcs. It doesn&#39;t matter which lig it is provided it holds
the reed on properly and doesn&#39;t force embouchure movements to play the
given set-up. Altering your embouchure whilst playing will slow you
down, stuff up your intonation and not allow you to play two or three
octave leaps with ease. Also altering the embouchure whilst playing is
indicative of a lack of of air support.

Dukoffs are highly inconsistent but a good Dukoff can be a very, very
nice mpc but finding or creating one is a great challenge.

Man, I really dislike Rovner ligatures. It must just be me. For me, the difference between a Rovner and a traditional, metal two-screw ligature is quite a lot. I&#39;ve never been one for trendy stuff, and I am skeptical about the relative advantages of x horn over y horn and that kind of thing. Mouthpiece problems, however, can set me off as fast as a leaky pad can.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ahh, yes, the old string ligature.  I remember them from my college
days, popular with clarinetists.  They play fine, but have one problem�
changing reeds quickly!!!  A Rovner is surely quick and easy when it
comes to switching reeds.

For oddball size mouthpieces I have also used a common, ordinary, nylon
Ty-wrap� a brand name for electrical cable ties.  Since the mouthpiece
is conical in the area where a ligature will fit, tighten the Ty-wrap
near the upper end of that range, then slip it down the mouthpiece until
snug.  Position the �knot� of the tywrap on top, so that the reed is
supported evenly by the nylon strap.  The excess may be cut off, and
this lig may be reused.

If I were a band director, I would keep half a dozen Ty-wraps in my
repair kit.  I usually have a few in my goodie bag for gigs.

Yes, once our bari player dropped his lig while assembling his sax, and
someone else came along and stepped on it.  Ty-wrap to the rescue!

            <pre class='message__body'>I have to admit to formerly being a ligature skeptic� until I tried a
Winslow.  Yes, response seemed quicker, high notes a little freer.  Not
a lot, and maybe not audible to others� but it does seem to play better.

I don�t notice any playing improvement with Rovners, but what I do like
with them is their easy and fast use.  They support the reed evenly,
without slipping, and are fast with reed changes.  That is all I could
want from a ligature.

But the playing improvements I found in the Winslow are an unexpected
bonus.  I agree with others, ligatures as far as playing improvement
might be mouthpiece/reed specific.

And one more thing� If I get ONE MORE letter from a high school kid,
wondering if a gold plated lig will cure all of his problems� and
magically make his horn respond better, tone warmer, he can run faster
and jump higher�.  Well, calm down, Paul!

My experience is that finish and color of the lig make no difference.

            <pre class='message__body'>I am interested in what you mean by a lig that allows the reed to respond quickly. I&#39;m of the school that says that the lig is just a clamp as long as it does that its purpose is served&lt;&lt;
My experience is that there is a LOT of difference between the standard two-screw metal band ligature and the type which is composed of flexible composite rubber  which supports the reed, wraps around the mouthpiece and is held together with a single screw (e.g. Rovner). 
This particular Rovner ligature causes the reed to respond in a much different fashion from the way in which the standard two-screw metal band ligature does. FOR ME (individuals&#39; experiences may vary), the Rovner allows for a faster response and demands a much looser, dropped-jaw embouchure. FOR ME, this ligature allows for fewer variations in embouchure. This ligature makes me prone to producing squeaks. Why this is, I have no idea. This characteristic is evident on every mouthpiece I have ever used it on.
I started out as a clarinetist, then picked up the also sax and played it with a double embouchure (upper and lower lips covering the upper and lower teeth). Then I took up the oboe (another instrument which required an ungodly kind of double embouchure). Simultaneously, I took up the bari sax and played that with a pretty tight double embouchure. ( ! ) (When I began playing professionally, I dropped the oboe from my repertoire and concentrated upon the tenor and soprano)
Once, I too regarded the ligature as something which merely held the reed in place. I bought a couple of Rovners and used them on several different mouthpieces (some stock, some customized) and found their effects upon response  to be quite different from the standard two- screw ligature.
Which ligature do I play on now? The standard two screw metal ligature. Why? Because I find that although it causes the reed to respond more slowly and with a bit more effort, it DOES allow me to change my embouchure while playing, which IMHO, is necessary for playing the saxophone. I couldn&#39;t relate to the unevenness of scale issues until I tried the Rovner which FOR ME requires a very consistent, unchanging embouchure. I couldn&#39;t compensate for the inherent unevenness of scale of the saxophone except by resorting to exotic (and sometimes experimental) alternate fingerings. 
Rovners are quite popular, and apparently quite good for lots of folks. They just don&#39;t work for me. Now, whenever I get a mouthpiece that "comes with" a Rovner, I either throw it in a drawer, or (if it&#39;s a store-bought mouthpiece) I ask for the stock two-screw ligature that is usually supplied with most mouthpieces. I can usually talk the store into a sixteen dollar credit for the Rovner.
---------------------------

Hi! I came to the same conclusion..Rovners or Winslows make the sound really fat, but I feel not the hights created by a normal two screw metall ligature any more..This is a problem, then I start to change embouchure to adjust.. I think I need this high frequencies for microtuning, I cannot controll this so good on the Winslow/rovner etc... I own an old Brilhart lig on alto and Tenor, it´s already better, especially while putting it inverse on the mouthpiece (same thing on alto and tenor). Has anybody the same impression?
Any good advice how to adjust the winslow for creating a maximum of brillance?
I´m interested in the Vandoren optimum and the Francois Louis ligatures, any advice? 
This discussion is great, I recorded me last week with a bunch of ligs on the same mouthpiece, the difference is overhelming...

Many greetings,Chriss

makes a vast amount of difference. I&#39;ve tried pretty much all of the exotic

significant advantage to one style or another, so long as it holds the reed

manufacture, and I can&#39;t tell the difference when using the same mouthpiece

real research? There seems to be a great deal of snake oil being sold along

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Ligatures

  
I keep going back and forth on this issue. I’m not convinced the ligature makes a vast amount of difference. I’ve tried pretty much all of the exotic varieties at one time or another, and just don’t find there to be a real significant advantage to one style or another, so long as it holds the reed securely in place. I use three different styles on my mouthpieces that we manufacture, and I can’t tell the difference when using the same mouthpiece and reed, changing only the ligature. I’d be interested in any real data on this topic, not anecdotal comments or pseudo-science. Is anyone aware of any real research? There seems to be a great deal of snake oil being sold along with ligatures, or maybe I’m missing something.

The lig could make a difference if the table is not flat, or if it compresses the fibers of the reed butt or if it otherwise alters the relationship of the reed tip to the rails where the action is. 

This is a hard proposition to test, however, since a tiny change in the reed position can have large effects on response, and it is next to impossible to put the reed on in exactly the same position when changing ligs. Also, since it is very easy to change response with the embouchure, even when
 trying very hard to maintain it constant, there is a tendency to find the response one expects or hopes to find.

Perhaps someone should do a series of experiments using an artificial embouchure. Repeated trials should take care of small variations in placement (and a control test could be run to see just the range of variation from one re-placement of the reed to the next using a single lig). The artificial
 embouchure would take care of player variability. 

Until such a test is run there is really no way of saying what causes the reported differences from one lig to the next.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Dave,

If you look closely, you&#39;ll probably notice that the position of the lig changes the clearance between the tip of the reed and the tip rail. This is due to a number of possible factors. Often the table is not perfectly even and the reed can rock forward and back depending on the pressure point(s)
 of the lig. Also, the reed itself is often not perfectly flat, and the reed itself can compress somewhat. All these things can change the relationship of the reed to the tip--basically they can change the effective facing of the mpc and the tip opening.

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, I think that if one were to put a little block at the butt of the reed after the first ligature was installed, this would act as a stop to set the position of the reed for subsequent ligatures.  That being said, it would be difficult to stop skew, or, side-to-side positioning of the reed.  If the reed were only as wide as the table, I wonder if the minute skewing from eyeballing the side-to-side position would make that much difference.

            <pre class='message__body'>  Hello,
  I don&#39;t see how research in this area would benefit anything. It is so impirical, every mouthpiece aand ligature combination is different, without even considering the reed. I have never liked a Rovner on a metal Link and yet Rovners are great on other pieces. We should be grateful that there is so much choice in ligatures so that we can always find something that works.
   The reed comes into play as well. One of the first things Larry Combs showed me was how he experimented with  reed position, moving it around on the table and play-testing it until he found the sweet  spot. Then he would mark the reed with an arrow or two as a guide for the next time.    Peter

That being said, it would be difficult to stop skew, or, side-to-side positioning of the reed.  If the reed were only as wide as the table, I wonder if the minute skewing from eyeballing the side-to-side position would make that much difference.

I&#39;ve actually had people ask me if they should go with a gold plated ligature, rather than a silver one, in order to get a warmer, darker tone.  

My main concerns with ligatures are that they hold the reed securely, not slip, and be easy to put on.

If the reed were only as wide as the table, I wonder if the minute skewing from eyeballing the side-to-side position would make that much difference.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah,

Perceptive chops.

This difference that ligatures make on open mpc&#39;s is nothing short of amazing.  Rovenor&#39;s Eddie Daniels are what I use exclusively and I&#39;ve done some blind tests and everyone says the sound is better on the Daniels.

I think you guys down south need to come up here to Michigan and here some REAL sax men play.  We got George Benson (Motown), Diego Rivera(MSU),  Chris Collins.  Those guys you got demoing can&#39;t hold a candle to the chops we got up here.  You need to spend sometime in Ann Arbor, MI and find out what real sax guys can play.

You&#39;re a good marketing guy, I&#39;m not impressed with your sound.

  Hello,
  I don't see how research in this area would benefit anything. It is so impirical, every mouthpiece aand ligature combination is different, without even considering the reed. I have never liked a Rovner on a metal Link and yet Rovners are great on other pieces. We should be grateful that there is so much choice in ligatures so that we can always find something that works.
   The reed comes into play as well. One of the first things Larry Combs showed me was how he experimented with  reed position, moving it around on the table and play-testing it until he found the sweet  spot. Then he would mark the reed with an arrow or two as a guide for the next time.    Peter

If the reed were only as wide as the table, I wonder if the minute skewing from eyeballing the side-to-side position would make that much difference.

Hi Steve,

You say "why a ligature might make a difference once it accomplishes its job of holding the reed securely in its proper position."

The answer is this (IMHO):  Most ligatures don&#39;t actually do that.  I have modified every ligature I have owned so that it does, and once  they a) fit the mouthpiece properly and b) provide even, reasonably firm and adjustable pressure at the correct points on the reed, they all sound and feel the same to me.

Modifications I have done in the past, to good effect:

* Inverting ligatures (so that the screws don&#39;t pinch the reed)
* Adding padding or filling to the areas that touch the reed
* Creating rails or pressure points out of epoxy or dental acrylic (so that the lig is more like a Bonade inverted)

Actually, the best mod I have ever done is to put 2 or 3 layers of pad leather on a link screw lig - this creates a good surface to hold the reed with, without having to crank the sucker down and mashing the reed fibers.  I also bend the plates so they are symmetrical before putting the leather pad on.

BTW, I don&#39;t much like the Rovner ligs because I think that they don&#39;t actually hold the reed on firmly enough.  (The "lights" are better in this regard.)  I notice a lot of saliva leakage onto the table when I use these ligs.

            <pre class='message__body'>You are not the only one skeptical about all this. I have never found any formal study of ligs, but I have done a lot of informal investigation myself. My conclusion is that lig materials make no difference, IF the lig does not change the relationship of the reed to the table and lay, but that is a big if.

Some years ago I spent a fair amount of time in LA at Oleg&#39;s with him trying to "help" me feel the difference using his lig with different back/front screw tensions. I admit that I must be pretty dense, because it didn&#39;t really seem to make a big difference, but anyway I bought one (they are not cheap) to experiment with. 

After more testing I decided that there was a bit of a difference depending on how the front/back tension was set, but that that depended on the fact that when the front screw was tight the reed tip was closer to the tip rail and vice versa. This was easy to measure with calipers. The deal seems to be that a lig can make a very perceptible difference because tables are rarely flat and reeds do compress somewhat. So depending on where the lig tension is highest, it can shift the angle of the reed to the mpc. 

As to one or another lig allowing the reed to"vibrate freely" or some other such crap, there are a few things you should think about.

First, just how freely can a reed vibrate? The tip certainly vibrates, but by the break the reed hardly moves at all, and where the lig holds the reed the vibrations are miniscule. Some people think that a soft lig can allow some movement between the reed stock and the table. This seems like a fine idea at first, but think a bit deeper: if you hold a free reed onto the tip with one hand, and use the other hand to push the reed stock flush with the table, just how much pressure does it take? Not much at all. 

So actually the softest lig, tightened enough to hold the reed to the table without a lot of lateral shifting, is already exerting at least an order of magnitude more pressure than it takes to keep the reed stock from moving on the table in reaction to the vibration of the tip.

Another little test that I did was to play the sax one handed while holding the reed on the mpc with the other hand. That way I could continuously vary the pressure holding the reed on while playing. Did I feel any difference in response between clamping the reed as hard as I could and holding it so loosely that it was almost ready to fall off? Not a bit, until the pressure was so small that the stock actually did begin to vibrate on the table, and that positively did NOT help the sound.

I have tried velcro, string, rubber bands, soft fabric ligs, plastic ligs, Olegatures, hard ligs with two screws, one screw, Harrisons, etc. I think ligs are the biggest scam out there. 

I know that many disagree with me, and seem to find great differences between different ligs. I would really love to do some blind tests with ligs and see if people could actually tell the difference if they didn&#39;t know what lig they were playing. This is a test that would be quite easy to do, as the only thing that would need to be done is change the lig randomly a number of times, cover it up so that it could not be visually identified, and let people try to guess which is what, say, 25 times. I have a strong suspicion that like Coltman with flutes, people would be surprised to find out that they suddenly couldn&#39;t tell any difference.

Another thing that people who really do find a difference between different ligs can try is to use vernier calipers to check the tip clearance with the ligs they are comparing. In my case, it was pretty clear that the different ligs were clamping the reed at different points on the table, or compressing the cane at different points on the table, changing the reed clearance (and thus changing the feel).

John, if you are reading this, there is another test for your artificial embouchure.

  At the recent NAMM show, I had my ears filled by Jody Espina, Theo Wanne, Oleg Garbozov, and others about the relative merits of various ligature designs, and the effects of alternative plates and materials. Honestly, I&#39;m a little skeptical about this. I&#39;ve tried various brands over the years, but am not totally convinced I can tell a difference or that I can find a scientific basis for understanding why a ligature might make a difference once it accomplishes its job of holding the reed securely in its proper position. Other than anecdotal stories, does anyone know of any real study of this topic?

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree with you for the most part, although I DO hear some tiny differences between radical extremes such as metal vs. fabric.  I still can't figure out how people can hear a difference between gold-plated vs. silver-plated Harrison ligs, though, and many claim they can.  I can only assume the lig or reed must move slightly between trials.

You are not the only one skeptical about all this. I have never found any formal study of ligs, but I have done a lot of informal investigation myself. My conclusion is that lig materials make no difference, IF the lig does not change the relationship of the reed to the table and lay, but that is a big if.

Some years ago I spent a fair amount of time in LA at Oleg's with him trying to "help" me feel the difference using his lig with different back/front screw tensions. I admit that I must be pretty dense, because it didn't really seem to make a big difference, but anyway I bought one (they are not cheap) to experiment with. 

After more testing I decided that there was a bit of a difference depending on how the front/back tension was set, but that that depended on the fact that when the front screw was tight the reed tip was closer to the tip rail and vice versa. This was easy to measure with calipers. The deal seems to be that a lig can make a very perceptible difference because tables are rarely flat and reeds do compress somewhat. So depending on where the lig tension is highest, it can shift the angle of the reed to the mpc. 

As to one or another lig allowing the reed to"vibrate freely" or some other such crap, there are a few things you should think about.

First, just how freely can a reed vibrate? The tip certainly vibrates, but by the break the reed hardly moves at all, and where the lig holds the reed the vibrations are miniscule.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree with all of this, but here is something that happened to me some years ago.

I was playing with the Vandoren Optimum ligature for a couple of years. I felt a lot of resistance, like when you are out of practice or you have a bad (but not too hard) reed. I never considered the problem was the ligature, so I tried many reeds, practiced, etc. etc. and nothing really helped. After a couple of months of this I had a rehearsal with another player and for no reason at all we tried each other&#39;s ligatures. From the first note I played with his ligature, the problem was gone. I couldn&#39;t believe it at first, but it wasn&#39;t just me, several other people in the room imedaitely heard how much better it sounded. His ligature happened to be the Oleg.

I found the Oleg lig on ebay for $20 and ordered it. I also tried a bunch of other ligatures I had but haven&#39;t used ever since I got the Optimum. None had the problem of the Optimum! I had no problem when I first tried the Optimum so I guess something happened, but whatever it was, it affected response so much. I still use the Oleg but I can use most others I have and it is ok, except that Optimum which still has the response problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>The not-so-flat table and flex in a cloth/synthetic ligature can explain why a Rover type ligature can make many more reeds in a box work better for some people. But it would make poor marketing to be truthful and say "Our ligature can help more reeds work on your warped, piece of junk mouthpiece"

At a music convention 20+ years ago, a store had a box full of assorted size, tarnished, inverted ligatures shaped like a funky X on the reed side, minus the screws. They were selling for not much each. I picked one up for a sturdy spare. Later I wished I would have got the whole box of Harrisons for me and Ebay sales!!!!

I like your blind test ideas but I do not think this a good fit for John&#39;s apparatus as it is currently designed.  His embouchure clamp is mounted off (connected to) the ligature.
 
I think most players are reporting their experiences truthfully.  Sometimes a ligature design, position, tension matters a lot, sometimes it does not.  I think the reason it may matter a lot is if the table is not flat.  The table may be concave, convex or wavy in many different ways.  The various contact points of the ligatures will play off these points.  Cane reeds swell a little, synths do not.  Cane and some synths get softer after 20 minutes of play.  
 
Years ago I spent many hours testing different contact point arrangements with Winslow ligatures.  The process of removing and re-installing the snap rings for each post is tedious.  Out of 8-10 arrangements, I would find 2 that were bad, 2 that were good (responsive was my criterion) and rest were like any plain ligature design to me.  On a tapered mouthpiece, like the Runyon Custom Alto that I use, the Winslow can be a pain to seat.  It wants to slide off while tightening.  I find a Rovner L-6 much easier to put on and almost as good.  I give my Winslow a 10 and the Rovner a 9.5.  But if the Winslow is not centered just right, the Rovner plays better.  So in a blind test, the Rovner may win (or I could not tell the diff).
 
On Meyer-like alto mouthpieces, I find the Optimum a great design.  One screw, nice an secure, floating plate(s).  But again, the Rovner Lights are a great low-cost go-to ligature that I keep in all sizes for mouthpiece play-testing.  I was not that impressed with Oleg ligatures.  They are a fuss to get on for me and I did not get a sonic "wow" from them.  But for those that do, great!.
 
I&#39;m sure there is a lot of pre-conceived opinions about ligatures.  We like shiny things.  The mesh of the Oleg looks classy to many.  The piston look of the Winslow looks tech-y and appeals to some for that reason.  The Optimum has a little of each IMO.  Most Rovners are not pretty.  But a few are and most of them do not mark up your mouthpiece.  
 
Ligatures are fairly low cost.  I do not think you can create a test that the results will apply to all sax players and their set-ups.  But you can test what they think they know with their eyes open vs with them closed.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,   I think Olegs, despite their beautiful appearance, have a design flaw. The screws are much too high up and tend to bend  upwards after prolonged use, so that the two bars no longer pull at right angles on the mesh and you end up with poor sealage of the reed.   I read an article recently in The Clarinet about tying your mouthpiece with string as in the old days. I tried it and it worked great. Then I sewed the string coils together so that I no longer have to tie it each time.  It is a permanent wrap around string ligature.  It works so well that I am going to try it on  my tenor mouthpiece, perhaps incorporating a small metal bar in the string to make it like an Eddie Daniels Rovner.   With the right string, this could also be a rather esthetically pleasing ligature too. Peter

I&#39;m sure there is a lot of pre-conceived opinions about ligatures.  We
like shiny things.  The mesh of the Oleg looks classy to many. &lt;&lt;   I
use an Oleg ligature. I really don&#39;t like its too-fancy look. At least I
have the silver colour one and not the even-more-fancy-looking gold one.
Still looks too fancy to me and I don&#39;t like it when it draws attention
from others who ask me about it. But I like it enough to use it in spite
of all that. I don&#39;t have a problem putting it on because I have a
mouthpiece patch on the back of the mouthpiece so the lig doesn&#39;t slip.
I also keep the reed on the mouthpiece a lot of the time for other
reasons anyway.

Toby, since I tend to agree with you, maybe you have an explanation or a
guess to what can cause the problem I had with the Optimum ligature I
described above? It wasn&#39;t a small problem, but a very obvious problem
in response.

By the way, AFAIK most clarinet mouthpiece in Europe have a regular
design similar the mouthpiece in other places. Most players in Europe
use thos emouthpieces. Only some players, mainly in Germany, Austria and
some other countries use the mouthpiece with grooves for the string.
Even in those countries not all players use them.

This would signify that if we are dealing with a flat table upon which
different ligs do not position the reed differently vis-a-vis the tip
the lig would make no difference to the response of the reed.

Regarding Rovners, I agree about the cheap part.  Well made is another story.  I find the material they are made of too stiff to work properly in holding the reed to the mouthpiece well.  You can easily move the reed even though the lig is tight.  An exception is the "light" model where the center of the lig is relieved.

Maybe it&#39;s because of the mouthpiece shape.  If a one-screw ligature doesn&#39;t exactly match the profile of the mouthpiece body, then one or the other end of the lig will be holding tighter, and the optimum pressure is not put on the reed.  As I mentioned before, I often find a wet area on the table after playing with a Rovner lig.  

Maybe putting a little extra flexible pad inside would help.  Like a couple sections of wide rubber band, with some pad leather on top.  I&#39;ll try that this weekend and let folks know.

            <pre class='message__body'>I really don&#39;t have an explanation for your experience with the Optimum. One thing to check is the tip clearance with the Optimum and then with another lig that you like. Use a vernier caliper and just measure the tip opening with both and see if they are the same.

 Toby, since I tend to agree with you, maybe you have an explanation or a
 guess to what can cause the problem I had with the Optimum ligature I
 described above? It wasn&#39;t a small problem, but a very obvious problem
 in response.
 
 By the way, AFAIK most clarinet mouthpiece in Europe have a regular
 design similar the mouthpiece in other places. Most players in Europe
 use thos emouthpieces. Only some players, mainly in Germany, Austria and
 some other countries use the mouthpiece with grooves for the string.
 Even in those countries not all players use them.

 This would signify that if we are dealing with a flat table upon which
 different ligs do not position the reed differently vis-a-vis the tip
 the lig would make no difference to the response of the reed.

 time. I personally have found the differences between these methods of
 reed clamping miniscule at best, but some people swear by one method or
 another.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had the same sticking problem with my older style rovner.  I cut off the part of the material that wrapped around onto the inside of the ligature and that solved the problem.  I never really cared much for rovners so i took a new style link ligature (which are garbage) and cut off the plate that contacts the reed.  I glued that plate to the inside of the rovner lig where it would make contact with the reed and its essentially like an eddie daniels rovner.  It actually works very well.

I used inside caliper measurements of each end of my bari neck to get their inside diametrers.  I used a drafting rubber flexible ruler to get the centerline length.
 
I did not mean to imply there was an issue here.  I think bari neck tapers might vary a lot.

How did you take your measurements?  I removed the tenon on both necks and measured the inside of the neck tube, and the length along the center line.

            <pre class='message__body'>One rainy day I decided to take bore measurements of my sax collection; sop, alto and tenor.  In each case, I found that the neck had a significantly different taper from the body.  Also, none of necks were a true cone.  On the two tenors I measured the neck was slightly convex.  On two altos the neck taper was concave.  On my Yanagisawa sop neck there is a cylindrical insert at the mouthpiece end.  The bore of all saxes was cylindrical over the length neck tenon.  However, the main body tube was close to a true cone on each horn (except for the flair at the bell).

So how is the missing cone supposed to be measured to arrive at the ideal mp volume?  Is the average cone over the whole bore, or just the neck?  It seems to me that you get a different result depending on where you measure from . . .

I have my measurements as Excel spreadsheets with graphs, if anyone is interested . . .

            <pre class='message__body'>There are different views, depending on who&#39;s definition of "the substitution for the missing cone" you adhere to.  Benade says mouthpiece + neck.  Dr. J Wolfe, says mouthpiece + reed compliance.  Ferron says mouthpiece.  I&#39;m inclined to go with Dr. Wolfe.   As the mouthpiece/reed compliance is supposed to fool the main body into believing that it is complete, and the neck has an altered taper to compensate for the flattening effect of the reed, etc., then the mouthpiece/reed compliance must compensate for the volume of the missing cone, based upon the main body taper, from the beginning of the new neck taper, minus the volume of the neck itself.  Nederveen discusses this in later chapters of his book.  

As I mentioned earlier, my measurements were only conservative approximations, since I only measured the necks.

So how is the missing cone supposed to be measured to arrive at the ideal mp volume?  Is the average cone over the whole bore, or just the neck?  It seems to me that you get a different result depending on where you measure from . . .

I have my measurements as Excel spreadsheets with graphs, if anyone is interested . . .

            <pre class='message__body'>Benade&#39;s discussion centers mainly around the natural resonant frequency
produced by the the saxophone mouthpiece plus neck which he calls
Frs----the frequency of the reed on its staple (oboe), the reed on its
bocal (bassoon), mouthpiece on its neck (saxophone).   Whether the
"missing cone" is treated as the extension of the cone truncated at the
neck or at the tenon receiver in the body should make no difference  in
the acoustic principle inolved.

An interesting exercise would be to measure the physical volume of the
mouthpiece plus neck and compare that to the mathematically computed
volume of the missing cone from the end of the body, and then do the
same with the portion of the mouthpiece that extends beyond the neck.

In an earlier study,  I found that the Frs  of the alto saxophone
mouthpiece and neck to be close to Ab concert (as taught by Rousseau). 
It would be an easy step to measure the physical volume of the
mouthpiece, subtract the portion that goes on the neck, and compare that
volume with the computed volume of the "missing cone".  The difference
should effectively show the volume added by the vibration of the reed
and the player&#39;s oral cavity to the geometric volume of the mouthpiece
to create the effective volume.  I will run these numbers and get back
to the discussion.

I would be interested if you could give a more specific reference to the
source of this information from Nederveen---a chapter or a page number
would be most helpful.

Ferron says mouthpiece.  I&#39;m inclined to go with Dr. Wolfe.   As the
mouthpiece/reed compliance is supposed to fool the main body into
believing that it is complete, and the neck has an altered taper to
compensate for the flattening effect of the reed, etc., then the
mouthpiece/reed compliance must compensate for the volume of the missing
cone, based upon the main body taper, from the beginning of the new neck
taper, minus the volume of the neck itself.  Nederveen discusses this in

What if the neck taper is not right?  In Benade&#39;s case, he uses the body taper as the cone.  So if the neck tapers too much, the mouthpiece volume would need to be larger to compensate.  If the others are just using the neck as the cone, then if it tapers too much you will calculate a small missing cone volume on the end. 

I think both can only give a similar MP volume answer if the neck taper is the same as the body taper (?).

Low Bb Baris have much longer necks than Low A baris.  They are apples and oranges.  It has nothing to do with the YBS52 being an "intermediate" instrument.  The 52 is very similar in dimensions to any modern Low A bari including the Yanis and Selmers (including Low A mark VIs).

            <pre class='message__body'>Having a stripped down Mark VI alto body and neck made it easy to crunch
some numbers.

The volume of the missing cone from the end of the saxophone using the
1.51 body taper is 68.63 cc
The measured volume of the neck is 48.2  cc (using Ferron&#39;s formula
48.5)  The difference (volume of missing cone) is 20.43 cc

The volume of the missing cone using the dimensions and the 1.61 slope
of the neck is only 8.04 cc ----61% less.

The computed volume of the neck plus the missing cone minus the measured
volume of the neck is 8.34 cc

This of course begs the question of which taper determines the missing
cone length and volume that satisfies the truncated cone&#39;s acoustic
requirements.  My thinking is that the Frs  of the mouthpiece plus the
neck answers at least part of this question.  That resonant frequency is
easily determined  by the formula Frs = v/2xo  where v is the speed of
sound and xo  is the length of the cone segment.  My reasoning is that
the length of the missing cone is a part of the formula that determines
its volume along with the radius of the open end.

In other words the Frs  of the saxophone mouthpiece (missing cone) on
its neck is determined by the slope, therefore length, therefore volume
of the neck and not the different slope of the saxophone body.

John,

I have to disagree with you on this.  Nederveen discusses the use of successive cones in conical woodwinds, in order to improve mode purity - help the higher resonances remain harmonic at high frequencies.  It is clearly illustrated.  With the incorporation of a narrower taper at the upper end of the tube (equivalent to a saxophone neck), the volume of the missing cone is determined by the main body taper, from the point of the onset of the narrower taper (neck tenon - alto and tenor).  The volume of the mouthpiece, reed compliance, and neck, must then equal this missing cone volume.  

To fulfill the higher mode requirements then, the substitution must have the same playing frequency as that of the theoretical missing cone - the exact same theoretical cone used for the volume measurement, based upon the main body taper, measured from the onset of the narrower taper, to the theoretical apex, and according to Benade&#39;s formula. This is why Benade insisted upon "the mouthpiece on it&#39;s neck".  

The Frs of the mouthpiece on the neck is not purely determined by the mechanical length of the section (taper of the neck), as it is not a pure cone nor a pure cylinder.  Volume distribution at the mouthpiece compression anti-node and the diameter of the neck&#39;s displacement anti-node dramatically affect the playing frequency.  Benade&#39;s formula applies only to the theoretical cone, not the mouthpiece + neck.

Remember, it&#39;s about a truncated body, not a truncated neck.

            <pre class='message__body'>It seems to me that the neck taper is instrumental (pardon the pun) in determining the intonation of the shorter-tube notes, in which that taper plays a larger role, and is less important for the long-tube notes. We need to keep in mind that there has been all kinds of tweaking of the sax cone over the decades in response to all the factors that go into compromising harmonics in a real-world instrument. I&#39;m guessing that the neck is a more accurate representation of the realistic cone angle of the instrument, due to all the extra compliance of the toneholes.

  Having a stripped down Mark VI alto body and neck made it easy to crunch some numbers.

  The volume of the missing cone from the end of the saxophone using the 1.51 body taper is 68.63 cc
  The measured volume of the neck is 48.2  cc (using Ferron&#39;s formula 48.5)  The difference (volume of missing cone) is 20.43 cc

  The volume of the missing cone using the dimensions and the 1.61 slope of the neck is only 8.04 cc ----61% less.

  The computed volume of the neck plus the missing cone minus the measured volume of the neck is 8.34 cc

  This of course begs the question of which taper determines the missing cone length and volume that satisfies the truncated cone&#39;s acoustic requirements.  My thinking is that the Frs  of the mouthpiece plus the neck answers at least part of this question.  That resonant frequency is easily determined  by the formula Frs = v/2xo  where v is the speed of sound and xo  is the length of the cone segment.  My reasoning is that the length of the missing cone is a part of the formula that determines its volume along with the radius of the open end.

  In other words the Frs  of the saxophone mouthpiece (missing cone) on its neck is determined by the slope, therefore length, therefore volume of the neck and not the different slope of the saxophone body.

            <pre class='message__body'>When Benade talks about Frs being the resonant frequency of the substitution plus constriction, he is using the shortcut of mpc + neck as a conveneint demarcation, but actually, it is the substitution plus ANY portion of the cone after the truncation, the limit being the mpc plus an infinitely short section of cone the diameter of the truncated end. The longer the portion of cone, the less effect the actual volume of the the mpc has on the Frs.

Therefore, it would be best to simply cut off the mpc at the point of the neck insertion and make the diameter there that of the end of the neck. This, however is not ideal for the mpc...so the next easiest step is to remove the neck and calculate the Frs of the neck + mpc, which should then equal that of a complete cone of that length and angle. In the real world, this is good enough for jazz...

  Benade&#39;s discussion centers mainly around the natural resonant frequency produced by the the saxophone mouthpiece plus neck which he calls Frs----the frequency of the reed on its staple (oboe), the reed on its bocal (bassoon), mouthpiece on its neck (saxophone).   Whether the "missing cone" is treated as the extension of the cone truncated at the neck or at the tenon receiver in the body should make no difference  in the acoustic principle inolved.

  An interesting exercise would be to measure the physical volume of the mouthpiece plus neck and compare that to the mathematically computed volume of the missing cone from the end of the body, and then do the same with the portion of the mouthpiece that extends beyond the neck.

  In an earlier study,  I found that the Frs  of the alto saxophone mouthpiece and neck to be close to Ab concert (as taught by Rousseau).  It would be an easy step to measure the physical volume of the mouthpiece, subtract the portion that goes on the neck, and compare that volume with the computed volume of the "missing cone".  The difference should effectively show the volume added by the vibration of the reed and the player&#39;s oral cavity to the geometric volume of the mouthpiece to create the effective volume.  I will run these numbers and get back to the discussion.

  I would be interested if you could give a more specific reference to the source of this information from Nederveen---a chapter or a page number would be most helpful.

Dr. J Wolfe, says mouthpiece + reed compliance. Ferron says mouthpiece. I&#39;m inclined to go with Dr. Wolfe. As the mouthpiece/reed compliance is supposed to fool the main body into believing that it is complete, and the neck has an altered taper to compensate for the flattening effect of the reed, etc., then the mouthpiece/reed compliance must compensate for the volume of the missing cone, based upon the main body taper, from the beginning of the new neck taper, minus the volume of the neck itself. Nederveen discusses this in later chapters of his book.

Also, none of necks were a true cone. On the two tenors I measured the neck was slightly convex. On two altos the neck taper was concave. On my Yanagisawa sop neck there is a cylindrical insert at the mouthpiece end. The bore of all saxes was cylindrical over the length neck tenon. However, the main body tube was close to a true cone on each horn (except for the flair at the bell).

Low Bb Baris have much longer necks than Low A baris.  They are apples and oranges.  It has nothing to do with the YBS52 being an "intermediate" instrument.  The 52 is very similar in dimensions to any modern Low A bari including the Yanis and Selmers (including Low A mark VIs).

I think the difference is not the low A but the modern design.  The low A Martin has a long neck with octave key, as does the Conn 13M, I think.  Modern designs have the key below the neck, mostly to make regulation more consistent, I&#39;d guess.

Low Bb Baris have much longer necks than Low A baris.  They are apples and oranges.  It has nothing to do with the YBS52 being an "intermediate" instrument.  The 52 is very similar in dimensions to any modern Low A bari including the Yanis and Selmers (including Low A mark VIs).

The reason I asked is, the standard 6" caliper like most people use, doesn&#39;t have internal feelers long enough to reach all the way inside the tenon to the neck tube. Measuring the inside of the tenon is meaningless.

I don&#39;t think there was that much dramatic tweaking done since Benade and Nederveen published their papers.  They had it pretty much figured out, tone holes and all.  I&#39;m gonna have to go with the published experts on this.

I reckon the bore sizes are accurate to about + or - 0.1mm and the bore lengths accurate to + or - 1mm.  Bore length of 0mm is at cork end of neck.

I must disagree Toby. Everything above C# 3, is meant to be played as an overblown 2nd mode exclusively, and each note has it&#39;s own unique tone hole.  Size and tone hole placement alone are responsible for the initial tuning of the short-tube notes.  As mentioned, the narrower neck taper helps
 higher resonances remain close to a harmonic integral relationship, so that the overblown middle register notes - D2 to C#3 are in tune with their lower octave relatives

Toby--Certainly it is true that the palm notes have their own holes and thus don&#39;t need to worry about taper, but I meant that if you have, say, two different tapers, you would need a composite volume based on the amount of each taper involved in the active air colum.

 So just to simply to the point of absurdity, let&#39;s say that you have an air column in which the top half has a taper of 2 degrees and the bottom half a taper of 1 degree. You would need to figure the substitution volume for a note using the whole length for a cone with a 1.5 degree taper. But if
 you were playing a note using 3/4 of the air column, it would be a composite cone of 1.75 degrees, and for a note half the length of the air column (since in that case only the top half of the cone is involved) you need to figure on a cone of 2 degrees.

 Of course all the waters are muddied by the facts of a real air column--that the modes are all lowered by the reed, that the compliance is increased due to the volume under the closed toneholes, etc. Nor am I at all certain that a simple average of the lengths and their tapers is anywhere near
 accurate, but obviously you need to take different tapers into account in figuring the substitution volume, it seems to me.
  
Benade and Nederveen were both very clear in text and illustration, in multiple instances: "For a conical woodwind instrument to work properly, the equivalent volume of the reed cavity added to the mechanical volume of it&#39;s staple (or bocal, or neck) must closely match the volume of the missing
 part of the cone."  That would mean the main body cone, not the neck cone.  

Toby--Again, the definition of the constriction is not set in stone. A bari neck is a far different proportion of the total tube than the tenor neck, and some sops have no neck at all. "Neck" is just a convenient demarcation of the constriction plus some part of the cone. And a change in angle
 near the top of the cone will certainly affect the short-tube notes more than the longer-tube notes. As an analog, take the "parabolic" head of the Boehm flute. It sharpens the notes progressively as you go up the tube, to compensate for the increasing end correction as the flute player moves his
 lips to cover more of the hole in adjusting the jet length (which flattens the notes progressively as you ascend the tube). Don&#39;t forget also that the tuning of the modes is affected not only by the substitution volume, but by the truncation ratio--which changes each time a tonehole is covered or
 uncovered. The larger the truncation ratio the more the modes are affected by whatever is used as the substitution.

--What I meant was that the sax cone is far from the ideal straight cone so beloved of simple theory. I may well be wrong about the neck being the more accurate representation of real-world cone angle (for the purpose of figuring the volume of the mpc), but there can be no doubt that spherical
 waves change their behavior at any point where there is an effective change of cone angle, whether at the "necking in" point under the cork, the neck, the tenon, in the main tube under toneholes, the bow or in the bell. Each of these factors changes mode relationships and will have some effect on
 the "ideal" mpc volume.

  "In other words the Frs  of the saxophone mouthpiece (missing cone) on its neck is determined by the slope, therefore length, therefore volume of the neck and not the different slope of the saxophone body."

  John,

  I have to disagree with you on this.  Nederveen discusses the use of successive cones in conical woodwinds, in order to improve mode purity - help the higher resonances remain harmonic at high frequencies.  It is clearly illustrated.  With the incorporation of a narrower taper at the upper end of the tube (equivalent to a saxophone neck), the volume of the missing cone is determined by the main body taper, from the point of the onset of the narrower taper (neck tenon - alto and tenor).  The volume of the mouthpiece, reed compliance, and neck, must then equal this missing cone volume.  

  To fulfill the higher mode requirements then, the substitution must have the same playing frequency as that of the theoretical missing cone - the exact same theoretical cone used for the volume measurement, based upon the main body taper, measured from the onset of the narrower taper, to the theoretical apex, and according to Benade&#39;s formula. This is why Benade insisted upon "the mouthpiece on it&#39;s neck".  

  The Frs of the mouthpiece on the neck is not purely determined by the mechanical length of the section (taper of the neck), as it is not a pure cone nor a pure cylinder.  Volume distribution at the mouthpiece compression anti-node and the diameter of the neck&#39;s displacement anti-node dramatically affect the playing frequency.  Benade&#39;s formula applies only to the theoretical cone, not the mouthpiece + neck.

  Remember, it&#39;s about a truncated body, not a truncated neck. 


  Yes, agreed, but you also need to remember that the truncated neck is part of the truncated body: there is no clear division here, and the more toneholes you open the less the influence of the body cone as compared to the neck cone.

  Also, I question how much the volume under the reed tip affects the Hh resonance of the mpc. In one conversation with Joe Wolfe, in which I was discussing changing the distribution of the volume in the mpc (by adding the same amount of clay at various points in the chamber/baffle) he said only that close to the reed there might be Bernoulli effects. The Hh resonance is about a closed mass of air with a single aperture. The ratio of air mass to aperture diameter determines the resonant frequency. In this equation, there is no compression antinode.

            <pre class='message__body'>Flare and taper are two different things. A cone tapers but does not flare. A horn flares, and this is why it is unusable a a musical bore shape. A change of cone angle is effectively like a flare in a cone, which changes mode relationships. Surely you are not suggesting that a conical woodwind is
 cylindrical ?

The length of the "missing cone" from an alto sax neck as calculated from the taper of the neck when added to the length of the neck itself is very close to 1/2 the wavelength of Ab concert which is the note produced when the mouthpiece and neck are played with a normal embouchure.

If the missing cone were calculated from the different taper of the body and then added as an extension beyond the neck, it would be significantly longer and hence produce a considerably lower pitch.

If the bore taper is the same, and the neck opening is the same, the length of the neck doesn't matter.  It just means they put the tenon in a different place.  The air columns are the same, except for the bell section.

I think the difference is not the low A but the modern design.  The low A Martin has a long neck with octave key, as does the Conn 13M, I think.  Modern designs have the key below the neck, mostly to make regulation more consistent, I'd guess.

Low Bb Baris have much longer necks than Low A baris.  They are apples and oranges.  It has nothing to do with the YBS52 being an "intermediate" instrument.  The 52 is very similar in dimensions to any modern Low A bari including the Yanis and Selmers (including Low A mark VIs).

The reason I asked is, the standard 6" caliper like most people use, doesn't have internal feelers long enough to reach all the way inside the tenon to the neck tube. Measuring the inside of the tenon is meaningless.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ahh a play test.  Now we are (maybe) getting somewhere.   But the volume of the mouthpiece on the alto neck you tested is really not the missing cone of the sax body cone.  It is the present cone of the mouthpiece and neck.  You verified that this sub-system calculates and plays at Ab.  Is the volume of this sub-system equal to or smaller than the missing body cone volume?

Andrew&#39;s Yana sop bore OD mesurements indicate that the neck is tapered steeper than the body.  Otheres have reported similar observations and some reported that the taper does not change.  But Andrew presented some data.  I think the ID profile will be similar.  So unless the mouthpiece volume is larger than the missing cone from the neck taper, it will not be equal to the missing cone volume from the body taper.  

What may be needed is some more play testing of mouthpieces tuned on saxes and measurements of their chamber volumes.  Which calculation method will match the data?

degree of conicity of the tube which determines the relationships of

How does this apply to a saxophone reed chamber/neck combination, which is neither a perfect, straight sided cone nor a cylinder?

"The length of the "missing cone" from an alto sax neck as calculated
from the taper of the neck when added to the length of the neck itself
is very close to 1/2 the wavelength of Ab concert which is the note
produced when the mouthpiece and neck are played with a normal
embouchure."

If this were true, and every type of alto mouthpiece on every brand of alto neck produced an Ab concert, when played by any player, using a normal embouchure, and if getting "close" qualified as "meticulously matching the mouthpiece to the horn", then we would certainly be wasting our time bothering to measure things.

"If the missing cone were calculated from the different taper of the
body and then added as an extension beyond the neck, it would be
significantly longer and hence produce a considerably lower pitch."

Did you actually measure the alto body taper?  My The Martin tenor shows no appreciable difference between the neck and the body taper.  Looking at Nederveen&#39;s charts of various saxophone bores, it is more than obvious, from the very, very, very long straight lines of the main body tubes (don&#39;t say tone holes), and the very short, irregular lines of the neck sections, that by far (ridiculously even), the main component of the instrument is the body and the neck, by comparison, is nothing more than a small tweak, slightly more tapered in it&#39;s very short upper half, and having a gross cylindrical tenon error in it&#39;s lower part.  I don&#39;t even need Benade&#39;s or Nederveen&#39;s explanations to see which taper I am going to use to determine the missing cone and Frs.  It&#39;s silly.

I&#39;m certain that the vast majority of existing sax players needn&#39;t concern themselves in the least with matching mouthpiece chamber volumes in that they will be more than satisfied and challenged by the selection of stock modern saxophones and mouthpieces available, off the shelf.  Of the small minority who care about it, I&#39;m sure most of them will be satisfied measuring from the neck taper.  A small portion of that remainder however, are like me, focusing on the individual, acoustically superior horn, neck, mouthpiece, and player combination, where meticulously fitting the components to one another, really results in noticeable improvements.  The proof lies here. IMO.

Ahh a play test.  Now we are (maybe) getting somewhere.   But the volume of
the mouthpiece on the alto neck you tested is really not the missing cone of
the sax body cone.  It is the present cone of the mouthpiece and neck.  You
verified that this sub-system calculates and plays at Ab.  Is the volume of
this sub-system equal to or smaller than the missing body cone volume?


Andrew&#39;s Yana sop bore OD mesurements indicate that the neck is tapered
steeper than the body.  Otheres have reported similar observations and some
reported that the taper does not change.  But Andrew presented some data.  I
think the ID profile will be similar.  So unless the mouthpiece volume is
larger than the missing cone from the neck taper, it will not be equal to
the missing cone volume from the body taper.  

 

What may be needed is some more play testing of mouthpieces tuned on saxes
and measurements of their chamber volumes.  Which calculation method will
match the data?

It is important to differentiate between the physical length of the tube
which determines the wavelength-- -hence the frequency AND the degree of
conicity of the tube which determines the relationships of the octave and
the remaining higher partials.

The length of the "missing cone" from an alto sax neck as calculated from
the taper of the neck when added to the length of the neck itself is very
close to 1/2 the wavelength of Ab concert which is the note produced when
the mouthpiece and neck are played with a normal embouchure.

If the missing cone were calculated from the different taper of the body and
then added as an extension beyond the neck, it would be significantly longer
and hence produce a considerably lower pitch.

The proof is in the playing as I see it.

Have newer horns done away with the B-gargle, then?

I should think that measuring the physical (not to mention the
"effective", ie acoustical behavior of the) taper at the bow is a bit of a
challenge, even if one wanted to look at a bunch of new horns to see
what&#39;s being done. Not just the difference of the beginning and ending
diameters (easy enough), but what transpires along the curve.

Yes, there are.  Examine a Mk VI soprano (OK, not a great soprano, but a one piece soprano) and there is a quite evident "step" in the neck area.  Some call that a "venturi", but it is a change in conical section at that point.

Others I have seen have the same.

There is not a corresponding step where the bow of a larger sax would be, down by low Eb, C, etc.  But rather those tone holes are located to play those notes in tune.  Remember, those low notes do not have to play the octave in tune, only the fundamental.

I had talked to Dave Schottle some years back.  He was the designer of the L A Sax straight alto and straight tenor.  As you know, on the top end the necks are the same as the regular alto and tenor models, as are the main body tubes.

Where these differ is where the bow and bell sections would have been.  Dave told me he thought it would be a simple matter of making a straight section to substitute for the bow, then turn the bell section upside down and ... well, it didn&#39;t work out that way at all.  He had to relocated all of those low tone holes.  I don&#39;t remember what he said about taper on what would have been the bow.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Barry,

I made some measurements and graphs of various sax bore profiles, which can be seen the Files area under Misc and Other.  I found that of the two alto&#39;s  measured, the conical taper continues unchanged through the bow area.  It then starts to flare into the bell around about the low Bb key.

For the two tenors I measured, there is a slight change in taper in the bow; the cone angle reduces slightly.

For the straight soprano, the cone continues unchanged through the low B area.

Another interesting point is that the transition between the body cone and the neck taper does not necessarily begin at the neck tenon.  You can see that it begins after the tenon, ie within the body tube on the soprano and tenor.

Maybe not that relevant to a mouthpiece site, but hopefully interesting anyway.

Regards,
Andrew

            <pre class='message__body'>The neck has a physical length.  The mouthpiece properly proportioned
and properly placed on the cork becomes a "stand in" for the missing
cone and hence takes on its length and volume as seen by the rest of the
saxophone.  The physical length of the neck plus its missing cone has a
natural resonant frequency found by this formula:

F = V/2Xo

where V is the velocity of sound and Xo is the length of the neck plus
the calculated length of its missing cone.  When the player makes the
necessary adjustments to make the played frequency of the mouthpiece
plus neck combination match this natural resonant frequency of the
"ideal" missing cone, the acoustic requirement of the truncated cone of
the body is met and the saxophone plays its best.   The requirement that
the mouthpiece recreate the volume of the missing cone is closely
related to this Frs  since the volume of the missing cone and its length
(and therefore natural frequency) are proportional.

The carefully measured Mark VI neck taper  in my calculations was 1.8
degrees.  The Mark VI body tube taper was 1.51  They are hardly the
same.  For those who are interested, they can see the scale drawing at
this link:   Saxophone Taper

Looking at Nederveen&#39;s charts of various saxophone bores, it is more
than obvious, from the very, very, very long straight lines of the main
body tubes (don&#39;t say tone holes), and the very short, irregular lines
of the neck sections, that by far (ridiculously even), the main
component of the instrument is the body and the neck, by comparison, is
nothing more than a small tweak, slightly more tapered in it&#39;s very
short upper half, and having a gross cylindrical tenon error in it&#39;s
lower part.  I don&#39;t even need Benade&#39;s or Nederveen&#39;s explanations to
see which taper I am going to use to determine the missing cone and Frs.
It&#39;s silly.

The volume of the "sub system" as you call it is substantially smaller than the missing cone calculated from the taper of the body tube.  The natural resonant frequency of that larger and longer missing cone would be about a whole step lower to Gb concert.  Set your mouthpiece placement and/or embouchure to play Gb concert on your alto mouthpiece plus neck set-up and then do the same with the neck on the sax.  That should answer the question in a hurry.  :)

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know how John measured the neck, but it is worth mentioning that many saxes are "necked-in", which means that the very end of the neck is substantially narrowed as compared to the rest of the neck.

 points along the length of the neck. Measuring ID or OD of the two ends won&#39;t give an accurate figure in many cases.

The volume of the "sub system" as you call it is substantially smaller than the missing cone calculated from the taper of the body tube.  The natural resonant frequency of that larger and longer missing cone would be about a whole step lower to Gb concert.  Set your mouthpiece placement and/or embouchure to play Gb concert on your alto mouthpiece plus neck set-up and then do the same with the neck on the sax.  That should answer the question in a hurry.  :)

Do you mean the pitch when the mouthpiece and neck are played without the sax?  What is the taper in degrees of the Martin neck you are using, and what is the taper of the Martin body tube that you indicate is the same?  My Mark VI calculations were 1.8 degrees for the neck and 1.51 degrees for the body.

Knowing the taper of the neck should also allow the calculation of the length of the "missing cone" from the end of the neck.

The wavelength of Ab concert at speed of air 345 m/s(74 deg F) is 3320 mm.  Since the wavelength is equal to 2X the length of the tube  plus the end correction, the length of your missing cone plus the physical length of the neck added to .6 times the radius of the open end times 2 should be approximately 3320 mm.

The natural resonant frequency of that larger and longer missing cone would be about a whole step lower to Gb concert.  Set your mouthpiece placement and/or embouchure to play Gb concert on your alto mouthpiece plus neck set-up and then do the same with the neck on the sax.  That should answer the question in a hurry.  :)

It is the present cone of the mouthpiece and neck.  You verified that this sub-system calculates and plays at Ab.  Is the volume of this sub-system equal to or smaller than the missing body cone volume?

But Andrew presented some data.  I think the ID profile will be similar.  So unless the mouthpiece volume is larger than the missing cone from the neck taper, it will not be equal to the missing cone volume from the body taper.
