            <pre class='message__body'>TKS, Jim G,  Yes, they work much better, my first trial was with a #2 Rico 
Royal, seeming to require a lot  of air, and with a ?long? lay, it was quite 
different from my Bass cl [my now-major inst!] embouchure, on a fairly open 
Pomarico GG [refaced glass] mp using 1 1/2 or 2 tenor sax reeds, to which I have 
become accommodated and have adequate control.  I tried both an R R and a 
Symetricut, 1 1/2 [s], with back-polishing on fine paper, and yes easier, but will 
still trade for the 6* and hope for the best. I do appreciate your advice, as 
that is what I was seeking from you MP Work experts.  TKS to all.  Don
