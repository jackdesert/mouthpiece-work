This method isn&#39;t bad. You get a fair fit from the outset.

I&#39;ve also used sections of 2" diameter white polyvinyl plumbing pipe, which
is almost 1/4" thick. I shape it on a grinding wheel afterwards (NOT while
it&#39;s in the mouthpiece!) Or pieces of lucite. More labor intensive.

Depending the internal geography of the mouthpiece, such a baffle may stay
wedged in place by friction alone.

            <pre class='message__body'>First, the mouthpiece need to have straight sidewall for the baffle to wedge 
in/out of place.  If you make one for a mouthpiece with curved sidewall (like a 
Link), then you need to use a dab of poster-hanging putty to keep it in place.

I used to line the chamber with plastic wrap.  This works but leaves some 
wrinkles in the casted epoxy baffle.  If they are large, they can be filled in 
with JB Weld.

Now I coat the mouthpiece chamber with petroleum jelly.  I make the baffle using 
a quick-set plumbers&#39; epoxy putty (Oatey or similar).  I try to make it to size 
I need since it saves time.  Putting petroleum jelly on the top of the epoxy 
assists with shaping it and cleans off after the epoxy sets.  It is a bit 
slippery to shape it but with a few good shaping tools and some practice you can 
make some nice fitting baffles fairly quickly.

Most of my clients prefer a semi-permanent baffle of one that can come out.  
They know what sound they want for a particular mouthpiece.

Hi friends,
I tried to make a removable epoxy baffle for a Link and did not succeed.
Do you have an idea how to do it?
Thanks,

After it has completely hardened it should fit (unless you deformed it while removing it). You can then use something like contact cement to mount it (after
 cleaning the wax).
