            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve used a wad of plumbers epoxy, usually about twice as much as I think
the baffle will actually need, and used some polyethylene wrap to prevent
sticking. After it sets up, I pop it out and shape it.

This method isn&#39;t bad. You get a fair fit from the outset.

I&#39;ve also used sections of 2" diameter white polyvinyl plumbing pipe, which
is almost 1/4" thick. I shape it on a grinding wheel afterwards (NOT while
it&#39;s in the mouthpiece!) Or pieces of lucite. More labor intensive.

Depending the internal geography of the mouthpiece, such a baffle may stay
wedged in place by friction alone.

            <pre class='message__body'>I usually make removable baffles from sheet brass stock. If you&#39;re  
going to be taking them in and out, they need to be durable. Epoxy  
baffles don&#39;t stand up well to regular handling. Brass is very easy to  
shape, and ever so durable!

            <pre class='message__body'>First, the mouthpiece need to have straight sidewall for the baffle to wedge 
in/out of place.  If you make one for a mouthpiece with curved sidewall (like a 
Link), then you need to use a dab of poster-hanging putty to keep it in place.

I used to line the chamber with plastic wrap.  This works but leaves some 
wrinkles in the casted epoxy baffle.  If they are large, they can be filled in 
with JB Weld.

Now I coat the mouthpiece chamber with petroleum jelly.  I make the baffle using 
a quick-set plumbers&#39; epoxy putty (Oatey or similar).  I try to make it to size 
I need since it saves time.  Putting petroleum jelly on the top of the epoxy 
assists with shaping it and cleans off after the epoxy sets.  It is a bit 
slippery to shape it but with a few good shaping tools and some practice you can 
make some nice fitting baffles fairly quickly.

Most of my clients prefer a semi-permanent baffle of one that can come out.  
They know what sound they want for a particular mouthpiece.

Hi friends,
I tried to make a removable epoxy baffle for a Link and did not succeed.
Do you have an idea how to do it?
Thanks,
Sakshama

The dab was really helpful.

            <pre class='message__body'>What I would try is this: wax the inside of the mpc and form the baffle out of epoxy putty. Let it get semi-hard and carefully remove it. After it has completely hardened it should fit (unless you deformed it while removing it). You can then use something like contact cement to mount it (after
 cleaning the wax).

What a wonderful video.  I have read the posts online, but this video really makes the process of making a baffle super clear.  Thank you for taking the time to make the video and share your knowledge and skill.  Very much appreciated.
