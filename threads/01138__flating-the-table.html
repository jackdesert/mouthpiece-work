of glass and hold it with one hand while I draw the mpc down from the point

of the paper and the glass are clean so that there are no little high spots.
I suppose one could tape one edge of the sandpaper down, but I like to
rotate the paper as I work.

There ar here in Japan small rolls of adhesive-backed sandpaper available
which I have found very useful in making shakuhachi flutes, as they lay firm
and flush against flat surfaces and do not slip. I have been thinking about
applying 3M Design Bond (a kind of spray adhesive) to the back of pieces of
sandpaper to attach them firmly to the glass surface but since I don&#39;t do
much mpc work I&#39;ve never really had the need.

The stuff I have comes in rolls about 4 inches wide. It&#39;s made by 3M, so you should be able to find it there. On the back it says "Tri-M-ite Fre-Cut Paper A wt. Open Coat". It&#39;s not cheap--about $4 a roll--but they&#39;re pretty long. Comes in different grits too. 

Good luck,

Toby
