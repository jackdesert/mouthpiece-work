            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s probably not the best way, but I just lay the sandpaper flat on a piece
of glass and hold it with one hand while I draw the mpc down from the point
where I have anchored the paper. It&#39;s important to make sure that the back
of the paper and the glass are clean so that there are no little high spots.
I suppose one could tape one edge of the sandpaper down, but I like to
rotate the paper as I work.

There ar here in Japan small rolls of adhesive-backed sandpaper available
which I have found very useful in making shakuhachi flutes, as they lay firm
and flush against flat surfaces and do not slip. I have been thinking about
applying 3M Design Bond (a kind of spray adhesive) to the back of pieces of
sandpaper to attach them firmly to the glass surface but since I don&#39;t do
much mpc work I&#39;ve never really had the need.

I&#39;ve been looking for the adhesive backed sandpaper you alluded to in your email....can you tell me more about it?  Is it manufactured by any known company in the U.S.?  Does it come in all types of grades?  Where did you get yours?

Would appreciate your help in locating some.

Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Fred,

The stuff I have comes in rolls about 4 inches wide. It&#39;s made by 3M, so you should be able to find it there. On the back it says "Tri-M-ite Fre-Cut Paper A wt. Open Coat". It&#39;s not cheap--about $4 a roll--but they&#39;re pretty long. Comes in different grits too. 

Good luck,

Toby
