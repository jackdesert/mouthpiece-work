            <pre class='message__body'>I put some pictures on my new site at MojoMouthpieceWork.com in 
the "For Sale" section. Payment info:

$18.50 each + $3.50 s/h (US), +$7 s/h (International).

Check, MO or Paypal to KWBradbury@....  Please add $1 if using a 
Credit Card Paypal to MojoMouthpieceWork@...

Indicate if you want a Set Back or End Zero gage.  No additional s/h if 
you want up to 4.  For more, ask me.

The lines are more uniform than in the one sample I had before placing 
the order.  As I reported in message #3905, the lines are thicker than 
the Babbitt gage lines.  But I am pleased overall with the quality and 
I think you will be too.

Thanks for your patience on this project.

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice new site Keith!

Please set aside one of each gauge for me. I&#39;ll get a MO in the mail 
to you.

Please add $1 PER GAGE

if using a Credit Card Paypal to MojoMouthpieceWork@...

(I do not have enough margin on these to absorb the fees.)
