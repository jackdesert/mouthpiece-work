            <pre class='message__body'>I doubt that saliva has much effect on the sounding of the mpc. I was an oboe player for many years, and the reed stape is so small that even a small coating of saliva inside changes the shape and size proportionally much more than in a mpc, and it has no noticeable effect. The walls of the bore need to be rigid, and saliva is not rigid, therefore it would not effectively change the shape or size of the bore. It might slightly change the tonal characteristics by having some effect on the boundary layer, but it would be small.

Probably a Britone, made in the UK. I had my hands on one years ago, 
never got to play it. Ralph Morgan, I believe, in one of his SJ 
columns described the sound as extremely shrill. a friend of mine had 
it with a bunch of other mpcs, but we searched and searched and 
couldn&#39;t find it again.

I&#39;ve seen Britone&#39;s for alto and tenor. Played the tenor one - shrill 
may be an understatement.

Thanks to all for so qualified venting of my questions and thanks in 
advance for possible further interesting additions. 

They say there are no bad questions, there are bad answers.
I want to ask some of such sort. 

Introduction:

I want to reinvent, design and build 2 competitive fixtures for
A) making any permanent given radius and length facings;
B) putting a copy of customer&#39;s MP fancy facing on the another MP; 
the artisan saves the curve on a phisical carrier- cardboard disk 
with original MP&#39;s measuring marks; during the copy-recording/making 
process he does not use feeler gages but controls the tip opening. 
Both fixtures are manual, not CNC, provides equal siderails 
height by their very nature.

  Question 1.
I want to know how high the bar is: what times it takes to make each 
of mentioned facings by some good MP refacer having no CNC machine 
but using his very private technique and equipment. (Chamber work is 
excluded). (Please do not mention any names!)
  Question 2.
What percentage of customers are satisfied with radial curve? By 
other words: which fixture would be more on demand?

Fixture price roughest intuitive estimation would be 700 US$ for 
either plus minus 30%.
