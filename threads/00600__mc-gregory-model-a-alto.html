Is there anyone who is willing to sell an
 
MC Gregory Model A alto in original 4A16?

I have been looking for one everywhere without success
and i thought some of the mouthpiece enthuasists in
here might come across...

If anyone has one or knows one really well, I have 
a question. A Gregory model A is ostensibly
a really dark sounding piece, for its conservative
design(low chamber and round chamber, rounded innersided
walls), but I have read that it actually sounds
Bright in a unique way, plasticky and ringing? I hear that
sound in some of Art Pepper and Paul Desmond&#39;s tone.
Which area of the mouthpiece can create that unique
brightness in the tone despite its low baffle and
rounded inner sidewalls+round chamber? Could it be the 
short facing? or the small tip opening? or what else?
A help from experienced people would be very appreciated.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have an MC Gregory tenor piece and it is indeed as you describe. It&#39;s a 5 but still very closed--in fact I have trouble finding reeds hard enough to play it. At first glance the interior configuration appears similar to a Yani 7 that I have, but the response is totally different. The Yani has a quite "round" full bodied tone. The Gregory has the same body but with a very clean high "bite" is the only way I can describe it. The Yani sounds dull and stuffy by comparison. I have a Berg Larsen metal mpc as well (I can&#39;t give you specs as I completely reworked it) which has a nice clear tone and good projection, but nowhere near the fullness of the Gregory. The Gregory is an all-round good piece and I hope you are successful in your search.

The only clue I have as to why the low-baffled Gregory might have such a nice edge while still resembling the Yani is the fact that the chamber and throat are much more open than in the Yani. It seems paradoxical as one would expect that a larger chamber would darken the sound, but this is not the case.

You&#39;ve piqued my interest. Perhaps if I have time in the next couple of days I will do a little comparison of the two mpcs and repost.

            <pre class='message__body'>This opens the whole can of worms about whet effect the material of a mpc has on the tone. I personally think (based on all my reading of the science involved) that the effect is really minimal--almost unnoticeable. I believe Phil Barone has said the same thing--that as long as the internal dimensions are similar the material doesn&#39;t matter. On the other hand Jon van Wie thinks differently. 

The problem is that to really find out you have to eliminate all the variables except the material. This would mean making identical mpcs (at least inside dimensions) in different materials. Phil has that ability and I tend to side with him. Certainly the acoustical scientists would claim to a man that this is the case. They say that very small differences in the dimensions can make a big difference, but that materials of the same smoothness will all sound alike, as long as they are rigid enough not to deform under the pressure of the sound waves generated by the beating reed . There will be some small vibrational deformation of the material caused by the slap of the reed but it is not hard to see that that too is minimal compared to the displacement of the reed tip. There would be a slight difference based on the differing thermal coefficients, but we are talking about absolutely inaudible differences here. 

I&#39;d be happy to send references if you are interested in reading up on the effects of wall materials in woodwind instruments.

There also may be something to the softness of Dukoff Silverlite.  
I&#39;m not real sure since I do not have any plastic Dukoffs to compare

Vintage rubber may be a little warmer than hard plastic, but a lot of 
this perception is how it feels in your mouth, which may make you 
play differently.

I think all of the harder materials sound too similar for me to note 
consistant tonal differences.  But I think metals are darker than non-

sound like michael brecker or lester young within the same phrase; 
really quite amazing; and the projection was incredibly clear, even when

responds faster, but i really don&#39;t know that i can agree with that; i 
think it is all about getting the reed to vibrate the way the player 
wants it; i think there are too many other variables in mpc design to 
make material much of a factor; but i am no doubt the most inexperienced 
person this list, trust me.

I pretty sure there is something to the properties of Delrin used in
Ruyons Quantums and XLs.  These are also thin-walled mouthpieces.  I
think they participate in the vibrations and are louder than their
metal conterparts.

There also may be something to the softness of Dukoff Silverlite.
I&#39;m not real sure since I do not have any plastic Dukoffs to compare
them to.

Vintage rubber may be a little warmer than hard plastic, but a lot of
this perception is how it feels in your mouth, which may make you
play differently.

I think all of the harder materials sound too similar for me to note
consistant tonal differences.  But I think metals are darker than non-
metals.

            <pre class='message__body'>Just FYI concerning the criticality of internal dimensions let me relate a little story of a controlled experiment run to determine the effect of body tube material on flute sound.

Four identical handmade Sankyo flutes were tested, two in silver, one in gold and one in palladium. The handmade flutes were chosen because of tighter manufacturing tolerances. Two in silver to act as a control, i.e. the researchers planned to do spectral analysis of the two silver flutes first to determine the variability of response due to manufacturing differences--to get to know the playing field and eliminate those variables.

To the researchers&#39; surprise, the differences between the two silver flutes were so great that the experiment had to be abandoned. Now here were two flutes whose tolerances were as fine as technologically possible, and still the minute differences in manufacture created differences in response far beyond the effect of the materials, which could therefore not be accurately measured.

The only conclusion that the researches could point to was that the gold flute seemed to have a sound with slightly less of the 7th harmonic. Since this is present only in a very small proportion in the lower octave and disappears completely in the second octave it made no difference to the sound.

When we talk about "identical dimensions" it is best to realize that even the finest manufacturing tolerances permit wide variability in response.

I&#39;m not trying to get on anyone&#39;s case, just trying to promote some critical thinking and questioning of prevailing misconceptions.

  I have experimented using a Quantum Delrin as the basis and having a
  Bronzite model of the same mpc made up. The internal dimensions are
  identical but the two mpcs play differently, the Delrin model is a little
  more alive and vibrant whilst the Bronzite required more air to get it to
  sing and resonate.

            <pre class='message__body'>The MC Gregory model "A" and the early "Master" mouthpieces had quite 
a thin beak roof/baffle/biteplate (at least, that&#39;s how it looks on 
the "Master" I&#39;ve seen, and so I&#39;ve been told about the model "A").

I read somewhere (article by Ralph Morgan???) that the thickness of 
the material has a lot to do with the tone too. Starting with thick 
walls, as you thin them down (no doubt, from the outside to make sure 
you keep the chamber the same), nothing much happens until a point 
where the mouthpiece becomes unplayable quite suddenly. If you 
continue thinning it down past this point, after a while it suddenly 
becomes playable again - extremely playable, and it (apparently) has 
a much better tone (brighter???).

This was the case with hard rubber only, and metal didn&#39;t have the 
same effect. I think it was in an article about the effect of the 
material on the tone, but I can&#39;t really remember now.

I hope this helps.

Danny

            <pre class='message__body'>What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the reed 
vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply rolling 
closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip 
first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course, still 
on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly, then 
as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the reed, 
causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed opening up 
again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if" type 
of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what the 
exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my 
speculative pondering or not?

very small differences in the dimensions can make a big difference, 
but that materials of the same smoothness will all sound alike, as 
long as they are rigid enough not to deform under the pressure of the 
sound waves generated by the beating reed . There will be some small 
vibrational deformation of the material caused by the slap of the 
reed but it is not hard to see that that too is minimal compared to 
the displacement of the reed tip. There would be a slight difference 
based on the differing thermal coefficients, but we are talking about 
absolutely inaudible differences here.

            <pre class='message__body'>The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is effectively the thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It can only flex perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the center which causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive studies of reeds on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the tip--no other movement of any significance. There is some question about how long the closed part of the cycle lasts.

Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might have some effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some flexing in the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3 dB due to this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking small potatoes compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior. 

As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic science circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material makes a significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming "rich" tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to all be hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection on the subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials in other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and pianos, where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame. Compression waves in the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the instrument are only there to define a shape for the air so that it can vibrate effectively. To say that walls change the sound--assuming they are sufficiently rigid and smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle barrel affects how far a bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with instrument bodies. Ad mouthpieces.

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: MC Gregory Model A alto


  What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the reed 
  vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply rolling 
  closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

  Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip 
  first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course, still 
  on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly, then 
  as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the reed, 
  causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed opening up 
  again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if" type 
  of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

  Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what the 
  exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my 
  speculative pondering or not?

            <pre class='message__body'>The Runyon Quantum is very thin-walled as compared to other mouthpieces,
and with the Delrin material, you can even feel the vibration of the
material.  The tone difference is audible between the metal and delrin
versions.  But I agree, normally, with thicker mouthpieces, the material
does not affect the tone to any real extent.

The Runyon XL (delrin) and Runyon Smoothbore Metal are the same design,
but different materials.  These models are somewhat thicker than the
Quantum, and do not sound any differently, as the thicker material
apparently does not vibrate as much.

I feel that these models may be compared, as the only difference is
material, they are the exact same in all other respects.

But to compare, for example, a Selmer S-80 rubber to the Selmer metal is
not a valid comparison as the chambers are different.

            <pre class='message__body'>A gold Flute does play quite differently from a silver flute. The material
and cut of the embouchure has a more significant effect on the tone, as does
the material that the Chimney is made from. Gold, Platinum and silver all
respond differently when you play them on a Flute, there is a noticeable
difference in resistance to the player.

Material of mpcs also does make a difference, I have experienced the same
things Paul describes with the Quantum mpcs. I have even had a Bronzite
model made up as well, an exact replica of a Quantum and it plays
differently to the Delrin and the Metal model.

  The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is effectively the
thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It can only flex
perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the center which
causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive studies of reeds
on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the tip--no other
movement of any significance. There is some question about how long the
closed part of the cycle lasts.

  Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might have some
effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some flexing in
the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3 dB due to
this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking small potatoes
compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior.

  As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic science
circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material makes a
significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming "rich"
tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to all be
hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection on the
subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials in
other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and pianos,
where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the
exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to
see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with
the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

  Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame. Compression waves in
the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the instrument are only
there to define a shape for the air so that it can vibrate effectively. To
say that walls change the sound--assuming they are sufficiently rigid and
smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle barrel affects how far a
bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in
dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the
expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the
projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with instrument bodies.
Ad mouthpieces.

    What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the reed
    vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply rolling
    closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

    Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip
    first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course, still
    on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly, then
    as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the reed,
    causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed opening up
    again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if" type
    of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

    Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what the
    exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my
    speculative pondering or not?

    reed but it is not hard to see that that too is minimal compared to
    the displacement of the reed tip. There would be a slight difference
    based on the differing thermal coefficients, but we are talking about
    absolutely inaudible differences here.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have to respectfully disagree Bootman. At present I have two handmade silver flutes, and in the past have owned or played a number of good Boehm flutes in silver, gold, wood and early plated handmade French flutes. I found nothing that could have been attributable to the material rather than the chimney height, undercut angle, tube smoothness and diameter, head dimensions, etc. It&#39;s a myth pure and simple that the material affects the tone, and everyone has bought into it and perpetuates it. I had a Grenadilla Haynes that played much more like my silver Haynes than my silver Haynes played like my present Powell flute. 

I think the link I provided earlier to the Coltman paper in the Marl collection at Stanford might make interesting reading for you. I think most of the differences that players find between flutes of different materials is what they expect to find.

Yours,

  A gold Flute does play quite differently from a silver flute. The material and cut of the embouchure has a more significant effect on the tone, as does the material that the Chimney is made from. Gold, Platinum and silver all respond differently when you play them on a Flute, there is a noticeable difference in resistance to the player.

  Material of mpcs also does make a difference, I have experienced the same things Paul describes with the Quantum mpcs. I have even had a Bronzite model made up as well, an exact replica of a Quantum and it plays differently to the Delrin and the Metal model.

    The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is effectively the thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It can only flex perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the center which causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive studies of reeds on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the tip--no other movement of any significance. There is some question about how long the closed part of the cycle lasts.

    Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might have some effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some flexing in the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3 dB due to this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking small potatoes compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior. 

    As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic science circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material makes a significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming "rich" tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to all be hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection on the subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials in other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and pianos, where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

    Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame. Compression waves in the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the instrument are only there to define a shape for the air so that it can vibrate effectively. To say that walls change the sound--assuming they are sufficiently rigid and smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle barrel affects how far a bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with instrument bodies. Ad mouthpieces.

      What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the reed 
      vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply rolling 
      closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

      Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip 
      first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course, still 
      on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly, then 
      as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the reed, 
      causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed opening up 
      again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if" type 
      of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

      Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what the 
      exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my 
      speculative pondering or not?

            <pre class='message__body'>Backus wrote a book called "The Acoustical Foundations of Music" and was a prime investigator of clarinet acoustics and reed behavior. Other "stars" in the field are Thomas D. Rossing and Neville H. Fletcher who co-authored a book called "The Physics of Music", I beileve. Arthur Benade also wrote a couple of excellent books which I don&#39;t have. If you&#39;re a math whiz check out Nederveen&#39;s "Acoustical Aspects of Woodwind Instruments". Finally Coltman did some seminal experiments having to do with the effect of wall materials on flute tone (conclusion: none). His flute paper is available on line in the Marl collection (as well as some others) at the link I provided earlier.

Backus&#39; book is the least technical and contains a bunch of very interesting info.

            <pre class='message__body'>Arthur Benade was both a clarinetist AND physicist.  He has many papers,
and several books, at the Stanford site.  While he chose to model the
clarinet in most of his experiments, there is much to apply to the
saxophone.

I have given links to all of this in an earlier post.

            <pre class='message__body'>And I have to respectfully disagree with Toby.  I readily agree that the
physical/dimensional design elements are the primary controlling factors in
response and tone color, but it&#39;s ludicrous to completely dismiss the effect
of materials.

If material was of no matter, why then do we have silver trumpets, gold
flutes, and copper saxophones?  Why aren&#39;t all metal wind instruments simply
made of lacquered brass, or whatever would be the easiest and cheapest metal
to form?

I dare say that decades, if not centuries, of manufacturing expertise and
the opinions of countless virtuosos carries a great deal more weight with me
than a handful of clinical studies.

But moreover, my own playing experience has taught me that there is a
difference between the tone of a saxophone with a sterling silver neck and
one with a brass neck.  And my old clear plastic mouthpiece produces a
brighter sound than an ebonite mouthpiece of similar, albeit not identical,
design.  I can hear it, various audiences for whom I have played have heard
and commented on it.  Bootman even heard it on some crappy mp3s I recorded
with it last year.

So I guess we just have to agree to disagree on this one.

I have to respectfully disagree Bootman. At present I have two handmade
silver flutes, and in the past have owned or played a number of good Boehm
flutes in silver, gold, wood and early plated handmade French flutes. I
found nothing that could have been attributable to the material rather than
the chimney height, undercut angle, tube smoothness and diameter, head
dimensions, etc. It&#39;s a myth pure and simple that the material affects the
tone, and everyone has bought into it and perpetuates it. I had a Grenadilla
Haynes that played much more like my silver Haynes than my silver Haynes
played like my present Powell flute.

I think the link I provided earlier to the Coltman paper in the Marl
collection at Stanford might make interesting reading for you. I think most
of the differences that players find between flutes of different materials
is what they expect to find.

  A gold Flute does play quite differently from a silver flute. The material
and cut of the embouchure has a more significant effect on the tone, as does
the material that the Chimney is made from. Gold, Platinum and silver all
respond differently when you play them on a Flute, there is a noticeable
difference in resistance to the player.

  Material of mpcs also does make a difference, I have experienced the same
things Paul describes with the Quantum mpcs. I have even had a Bronzite
model made up as well, an exact replica of a Quantum and it plays
differently to the Delrin and the Metal model.

    The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is effectively the
thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It can only flex
perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the center which
causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive studies of reeds
on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the tip--no other
movement of any significance. There is some question about how long the
closed part of the cycle lasts.

    Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might have some
effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some flexing in
the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3 dB due to
this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking small potatoes
compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior.

    As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic science
circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material makes a
significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming "rich"
tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to all be
hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection on the
subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials in
other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and pianos,
where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the
exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to
see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with
the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

    Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame. Compression waves in
the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the instrument are only
there to define a shape for the air so that it can vibrate effectively. To
say that walls change the sound--assuming they are sufficiently rigid and
smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle barrel affects how far a
bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in
dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the
expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the
projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with instrument bodies.

      What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the reed
      vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply rolling
      closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

      Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip
      first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course, still
      on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly, then
      as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the reed,
      causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed opening up
      again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if" type
      of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

      Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what the
      exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my
      speculative pondering or not?

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,
There is a difference between wood and the various other material flutes are
made of. I have played these model that you speak of and I am not a fan of
Haynes, they sound good up to a point but a good Muramatsu sounds as good
and probably is a little darker. I have played several $40,000 gold flutes
and they do take more air to get resonating than does an identical model in
solid silver. Silver does respond faster than does gold in terms of a flute
body. Platinum feels and plays differently again to both gold and silver. I
am fortunate enough to have access to well known flute maker who has many of
the head joints and flutes at hand. Personally I love the sound and feel of
Gold flutes ( I can&#39;t afford one though) so I use a solid silver Muramatsu
with a solid gold tube platinum lip and riser head joint. I also have a
solid silver head joint for this same flute, the sound difference between
these two head joints is dramatic. I also have a solid silver head platinum
lip and riser head joint to which responds very differently to the gold tube
head joint. I also have a wooden head joint for this same flute. Each head
joint changes the way these flutes behave and play. These are just my own
flutes, I have also played many more different flutes.

There is a difference in playing of these various materials of flute. These
differences that are apparent to the player may not show up as readily in a
lab test. I may try this at home here and use a spectrum analysis program. I
will post the results. A = 440Hz and A = 880Hz..

Scientific or psuedo scientific studies are well and good but in the end it
comes down to what a given performer feels most comfortable with when
performing. We mustn&#39;t lose sight of the big picture here for the details.

A metal mpc does indeed respond differently to a Hard Rubber model which
again is different to a plastic model.

        long as they are rigid enough not to deform under the pressure of
the
        sound waves generated by the beating reed . There will be some small
        vibrational deformation of the material caused by the slap of the
        reed but it is not hard to see that that too is minimal compared to
        the displacement of the reed tip. There would be a slight difference
        based on the differing thermal coefficients, but we are talking
about
        absolutely inaudible differences here.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

Is there anything that you know of that deals with everything 
required to produce a good acoustic design of an entire sax? Why I 
ask is that one of my "pipe dreams" is to design and build a 
saxophone myself - purely for the satisfaction of being able to 
say "I made it myself" (and possibly also for trying out some ideas 
that I&#39;ve been having on how to improve the instrument - ideas that 
would change a few things from the current status quo - at least for 
that horn).

Also, thanks for the info confirming that the only movement of the 
reed is that of curving around the facing profile. I thought that 
would be the case, but I thought I would bring up the possibilty of a 
more complex form of movement, just in case someone had heard of such 
a thing happening.

due to the very real effect of wall materials in other types of 
musical instruments such as violins and guitars and pianos, where the 
vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the exciting

they are sufficiently rigid and smooth--is like saying that the 
material of a rifle barrel affects how far a bullet will travel and 
with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in dimension and 
smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the expanding 
gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the projectile

            <pre class='message__body'>Bootman has just jolted my memory....

During the time when I was a mad pipe-organ fanatic, I purchased the 
two-volume set "The art of organ building" by Audsley (forgot his 
Christian name). As far as organ pipes are concerned, both wooden and 
metal pipes show different tonal characteristics according to the 
material used. This isn&#39;t limited to whether it&#39;s pipe-metal 
(basically solder), or wood, but also depends on what proportion of 
the metal is tin, what proportion is lead, what proportion is another 
alloying compound, or on the other hand, what type of wood it is, and 
even how tight the grain is.

However, this being said, it should be noted that the pipes are 
usually thin enough to become a part of the whole resonance - it&#39;s 
obvious that the material will have an effect in this case - the 
microscopic deflections change the basic shape, and the tone 
character. Where the material is thick enough to not resonate with 
the sound waves, the only sound coulouring effect is the frequency 
ranges that a particular material will absorb/reflect the best 
(which, when all said and done, still comes down to microscopic 
surface resonance effects).

Thinking about it, a classic example is that of playing a sax against 
a thick, solid plate-glass window, and then playing it against a 
thick, solid piece of wooden furniture. The sound reflection from the 
wood will invariably sound more warm than that from the glass, 
irrespective of the smoothness of the finish of each material, etc. 
This is, of course, playing the same horn, with the same mouthpiece, 
same reed, same ligature, same embouchure, same note, etc, etc, etc, 
within the same room, from the same position in the room. Basically, 
there is an interaction between the material and the soundwaves (at 
least in this instance), where one material will absorb certain 
frequencies that another material won&#39;t (pointing back to the 
microscopic stuff again).

However, I don&#39;t know how far this effect goes - playing against 
brick as opposed to concrete (of the same surface roughness) doesn&#39;t 
seem to sound any different to each other (at least to me). Likewise 
with smooth concrete, as opposed to plate glass (I haven&#39;t tried 
playing against plate metal yet, so I can&#39;t comment on that one). 
However, playing against concrete or glass sounds different (to me) 
to playing against wood. The one thing that I have noticed is that 
where the material is harder/more solid/more inflexible, the less 
overtones it absorbs (pointing again to the microscopic stuff). It&#39;s 
probably for this reason that playing against wood has the "warming" 
effect: most types of wood are softer than glass and concrete (etc), 
so it&#39;s surface is easier for the sound waves to deform 
microscopically.

But once again, it&#39;s really coming down to the difference between the 
material taking part in the resonance, and the material simply 
rigidly containing and shaping it - a difference that (to a large 
extent, but certainly not 100%) depends on the thickness of the 
material.

Anyway, that&#39;s just another 2 cents worth.

            <pre class='message__body'>thanks, my library is in boxes while we prepare to move; i remember 
really enjoying the physics class that the music department had 
developed with the physics department (Cal State Northridege back in the 
mid and late 1970s);  the central theme that i came away with is that 
there is a lot of misunderstanding among musicians about acoustics and 
the physics of music.

            <pre class='message__body'>The reed does not simply curve around the facing, but remains stationary
for approximately 180 degrees of the cycle, and moves for approximately
180 degrees of the cycle.  During the part of the cycle where it is in
motion, it moves in a series of jerks (perhaps corresponding to the
overtones?).

So, the motion of the reed is still quite complex.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey Mike,

Yep, I guess we just agree to disagree. I used to think just like you do, but after reading countless papers and getting some understanding of what the physicists were talking about I began to wonder just how much I cound definitely attribute to materials, and the grudging answer I finally came up with was "none". 

The "clinical" studies that you refer to were the only examples of rigorous attempts to exclude other variables such as differing bore dimensions--even the"feel" of the instrument in the players hands. Coltman&#39;s famous experiment using identical flutes made of different materials is a good example: to make sure that the player could not identify the instrument by feel he made sure that the surfaces were identical to the touch, and mounted all three flutes on a rotating wheel so that the players couldn&#39;t tell by weight which was which. He then had a number of players and listeners play/listen to the flutes at random in a double blind situation and asked them to say which was which. Neither the players nor the listeners came up with anything statistically over average guessing odds--IOW with all visual and tactile clues removed neither the players nor the listeners knew which was which. Only one player sussed out one clue--he knew that one of the flutes warmed up faster than the other two.

Very careful studies have been made with accelerometers to understand the nature of the vibrations that the walls undergo during playing and the conclusions are that wall vibrations alone in instruments of cylindrical cross section can contribute at most about 1/10000 the amount of sound energy that the air column produces. Not much.

And in terms of your question as to why people make instruments out of precious metals I would answer that they do so for the same reasons that they make jewellery out of those same metals--they look pretty and they have status. It&#39;s worth noting that many of the early handmade Boehm flutes of famous makers such as Louis Lot, Bonneville and August Hammig to name three, were made of silver plated nickel. I had an old plated Bonneville as well as a silver Bonneville and they were both excellent flutes. Marcel Moyse, one of the flute greats of the 20th century played his entire career on a nickel flute. And Georges Barrere, the eminent French flutist who was presented a platinum flute by Haynes (and for whom Density 21.5 was written in honor of the fact) once confided to an acquaintance of mine that he hated the flute. He claimed that the flute was "dead" but that he had promised Haynes that he would play it. Another flutist who was there tried Barrere&#39;s flute and confirmed that.

Why do people buy gold Rolex watches when the stainless ones tell time just as well?

As a maker of shakuhachi flutes, in which the bores are built by hand with stone and lacquer paste, I can confirm that variations of as little as 1/100 of an inch can cause big changes in response in critical areas. Did you measure the two sax necks you mention to make sure that they were identical to that degree? If not I don&#39;t think you can claim unequivocally that the difference was caused by the material.

Because the players are so vociferous about materials making a difference the scientists have been looking hard for the last 150 years. They have yet to come up with anything to support that claim. 

It may be that the scientists have not been able to find it, but it might also mean that it doesn&#39;t exist. 

My 2 cents :~}

  And I have to respectfully disagree with Toby.  I readily agree that the
  physical/dimensional design elements are the primary controlling factors in
  response and tone color, but it&#39;s ludicrous to completely dismiss the effect
  of materials.

  If material was of no matter, why then do we have silver trumpets, gold
  flutes, and copper saxophones?  Why aren&#39;t all metal wind instruments simply
  made of lacquered brass, or whatever would be the easiest and cheapest metal
  to form?

  I dare say that decades, if not centuries, of manufacturing expertise and
  the opinions of countless virtuosos carries a great deal more weight with me
  than a handful of clinical studies.

  But moreover, my own playing experience has taught me that there is a
  difference between the tone of a saxophone with a sterling silver neck and
  one with a brass neck.  And my old clear plastic mouthpiece produces a
  brighter sound than an ebonite mouthpiece of similar, albeit not identical,
  design.  I can hear it, various audiences for whom I have played have heard
  and commented on it.  Bootman even heard it on some crappy mp3s I recorded
  with it last year.

  So I guess we just have to agree to disagree on this one.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have an Almeida handmade and a Powell handmade silver flute. the tubes are identical in diameter--the heads are interchangeable. The two headjoints are very close as far as I can measure with my vernier calipers. The Almeida is a classic old Powell style head with a rectangular embouchure hole. The Powell head is a Cooper style. The difference is like night and day. There are significant differences in the way the bodies take air and respond as well, which is quite remarkable when you think that these are two cylinders with identical diameters.

With differences like those in two flutes of the same materials I don&#39;t know how anyone can claim to tell the differences caused by the materials. This was also the conclusion in the flute test I mentioned a few posts back.

You say that it takes more air to make a gold flute "resonate". What does that mean? The total expansion of a flute tube caused by pressure waves in the bore is well under a millionth of a meter. It is the air vibrating in the tube that causes the sound, not the vibrations of the tube.

I&#39;ve played quite a few flutes in different materials too and I&#39;ve never noticed any consistent differences that couldn&#39;t be attributed to variances in internal dimensions.

I&#39;m not saying that the materials make no difference, only that the difference is several orders of magnitude below what most folks think.

So I guess I also have to agree to disagree on this with you too ;~)

  Toby,
  There is a difference between wood and the various other material flutes are made of. I have played these model that you speak of and I am not a fan of Haynes, they sound good up to a point but a good Muramatsu sounds as good and probably is a little darker. I have played several $40,000 gold flutes and they do take more air to get resonating than does an identical model in solid silver. Silver does respond faster than does gold in terms of a flute body. Platinum feels and plays differently again to both gold and silver. I am fortunate enough to have access to well known flute maker who has many of the head joints and flutes at hand. Personally I love the sound and feel of Gold flutes ( I can&#39;t afford one though) so I use a solid silver Muramatsu with a solid gold tube platinum lip and riser head joint. I also have a solid silver head joint for this same flute, the sound difference between these two head joints is dramatic. I also have a solid silver head platinum lip and riser head joint to which responds very differently to the gold tube head joint. I also have a wooden head joint for this same flute. Each head joint changes the way these flutes behave and play. These are just my own flutes, I have also played many more different flutes.

  There is a difference in playing of these various materials of flute. These differences that are apparent to the player may not show up as readily in a lab test. I may try this at home here and use a spectrum analysis program. I will post the results. A = 440Hz and A = 880Hz..

  Scientific or psuedo scientific studies are well and good but in the end it comes down to what a given performer feels most comfortable with when performing. We mustn&#39;t lose sight of the big picture here for the details.

  A metal mpc does indeed respond differently to a Hard Rubber model which again is different to a plastic model.

    I have to respectfully disagree Bootman. At present I have two handmade silver flutes, and in the past have owned or played a number of good Boehm flutes in silver, gold, wood and early plated handmade French flutes. I found nothing that could have been attributable to the material rather than the chimney height, undercut angle, tube smoothness and diameter, head dimensions, etc. It&#39;s a myth pure and simple that the material affects the tone, and everyone has bought into it and perpetuates it. I had a Grenadilla Haynes that played much more like my silver Haynes than my silver Haynes played like my present Powell flute. 

    I think the link I provided earlier to the Coltman paper in the Marl collection at Stanford might make interesting reading for you. I think most of the differences that players find between flutes of different materials is what they expect to find.

    Yours,

      A gold Flute does play quite differently from a silver flute. The material and cut of the embouchure has a more significant effect on the tone, as does the material that the Chimney is made from. Gold, Platinum and silver all respond differently when you play them on a Flute, there is a noticeable difference in resistance to the player.

      Material of mpcs also does make a difference, I have experienced the same things Paul describes with the Quantum mpcs. I have even had a Bronzite model made up as well, an exact replica of a Quantum and it plays differently to the Delrin and the Metal model.

        The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is effectively the thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It can only flex perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the center which causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive studies of reeds on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the tip--no other movement of any significance. There is some question about how long the closed part of the cycle lasts.

        Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might have some effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some flexing in the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3 dB due to this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking small potatoes compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior. 

        As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic science circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material makes a significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming "rich" tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to all be hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection on the subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials in other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and pianos, where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

        Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame. Compression waves in the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the instrument are only there to define a shape for the air so that it can vibrate effectively. To say that walls change the sound--assuming they are sufficiently rigid and smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle barrel affects how far a bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with instrument bodies. Ad mouthpieces.

          What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the reed 
          vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply rolling 
          closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

          Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip 
          first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course, still 
          on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly, then 
          as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the reed, 
          causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed opening up 
          again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if" type 
          of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

          Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what the 
          exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my 
          speculative pondering or not?

          the displacement of the reed tip. There would be a slight difference 
          based on the differing thermal coefficients, but we are talking about 
          absolutely inaudible differences here.

            <pre class='message__body'>Some interesting points Danny,

Bore smoothness apparently has a BIG effect on the sound (much more than the material). There is a boundary layer right next to the wall itself (out to about .1 mm if I remember correctly). Air molecues can be considerably slowed down and lose energy if the surface is rough. So the grain of the wood can have much more effect on the sound than the fact that the material is wood per se. The key is rigidity--as long as the rigidity is high enough the material makes no difference.

There is a caveat in the material question and it concerns the thermal coefficient (I think it is called) of the material. So materials (like heavy draperies) absorb sound and convert the energy to heat. Other materials (like metals)  don&#39;t (to the same degree). The range is rather wide, but in all materials used to make instruments the range is very narrow. We don&#39;t usually make instruments out of heavy draperies ;~)

The only research ever to show that materials had an effect on the sound was a study done with organ pipes, but this was done with tubes that were square, and that makes a lot of difference. With  tubes of elliptical or rectangular cross section the flat parts of the walls can be set to vibrating quite easily by the air column. This can&#39;t happen with round cross-sectional tubes--they can only expand and contract like a balloon being blown up.

I used to "ping" a flute holding it at the tenon to feel how "alive" it was. Those kinds of vibrations are elliptical deformations of the tube and are caused by striking it at one point. The vibrating air column is pushing outward equally all around, so those kinds of vibrations do not happen while you are playing.

Meaning no disrespect to anyone who believes differently, but I believe that 99% (at least) of differences perceived as due to materials has to do with the attitudes towards those materials of those concerned. The makers construct gold and platinum flutes more carefully, or the senior makers with more skill are assigned those instruments. And I know from my own case how much my preconceived notions of an instrument affect how I play it and adjust to its particular characteristics unconsciously, for better or worse. 

Maybe tomorrow those scientists will publish with findings that the materials do affect the response and tone and then I will have to rethink everything again, but until then I remain convinced that no one has shown that to be the case, and all claims to the contrary are unreliable because all other variables that have been shown to make a difference have not be considered and eliminated. 

I believed just the opposite for many years and I feel that I was "duped" and accepted the fact that gold flutes sound "richer" for instance without questioning it. I&#39;m on my high horse here hoping to make people question their conclusions. If they come to a different opinion after really thinking it through that&#39;s fine, I&#39;d just like to see them really explore the question in all its aspects.

Don&#39;t forget that before Columbus almost everyone, learned scholars included,  believed that the world was flat. And if it weren&#39;t for Copernicus we might still be thinking the universe revoles around the Earth. 

We would have had real trouble with those Moon shots ;~)

  Bootman has just jolted my memory....

  During the time when I was a mad pipe-organ fanatic, I purchased the 
  two-volume set "The art of organ building" by Audsley (forgot his 
  Christian name). As far as organ pipes are concerned, both wooden and 
  metal pipes show different tonal characteristics according to the 
  material used. This isn&#39;t limited to whether it&#39;s pipe-metal 
  (basically solder), or wood, but also depends on what proportion of 
  the metal is tin, what proportion is lead, what proportion is another 
  alloying compound, or on the other hand, what type of wood it is, and 
  even how tight the grain is.

  However, this being said, it should be noted that the pipes are 
  usually thin enough to become a part of the whole resonance - it&#39;s 
  obvious that the material will have an effect in this case - the 
  microscopic deflections change the basic shape, and the tone 
  character. Where the material is thick enough to not resonate with 
  the sound waves, the only sound coulouring effect is the frequency 
  ranges that a particular material will absorb/reflect the best 
  (which, when all said and done, still comes down to microscopic 
  surface resonance effects).

  Thinking about it, a classic example is that of playing a sax against 
  a thick, solid plate-glass window, and then playing it against a 
  thick, solid piece of wooden furniture. The sound reflection from the 
  wood will invariably sound more warm than that from the glass, 
  irrespective of the smoothness of the finish of each material, etc. 
  This is, of course, playing the same horn, with the same mouthpiece, 
  same reed, same ligature, same embouchure, same note, etc, etc, etc, 
  within the same room, from the same position in the room. Basically, 
  there is an interaction between the material and the soundwaves (at 
  least in this instance), where one material will absorb certain 
  frequencies that another material won&#39;t (pointing back to the 
  microscopic stuff again).

  However, I don&#39;t know how far this effect goes - playing against 
  brick as opposed to concrete (of the same surface roughness) doesn&#39;t 
  seem to sound any different to each other (at least to me). Likewise 
  with smooth concrete, as opposed to plate glass (I haven&#39;t tried 
  playing against plate metal yet, so I can&#39;t comment on that one). 
  However, playing against concrete or glass sounds different (to me) 
  to playing against wood. The one thing that I have noticed is that 
  where the material is harder/more solid/more inflexible, the less 
  overtones it absorbs (pointing again to the microscopic stuff). It&#39;s 
  probably for this reason that playing against wood has the "warming" 
  effect: most types of wood are softer than glass and concrete (etc), 
  so it&#39;s surface is easier for the sound waves to deform 
  microscopically.

  But once again, it&#39;s really coming down to the difference between the 
  material taking part in the resonance, and the material simply 
  rigidly containing and shaping it - a difference that (to a large 
  extent, but certainly not 100%) depends on the thickness of the 
  material.

  Anyway, that&#39;s just another 2 cents worth.

  The reed does not simply curve around the facing, but remains stationary for approximately 180 degrees of the cycle, and moves for approximately 180 degrees of the cycle.  During the part of the cycle where it is in motion, it moves in a series of jerks (perhaps corresponding to the overtones?). 
  So, the motion of the reed is still quite complex.

    Is there anything that you know of that deals with everything

    ask is that one of my "pipe dreams" is to design and build a 
    saxophone myself - purely for the satisfaction of being able to 
    say "I made it myself" (and possibly also for trying out some ideas 
    that I&#39;ve been having on how to improve the instrument - ideas that 
    would change a few things from the current status quo - at least for 
    that horn). 

    Also, thanks for the info confirming that the only movement of the 
    reed is that of curving around the facing profile. I thought that 
    would be the case, but I thought I would bring up the possibilty of a 
    more complex form of movement, just in case someone had heard of such 
    a thing happening.

    with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in dimension and 
    smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the expanding

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,
Lets agree to disagree, I have tried various heads on the same body,
different combinations of materials etc. I have a wooden head join there
that does indeed sound very different to silver head joint which in turn
sounds very different to a gold head joint. There is difference in
embouchure holes as well, more difference than can be found in the materials
the instrument is made from. The differences that a player feels to be huge
differences are perhaps not as obvious to the listener. The differences that
are apparent on the playing end change the physical way you play a given
instrument.

I also suppose that soldered and non soldered tone holes make no difference
to the sound of a flute either? I have found that there is a difference in
how the tone holes are formed in how a flute plays, same with a sax. Perhaps
these differences aren&#39;t able to measured by electronics. I also don&#39;t
totally believe in the infallibility of electronics and scientific
measurements either as the sensitivity of the human ear, within the hearing
range is pretty astonishing. There is also a difference in open hole and
closed hole flutes in how they feel and respond to the player, sonically
there is very little difference though.

I also prefer the sound of silver on the neck area of a sax, wether plated
or solid, it adds more focus to the sound of a given sax. I have proved this
to myself on more than one occasion with different saxophones too. I
experimented with a Selmer Bari neck, I played it as a lacquered neck, I
then stripped the neck and then I silver plated the same neck. The bare
brass was significantly more vibrant than the lacquer and the silver plate
was better again. The differences between the bare brass and the silver
where less pronounced than between the lacquer and the bare brass. I am
talking about how the sound of the instrument is to the player behind the
instrument.

  I have an Almeida handmade and a Powell handmade silver flute. the tubes
are identical in diameter--the heads are interchangeable. The two headjoints
are very close as far as I can measure with my vernier calipers. The Almeida
is a classic old Powell style head with a rectangular embouchure hole. The
Powell head is a Cooper style. The difference is like night and day. There
are significant differences in the way the bodies take air and respond as
well, which is quite remarkable when you think that these are two cylinders
with identical diameters.

  With differences like those in two flutes of the same materials I don&#39;t
know how anyone can claim to tell the differences caused by the materials.
This was also the conclusion in the flute test I mentioned a few posts back.

  You say that it takes more air to make a gold flute "resonate". What does
that mean? The total expansion of a flute tube caused by pressure waves in
the bore is well under a millionth of a meter. It is the air vibrating in
the tube that causes the sound, not the vibrations of the tube.

  I&#39;ve played quite a few flutes in different materials too and I&#39;ve never
noticed any consistent differences that couldn&#39;t be attributed to variances
in internal dimensions.

  I&#39;m not saying that the materials make no difference, only that the
difference is several orders of magnitude below what most folks think.

  So I guess I also have to agree to disagree on this with you too ;~)

    Toby,
    There is a difference between wood and the various other material flutes
are made of. I have played these model that you speak of and I am not a fan
of Haynes, they sound good up to a point but a good Muramatsu sounds as good
and probably is a little darker. I have played several $40,000 gold flutes
and they do take more air to get resonating than does an identical model in
solid silver. Silver does respond faster than does gold in terms of a flute
body. Platinum feels and plays differently again to both gold and silver. I
am fortunate enough to have access to well known flute maker who has many of
the head joints and flutes at hand. Personally I love the sound and feel of
Gold flutes ( I can&#39;t afford one though) so I use a solid silver Muramatsu
with a solid gold tube platinum lip and riser head joint. I also have a
solid silver head joint for this same flute, the sound difference between
these two head joints is dramatic. I also have a solid silver head platinum
lip and riser head joint to which responds very differently to the gold tube
head joint. I also have a wooden head joint for this same flute. Each head
joint changes the way these flutes behave and play. These are just my own
flutes, I have also played many more different flutes.

    There is a difference in playing of these various materials of flute.
These differences that are apparent to the player may not show up as readily
in a lab test. I may try this at home here and use a spectrum analysis
program. I will post the results. A = 440Hz and A = 880Hz..

    Scientific or psuedo scientific studies are well and good but in the end
it comes down to what a given performer feels most comfortable with when
performing. We mustn&#39;t lose sight of the big picture here for the details.

    A metal mpc does indeed respond differently to a Hard Rubber model which
again is different to a plastic model.

      I have to respectfully disagree Bootman. At present I have two
handmade silver flutes, and in the past have owned or played a number of
good Boehm flutes in silver, gold, wood and early plated handmade French
flutes. I found nothing that could have been attributable to the material
rather than the chimney height, undercut angle, tube smoothness and
diameter, head dimensions, etc. It&#39;s a myth pure and simple that the
material affects the tone, and everyone has bought into it and perpetuates
it. I had a Grenadilla Haynes that played much more like my silver Haynes
than my silver Haynes played like my present Powell flute.

      I think the link I provided earlier to the Coltman paper in the Marl
collection at Stanford might make interesting reading for you. I think most
of the differences that players find between flutes of different materials
is what they expect to find.

      Yours,

      Toby

        A gold Flute does play quite differently from a silver flute. The
material and cut of the embouchure has a more significant effect on the
tone, as does the material that the Chimney is made from. Gold, Platinum and
silver all respond differently when you play them on a Flute, there is a
noticeable difference in resistance to the player.

        Material of mpcs also does make a difference, I have experienced the
same things Paul describes with the Quantum mpcs. I have even had a Bronzite
model made up as well, an exact replica of a Quantum and it plays
differently to the Delrin and the Metal model.

          The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is effectively
the thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It can only
flex perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the center
which causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive studies of
reeds on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the tip--no other
movement of any significance. There is some question about how long the
closed part of the cycle lasts.

          Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might have
some effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some flexing
in the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3 dB due
to this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking small
potatoes compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior.

          As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic
science circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material
makes a significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming
"rich" tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to
all be hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection
on the subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials
in other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and
pianos, where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the
exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to
see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with
the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

          Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame. Compression
waves in the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the instrument are
only there to define a shape for the air so that it can vibrate effectively.
To say that walls change the sound--assuming they are sufficiently rigid and
smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle barrel affects how far a
bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in
dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the
expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the
projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with instrument bodies.
Ad mouthpieces.

            What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the
reed
            vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply
rolling
            closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

            Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip
            first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course,
still
            on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly,
then
            as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the
reed,
            causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed
opening up
            again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if"
type
            of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

            Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what
the
            exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my
            speculative pondering or not?

            unnoticeable. I believe Phil Barone has said the same

            matter. On the other hand Jon van Wie thinks differently.

that
            very small differences in the dimensions can make a big
difference,
            but that materials of the same smoothness will all sound alike,
as
            long as they are rigid enough not to deform under the pressure
of the
            sound waves generated by the beating reed . There will be some
small
            vibrational deformation of the material caused by the slap of
the
            reed but it is not hard to see that that too is minimal compared
to
            the displacement of the reed tip. There would be a slight
difference
            based on the differing thermal coefficients, but we are talking
about
            absolutely inaudible differences here.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,
Thanks for the reply. Quite interesting stuff. As an engineer, I can 
certainly relate to what you&#39;re saying (especially the "fluid 
mechanics" aspects). Personally, I believe that the material can make 
a difference, but not as much as most people might think (I like to 
be moderate in my thinking - at least to a certain extent). Of 
course, where there is no physically explainable reason for any 
difference, I believe that there isn&#39;t any difference (ie: if there 
is something that will cause a difference in the flow/vibration 
propagation characteristics, then sure - otherwise, I&#39;m a sceptic).

One of the main things (as far as I&#39;m concerned) is the rigidity. 
With large square (wooden - square pipes are rarely metal - but there 
are certian to be exceptions) organ pipes, it is quite easy to feel 
them vibrating (if they&#39;re made too thin, they&#39;ll rattle in their 
stands, and in severe cases even sound dull and thin in tone), so the 
wood that they&#39;re made from is usually quite important (due to the 
different rigidity, etc, properties of different timbers). However, 
when it gets to the smaller pipes, the thickness of the wood becomes 
quite large compared to the amount of vibrating air, so the material 
that they&#39;re made of becomes less important, to the point where it&#39;s 
totally unimportant. In fact, it has been known for ranks of wooden 
pipes to suddenly break into being metal pipes in their top octave 
(and more surprisingly, for reed-pipes to break off into small flue-
pipes (whistle type pipes) in their top octave), so this serves both 
points - depending on the scale of the material (and its rigidity) in 
comparison to the volume of air being set into vibration.

As an interesting side-note, I made a 2 foot "saxophone" pipe as per 
the description in Audsley&#39;s 2nd volume. It&#39;s a square wooden flue 
(whistle) pipe, having various little things here and there that 
change the tone slightly (by varying the way that the wind stream 
passes over the lip of the pipe). Man, I tell you it had a nice, rich 
sax tone. Audsley reported that the only organ he found with this 
stop had a better tone than the sax player that he sent into the 
bowels of the organ so that he could compare the tone. I have to 
admit that it&#39;s tone isn&#39;t that of Stan Getz or Paul Desmond, but it 
is a *very* nice sax tone - and absolutely no reed.

So the grain of the wood can have much more effect on the sound than 
the fact that the material is wood per se. The key is rigidity--as

The vibrating air column is pushing outward equally all around, so 
those kinds of vibrations do not happen while you are playing.
