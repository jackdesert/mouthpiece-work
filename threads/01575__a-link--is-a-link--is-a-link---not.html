            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve worked on a few Link STM pieces.  My general impression was that 
the current production STM NY is as described on Theo&#39;s site.  That 
is, a little wider than the regular STM.   This week I have a 7* STM 
NY and a 7* STM that I can compare side by side.  The NY is fairly 
new.  The regular may be a few years old.  The regular has "Super" in 
quotes, the NY does not.  Otherwise, these two pieces look identical 
(within manufacturing variation).   If anything, this NY is slightly 
narrower than the regular STM.  I&#39;ll start recording some outside 
body dimensions to see if I can make sense out of this over time.  It 
could be as simple as this NY being a miss-stamped regular STM.  Does 
anyone else out there have a comparison experience?

            <pre class='message__body'>I own recently purchased versions of the STM and the NY STM.  My STM is a 5 or 5* and the NY is a 7.  I&#39;ll try and get you some measurements.  They play differently in terms of tone for me.  The NY is smoother and has less edge to me than the STM.  I prefer the NY.
