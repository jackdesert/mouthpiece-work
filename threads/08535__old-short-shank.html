I opened up an old short-shank alto piece for a client (from .057 to .083), and it played fine, but had a slightly shrill brightness to it.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would take as much as you can off baffle near the tip first.  This reduces the brightness a lot for the amount of material removed.  Working in the throat, you need to take away a lot more material to get ta similar impact on brightness.  This could throw the intonation off (or fix it).  Curving sidewalls is fair game too.

No, it&#39;s not my new stage name.

I opened up an old short-shank alto piece for a client (from .057 to .083), and it played fine, but had a slightly shrill brightness to it. I had already reduced the baffle somewhat after opening it so much. I removed some more baffle, which improved it and gave it some more fullness, but there&#39;s still an unpleasant brightness to it. I think removing more baffle will just start to make it inefficient/ tubby.

Radial curve, 44 long, .083" tip. The .035 and .050 measurements are a tiny
bit short (like 1/4 mm), making a slight high spot there, but it plays really
easily, so I'm thinking the curve is OK. Tip rail is about .035" - not too
thin. I have indeed taken the baffle down considerably \\- I took some more
off today about 1/4" from the tip. Helped some, but then I went ahead and took
down the "ski jump" at the back end of the baffle. That eliminated quite a bit
of the "nasal" unpleasantness. I'm going to have the client play-test it again
before I do anything else.

  The "ski jump" was part of the original baffle (at the very back end) - it wasn&#39;t created by the refacing/opening process.  To be clear - when holding the mouthpiece upside down (the way you usually would to work on the tip or baffle) and sighting down the baffle, there&#39;s a rollover behind the tip (made much higher by opening the piece), then a section that slopes down (toward the "ceiling").  At the back of that, just where it drops off into the chamber, there was a little upturn.  I used riffler files to remove material way back there.

When I use the spreadsheet for elliptical curves, I get target numbers that
are nearly indistinguishable from radial numbers. With a small tip opening,
they only differ by .1 or .2 on the gauge (the difference is larger with a
larger tip opening). These are pretty close to the margin of error in
refacing. Am I getting something wrong here? I did some cutting and pasting,
so maybe I screwed up the spreadsheet. I'm also a little confused about the
tip rail measurement (it's different from the radial spreadsheet)  
  
For ratio = 5, opening =.067, tip rail = 1.5mm, a radial facing with "zero
point" of 50.3, and an elliptical facing with "zero point" of 50.5 yield:

Try inputting a ratio=1 in your elliptical calcs to see if the numbers match your radial calcs.

Keith,

When I use the spreadsheet for elliptical curves, I get target numbers that are nearly indistinguishable from radial numbers.  With a small tip opening, they only differ by .1 or .2 on the gauge (the difference is larger with a larger tip opening).  These are pretty close to the margin of error in refacing.  Am I getting something wrong here?  I did some cutting and pasting, so maybe I screwed up the spreadsheet.  I&#39;m also a little confused about the tip rail measurement (it&#39;s different from the radial spreadsheet)

For ratio = 5, opening =.067, tip rail = 1.5mm, a radial facing with "zero point" of 50.3, and an elliptical facing with "zero point" of 50.5 yield:

Feeler     Radial     Elliptical
.0015        43.0         43.1
.005          36.9         36.9
.010          31.4         31.3
.016          26.4         26.3
.024          21.0         20.9
.035          15.0         14.8
.050             8.1           8.0

Thanks.
