            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Bob - Happily, the inner cardboard tube says the above. It was used on  me 
in the hospital, and I have been happy I "stole"  the 1/2 roll left  over, 
prob it. would have been trashed.  It is non-tasting,  non-toxic  I&#39;m sure, 
quite elastic, don&#39;t know how it will stand up to teeth.  I vary  from double to 
single lip, depending on the character of the music, and my  feelings, I guess, 
scarsely [sp?] noticing it !!  Luck, Regards,  Don
