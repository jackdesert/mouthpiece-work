            <pre class='message__body'>+1 to this.  I also agree with Keith that the holes are unnecessary and
likely offer little additional strength.  Particularly in something the
size of the tip of an alto mouthpiece.

A warning about BPA would be responsible.  Although it seems people have no
problem consuming factory produced meats and milk, HFCS, soy, etc.
habitually.

Phil Barone used to drill small holes through the top of the mouthpiece
when replacing a biteplate and adding a baffle insert to metal Links.  They
were essentially anchored to each other and I&#39;ve seen a few in quite good
condition 25+ years later.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for all the tips. I think I&#39;ll go the simple route without  the drilling.  GW&#39;s  comment that it seemed too much like microsurgery struck a chord.. I have repaired a clarinet tenon by drilling holes through  the broken off piece and inserting pins, but  a mouthpiece is not going to experience the stress that  a tenon joint   goes through every time the instrument is assembled.
   It seems to me that if a repaired mouthpiece were dropped or banged against something it could just as likely break it a new place rather than at the repair line.
  In any case I admire the skill of someone who could do a repair by drilling holes in each  piece.  Peter</pre>
