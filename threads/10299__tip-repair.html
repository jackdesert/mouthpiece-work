Whatever adhesive you use, I&#39;d drill small anchor holes in the mouthpiece and the tip piece (if possible).

            <pre class='message__body'>All the tips I have reattached just seemed too small to me to consider drilling holes in them.  But I think the real reason I have not tried it is that it is an unnecessary step.  If I had a history of tip repairs falling off I would look into drilling, pins, whatever, but that is not the case.
 
For tight fitting breaks I use a gel CY glue.  But most of the time I use JB Weld since it fills gaps better.  If the tip is missing, I just rebuild the missing area with JB Weld, no hole drilling.  [I do plan to warn clients about potential BPA heath hazards.]

Sure.  Quite a few times, whether reattaching the broken piece or reforming a new piece completely.  I last did it on an $800 vintage Meyer bari mouthpiece that had the corner of the tip knocked off.  The careless owner was thrilled and is still happily playing on it one year later.  I&#39;m surprised anyone would consider doing it any other way, actually, once you consider the added mechanical strength it provides.  How do you do it?

            <pre class='message__body'>+1 to this.  I also agree with Keith that the holes are unnecessary and
likely offer little additional strength.  Particularly in something the
size of the tip of an alto mouthpiece.

A warning about BPA would be responsible.  Although it seems people have no
problem consuming factory produced meats and milk, HFCS, soy, etc.
habitually.

Phil Barone used to drill small holes through the top of the mouthpiece
when replacing a biteplate and adding a baffle insert to metal Links.  They
were essentially anchored to each other and I&#39;ve seen a few in quite good
condition 25+ years later.

+1 to this.  I also agree with Keith that the holes are unnecessary and likely offer little additional strength.  Particularly in something the size of the tip of an alto mouthpiece.
