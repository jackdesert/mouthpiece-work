            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone know where to go to get facing specs on mouthpieces that
are not shown in the typical charts?  For example; if I look at the
chart from Jody Jazz, or any other site that I have found, they do not
show the sizes for a Penzell - Mueller, Vito, H. Pourcelle.  Nor do
they show the specified opening size for a Selmer "C"; only a C*.

Thank you,

David

            <pre class='message__body'>You may find some tip openings in the Woodwind and brasswind catalog.

This is an area where we could improve the group&#39;s reference files if 
we pool our resources.  I have been measuring and recording facing 
specs for over 7 years, mostly in the Eric Brand format.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Eric Brand book, discussed in another recent thread, mentions that 
his refacing kit comes with a list of mouthpiece facing specs.  Given 
that the book is old, the specs would also be old, but does anybody 
have a copy of this information?

            <pre class='message__body'>Ralph Morgan also published these specs in a Sax Journal column several
years ago.  The back issue is probably still available.  I have it
somewhere.

It was not the holy grail of information you think it would be.  It was all
really closed facings from the 40&#39;s or so.  I plotted a few of the curves
and several did not look good.  Could be some typos or they were just taken
off a MP selected at random.  I compared a couple of the curves to some
new-looking vintage mouthpiece that I measured and they did not compare
well.

You will do better to copy the facing curve off a mouthpiece that plays
well for you or use a spreadsheet to calculate your own targets.
