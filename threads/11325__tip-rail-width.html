            <pre class='message__body'>Hi to all , 
i have just started learning to measure my mouthpieces
facing curves - so i am a total newbe , 
so please bear with me ;)

I am trying to use a spreadsheet downloaded from the files part of this great 
MouthpieceWork Group - for examle AD&#39;s Eliptical Facing Mark II 

so far i have been able to measure the facing curve using sat of feeler gauges, 
tip opening using digital caliper , 
but still don&#39;t know how to properly measure a tip rail width ?

thanks in advance for any advices

Dimitri

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a set of calipers and a ~6X magnifier used to do linen thread counts.

Some guys just use a ball park number or use zero and measure the tip opening at the very tip of the mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Thank you for your reply , So its not very crutial to use the correct Tip rail
width for the facibg curve plot? What's a good "ballpark" number to use than
Or just a using a.. zero? Other question is : I've noticed that my old vintage
mluthpieces All have one side of the facing longer than the other .especially
at the 0.0015 feeler gauge ( maybe due to worn facing) If the curve seriously
crocked or longer on one side...do I have to dial in both sides ( left n
right) measures into the spreadsheet ? Sorry for maybe a very basic question.

            <pre class='message__body'>You can try and measure the tip rail widths on your favorite mouthpieces and use that.  .022" might be typical.
 
Average the left and right readings.  You can modify a spreadsheet so that you can enter a reading for the left and right rails and let the spreadsheet do the averaging.  If you can not do this, then I do not think you should be using a spreadsheet until you learn some basic editting skills.

            <pre class='message__body'>It depends where you measure the tip opening from.  If you measure it from the very front of the mouthpiece, use zero as your tip rail width.  If you measure the tip opening from the inner edge of the tip rail, then you should also measure the tip rail width and input that number into the spreadsheet.  This is what I do since I find it easier to measure the tip opening at that point.
