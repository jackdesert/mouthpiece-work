Any suggestion is appreciated....

            <pre class='message__body'>Do you have a picture you can post?   Usually you can just reface it to get
it out.  But on larger dinks, you need to rough it in first by bending it
back.  I just press it by hand on a hard metal surface like what is found
on the back of most bench vises.

            <pre class='message__body'>Same thing I do with bent links, though most of the ones I&#39;ve dealt 
with have had the tip bent down. I&#39;ve also used heat to bend back 
plastic Lakeys.
