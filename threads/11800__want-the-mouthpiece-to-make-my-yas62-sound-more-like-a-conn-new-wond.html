            <pre class='message__body'>First, get some temporary putty and make a small baffle for your current mouthpiece.  I like using poster mounting putty for this as it comes out real clean.  Dental wax, clay, Play-Doh, Silly Putty, etc can be used.  You just may need a little soap and water (don&#39;t use hot water) to clean out the residue.

Try smearing a thin layer on your current baffle and play test it.  Try a few other shapes you have seen in other mouthpieces.  Arches, humps, wedges.  If you find something you like, it can be made more permanent using an epoxy putty.  Or, you can shop for another mouthpiece that has the features you like.

I mostly play an S80 with a baffle insert on tenor sax. A baffle
insert will definitely brighten your sound; and also increases the
energy efficiency of a mouthpiece-reed combination: plays louder with
less wind. 

My preference is to grind a shape that fits tightly in the
chamber, using a piece of white PVC pipe, and shaping it at a grinding
wheel. A flat wedge with a slanted leading edge, after the style of a
Runyon baffle insert, works well for me. "Spoiler" isn&#39;t necessary. This
will stay in if fitted properly, but can always be popped out. 

Some of
the synthetic reeds are quite bright-sounding. I&#39;ve been happily playing
some Bari synthetic reeds (however these have needed massive
re-profiling to play well), also the Hartman Fiberreeds are quite
bright. Compared to cane, they also feel more efficient, that is to say
they play louder, more easily, and easier top tones. 

Lastly, and you
may be hesitant about this - taking off a little baffle just behind the
tip rail will brighten and free up an S80. It will be less stuffy. I
have a pair I use, and have done this on both - a teeny bit at a time,
but a few times.
