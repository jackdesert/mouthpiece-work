            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everybody,

I&#39;ve succesfully modelled a mouthpiece in 3d (solidworks) and succesfully 3d printed one. now I&#39;m reviewing prototype "KB1" I&#39;m not satisfied with the tip shape, I want it to be the same a reed.

But the tip shape of a reed is allmost impossible to measure! 

so that concludes me to my question; has anyone accurate dimensions of a reed? maybe Mojo as he has the metal reeds, are they lasercut or handmade? in the first case there have to be known dimensions.

I hope you can help,

Kind Regards,

Koen

I scanned a Rico tenor reed on 2D scanner.
I saved the reed as tiff file... that&#39;s funny!
I imported the tiff file on AutoCad and then I drew the tip over the image.
So I got a CAD drawing of the tip.

Then you can import that drawing into a 3D cad...
