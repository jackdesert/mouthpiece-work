            <pre class='message__body'>I have truly enjoyed the great technical discussion about saxophone acoustics that has been taking place on various Yahoo groups recently. This is a subject near and dear to my heart, and I would like to encourage it and see it flourish.

I have been contacted today by several members of my saxophone repair group who have expressed concern that this discussion is taking our groups too far away from their stated purpose and the discussion has begun to be dominated by this topic alone. I can see that point. 

In order to keep existing groups on their stated original topic and at the same time encourage the discussion of saxophone acoustics, I have established a group (URL in the title of this post) for the express purpose of providing a venue dedicated to the subject of saxophone acvoustics, and would encourage those who are interested to join this moderated group
