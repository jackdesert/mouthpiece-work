First is this really an alto piece? IF this is about 3 3/8" where it 
is a little longer than an alto and shorter than a tenor. It might be 
a C Melody piece.  If it is a C Melody piece, my guess is that it is a 
Holton C Melody piece that I think went with the Rudy Wiedoeft model 
Holton (not Henton, which is something different) C Melody.  Those 
pieces are sorta red bakelite with the metal insert. It usually says 
Holton on the back and had the inscriptions on the shank ring like 
what is on the pictures.

Henton and Sil-va-lay also made these kind of hybrid bakelite/metal 
pieces.

That&#39;s my guess from what I see in the pictures...

            <pre class='message__body'>Folks,

I found an old hard rubber tenor piece in a music store&#39;s junk bin. 
The rubber looked nice so I grabbed it.

It seems to have no markings on it except "J5W" is stamped at the
bottom of the table.

It looks to have considerable hand finishing on it.  It&#39;s awfully
close for me, so I don&#39;t really know how well it plays  (I&#39;ll have to
find a harder reed).

Anyone have an idea what this might be??

Thanks,

M.
