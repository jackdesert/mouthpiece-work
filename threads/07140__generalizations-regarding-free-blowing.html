            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John. In my opinion, first generally found a general concept:
- First at all one Vandoren reed is nearly one 15% more endure than other marks of reeds. Sino more.
- For this reed endure the tip opening be able a 18 to 23 mms.
- The curve ramp (i here say "Perfil Curvo" or "Curve profile") can
be variable and depend of the player mouth. My preference is that the starting point be able the more progresive possible. To middle of curve determine a perfect radial curve to the tip.
- Facing length (for me "largo de la curva") from 18 (36) to 20 (40) no more. 
Important: All this can not prove serve in all instance because one must do it first at the minimal size to and fro. Proof and error, for me not fail!
Then, of that serve explain oneself that much?...if when the player play nothing happen or the baffle is very plane (or high) with one non resistance details in the tip, in the rear window, walls, etc. The Java reed is a Jazz reed for me. Good timbre, sharp and expresiveness,especially with jazz mouthpiece. My preference, the V16 metal mouthpiece vintage model 1965 with a common bracket, for tenor sax, very good.

Fraternally....Silverio

I am have experience with the Excel spreadsheet, how i can formulate for to have major precision graphic chart?

From my experience, these things make a piece less resistant:
Radial facing curve.
Longer facing (larger curve radius).
smaller tip opening.
higher baffle.

Exactly what is going to match a java 3 1/2 depends on just how much resistance you want the piece to have and what kind of sound.

Thanks Silverio,   With the tip open opening 18-23mm...I assume you mean 1.8 and 2.3mm.     Also is your statement about spreadsheet stating that you need help?
Your point about making sure you have a perfect radial curve from the middle of the curve to the tip is interesting.    I have just elongated an alto mouthpiece to a 47mm facing length in a rough fashion.  I didn&#39;t touch anything else.  It really didn&#39;t add any resistance and didn&#39;t make things worse.  I note that the selmer alto cstar mouthpieces had a .866 facing length... or 44 erick b.   Such a popular mouthpiece....was this a radial curve?

-Hi Keith, What would you do for a more closed facing....say .073 on alto. thanks John

If the client wanted it as free-blowing as possible, again a radial facing and a long facing curve.  I would not normally do this for a .073" tip unless requested to do it.  I would normally use a 42-44 facing length and some elliptical shape to the facing curve.  I think it articulates and responds better across the entire range.  If it blows too resistant with a 3.5 a 3 would be nice lively sound on it.

On radial curve radius choice: once you pick a tip opening and facing length, there is only one radius that will pass through both these points and be tangent to the table.

Elliptical curves.....where would I find these?  Nothing in the files section.    thanks  John

I think Silverio means 18-23 mm facing length -- 36-46 on the gauge.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry john, i mean 1,8 and 2,3 mm. is correct.
Respect de perfect radial question, for me isn&#39;t practically possible because i haven&#39;t apparatus technologically necessary for work in this way. Scarcely i can to draw a profile of such curve and compare visually.
Relating to 4,7 of the lenght curve, all is possible; but i will have some reserve to respect. Yes, that is the recommendation; but, why begin with such size? Are there margin for errors?

Referent to standard mouthp. my opinion with 22 (44) of total lenght,
that is very common but difficult a radial curve. I believe that curves of facing (curve profile, perfil curvo) are a combination of three lines: straigh, oval and radial, as combine us.

The Excel spreadsheet isn&#39;t a secret for me, but i will like have the correct formulas for control and statistic. 

Fraternally....Silverio

Nothing?  Look in the Files - Methods section.  See "AD&#39;s Elliptical Facing.xls".  

I have a Power Point presentation on my site that illustrates the facing formulas.   www.mojomouthpiecework.com

I share a lot but I prefer to keep my personal facing spreadsheet to myself.
