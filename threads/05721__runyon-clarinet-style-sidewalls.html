 Something like a link does not do this.  Perhaps this narrowing
allows the cross sectional area of the Runyon/clarinet mouthpiece to
remain constant as the roof rises until the chamber is reached.

Are there any sound or response generalizations that can be made about
this style of sidewall narrowing compared to a traditional sidewall
transition?  Except for Runyon I don&#39;t recall seeing much of this.

  But it also allows withdrawal of the core dies (that form the bore and chamber) after the plastic is injected into the mold.
   
  Sound is very focused, that is, a good "core" to the tone, not a spread tone.

Actually, I would say this sidewall taper is more commonly found than not
in sax mouthpieces.  Soundwise they give more focus to the sound.  But I
think the main reason for it is that it is easier to mass produce a
mouthpiece this way.  It just happens to be a good design.  It is an
improvement over Adolphs original concept.
