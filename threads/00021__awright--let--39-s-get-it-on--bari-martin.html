            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks, Mojo! I don&#39;t mess around with facings too much, but I do a 
lot of other stuff to mpcs that may interest someone. I&#39;ll post more 
later. Right now I&#39;m taking a look at a Dukoff that my bari player 
uses on tenor. He had to stop using it because it squeaked so bad, so 
I&#39;m going to clean it up and try it out. It&#39;s a D8 and should be a 
screamer. He&#39;s using a Brilhart Level Air (original) that I got for 
him because he also plays one on bari, but it sounds like crap on his 
tenor. If I find that the facing is crooked or the tip baffle needs 
work, I&#39;ll send it to Jon or Theo.
