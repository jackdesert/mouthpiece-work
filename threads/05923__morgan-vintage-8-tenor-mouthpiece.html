            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I described in a recent post the behaviour of this piece.
It has a well balanced tone at lowish pressure levels but as soon as I push more air
through the sound becomes unpleasantly thinnish, bright and nasal.
I&#39;ve just had a closer look and am wondering if someone has had a go at refacing,
About 5mm from the tip end of the rails I can see a "sudden" bend, as though someone may 
have tried to increase the lay.
In other words the rails don&#39;t smoothly curve right to the tip of the piece. This is fairly subtle; 
only visible in the right light. 
The baffle is very similar to that of my 8* metal Link.

Regards,
David
