This may sound a bit crass, but I would personally rather hear about Steve Goodson&#39;s new Mouthpieces than the 100th post about Mouthpiece feeler gauges. Otherwise, keep up the great work Mojobari, I love your site. Cheers.
Michael Semann.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your comments.  Just realize that this site is about (virtually)
unlimited posts on mouthpiece work and its tools.  We welcome more posts on
feeler gauges.  There are plenty of other sites that focus on other sax topics.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith - In my opinion, your original note suggesting that we exercise 
patience, good judgment, and broad-mindedness was very much on target.  Most of us 
are probably players and instrument techs (to one degree or another) in addition 
to our interest in mouthpieces.

Thanks for creating and maintaining a great site!
