            <pre class='message__body'>Help me please.  I have an unmarked hard rubber alto piece that I would like to identify.  It looks like an old Meyer or old Bundy and has a "2" stamped on the table.  It has a shank crack and when I started sanding the shank in preparation of banding, the rubber dust was lavender.  I remember reading about the sweet smell of some sanded old HR.  This smells a little sweet, but the color is vibrant.

Has anyone had this purple haze-ish experience?

            <pre class='message__body'>Purple dust usually indicates it is made of plastic.  Hard rubber would yield brown dust.

            <pre class='message__body'>That is my experience, too.  A mouthpiece I worked on that was KNOWN to be plastic yielded purple dust that smelled odd and slightly sweet.  Hard rubber dust is brown and smells of sulphur.

            <pre class='message__body'>I guess it must be plastic, but I&#39;ve never seen plastic, tonalin, ebolin, etc that looks and feels like rubber.  I have worked on many HR pieces and this one didn&#39;t have any oxidation.  This one had me fooled because it tools and feels like hard rubber.  

Thanks
