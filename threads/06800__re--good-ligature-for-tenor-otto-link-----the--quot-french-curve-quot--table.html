            <pre class='message__body'>This is a good lead-in to a discussion.  
 
In the May/June 2009 issue of the Saxophone Journal, Wolf(e) Taninbaum wrote and article on Mouthpiece Design.  It is basically a "dump" of what he thinks about mouthpiece design.  
 
One of the points he makes is the French (concave) table is intentionally used by Babbitt, Vandoren and Bari.  He includes a sketch that shows the low spot to be .0015".  This concave table puts the reed "in a pocket" as per his description.  What he shows in the sketch is a hidden line indicating that this concavity is one that some might think of using to allow for reed swell.  It shows the sides of the table straight and the concavity in the middle of the table.
 
My observation of Babbitt mouthpieces is that this is not what they are using.  They hav a concavity that goes all the way across the table.  The ligature is then tightened to bow the reed into this concave table.  Also, the Babbitt STM Link concavity is on the order .003".
 
Maybe WT was trying to show the Babbitt concavity.  In his discussion he mentions that the ligature bows the reed.  
 
Anyone else have a take on this article?

How would one machine this concavity?  Certainly no one thinks that this is done by hand on each mouthpiece?

I don&#39;t think it is.  I think it is shrinkage after the heat produced by cutting the table, an accident of the production process.

            <pre class='message__body'>Speaking as someone involved in the mouthpiece manufacturing business, I
agree with Paul...I think the phenomenon is common, but not intentional..I
see it all the time, and it&#39;s not absolutely consistent, leading  me to

I personally feel that bowing the reed with the ligature is undesirable for two reasons. It means the reed may not return to its previous setting each time it is removed, altering the response.

Also, bowing is surely going to restrict the free vibration along the reeds length.

I am about to flatten the table on a cheap plastic MPC. This &#39;French&#39;  curve seems common on these mass produced items. It also has a noticeable upward curve at the butt end.
I&#39;ve no doubt the reed and I will feel all the better for it!

I seem to have developed a trigger finger, and this is having an impact on my playing of the violin and flute (left index finger). Hasn&#39;t bothered my clarinet playing yet, but I&#39;m thinking it might.

Has anyone dealt with this issue before?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d avoid the steroid injection and rest as much as possible first.  if you
are a pro and have to play, you may not have a choice, but if you don&#39;t
absolutely have to play, take the time to rest.  Make sure your instrument
is sealing properly, because in my case, I am sure my trigger thumb resulted
from pressing too hard on keys that were not seating properly.  Steroids did
not help me, but eucalyptus oil and rest did.  I have had no further
problems and I am very conscientious about avoiding muscle tension while
playing. Good luck. John

            <pre class='message__body'>Fred and John, thanks for the replies.

I think the root of my problem was the same as yours, John,  pressing too hard while learning, and the doggone thing was leaking all along. 

I think I&#39;d like to try the eucalyptus oil first, can you give me some specific info? 

thanks
