            <pre class='message__body'>hello to all,
I have a Tenor Selmer Soloist G (without "soloist" engraved on the table - &#39;70 years?). It has very uneven side rails and 210 mm - 083 tip opening. I would reface it with its "original" curve.
In  Selmer site I have seen that for tenor Soloist (current production) max tip opening  is F (250 mm - 24 mm facing length).
Anyone could  show me facing length and tip opening for this moutpiece?
thanks in advance, this group is great!!!!!
ciao a tutti Filippo</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>The Links area on the Mouthpiece Work site has a Selmer link. It 
lists for tenor G: 2.50mm tip and 24.00mm facing length.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Selmer facings are .004" or 0.1mm increments, or for the larger 
sizes, 0.2 mm increments.

 

My charts show, for tenor

 

C* = .071" or 1.8 mm

C**= .075" or 1.9 mm

D = .078" or 2.0 mm

E = .082" or 2.1 mm

F = .090" or 2.3 mm

G = .098" or 2.5 mm

 

This chart is for the 1960&#39;s -1970&#39;s Selmer Soloist Tenors.

 

24 mm facing length is excellent for tenor sax.  This is measured with 
the .0015" feeler (0.04 mm) gauge.  The next reading would be the .010" 
gauge (0.25 mm).  There should be about 5 mm difference between the 
.0015" and .010" feeler gauges.  So, if the .0015" (0.04 mm) reads 24 
mm, the .010" (0.25mm) should have a reading of about 19 mm.

 

Selmer  mouthpieces are notorious for having warped facings, uneven side 
rails, and facing lengths and tip openings nowhere near where their 
charts indicate.  I have begun to think that they stamp the facing sizes 
on at random.
