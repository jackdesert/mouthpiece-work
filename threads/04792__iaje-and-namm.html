            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ll be appearing at the IAJE in New York and the NAMM show in Anaheim over
the next couple of weeks (along with some dealer appearances) and would very
much like to meet any members of this
list who are participating in those shows. I&#39;ll be at the Orpheus Music
booth for the entire run of both shows. I&#39;ll have examples of all
of my new horn designs, my new line of aftermarket necks, and
my new line of mouthpieces with me for you to try.

The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
