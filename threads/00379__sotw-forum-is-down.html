Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s OK, things will be better.  SOTW forum will come back
up sooner or later, and you can get you daily "fix" of SOTW discussion.
You will survive.

(Peggy says, yes, but will I survive?)

Harri did send out an e-mail to a bunch of folks.  I guess not everyone
got
it (please send out to your list).  I noticed that around 5pm (Arizona
time)
yesterday that the &#39;site went down.  It seems like eesites/Swirve is
having
a problem: the other Forums they host are also down.

I can ping the server, so there&#39;s hope.

Harri is looking into the problems and Zman has also been notified.  I
can
say that I also have a backup of the entire forum from 8-4-02, so even
if
we&#39;re completely dead, it won&#39;t be for long -- we might need a new Forum

provider, though.

Take care!
Pete
