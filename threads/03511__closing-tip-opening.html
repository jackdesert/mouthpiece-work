            <pre class='message__body'>Greetings, all - I am working on closing down the tip opening on a mouthpiece 
that was previously worked on by someone else.

It looks as if changing the pitch of the table from shank to tip will help a 
great deal, but I seem to remember having read in these posts that changing 
the pitch of the table is a "no-no."

What the best procedure?  I want to go from .098 to .090.

Thanks in advance,
Dan Marsteller

            <pre class='message__body'>If the table isn&#39;t flat you could easily end up there.  Granted you will have to rework the facing curve.  Do you have enough material to work with by taking the table down?

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know whether I have enough thickness in the table (.050).  Would 
taking .008 make the table too thin?  It would lengthen the window and shorten the 
facing, so I&#39;m assuming that I will need to compenstate for those changes as 
well.

Thanks for the input, Ed.

            <pre class='message__body'>No, you have plenty of material in the table to close it down.  The hard
part is keeping the table flat.  You can bias you table cutting as if
angling it, but it is not as important as keeping th table flat.  If you
lean too hard trying to angle it, often you will get a convex table.

The window can be lengthened some without significant effect.
