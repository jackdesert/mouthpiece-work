            <pre class='message__body'>I just posted three pictures in the Photos, Chamber Work folder.

Fist is the packaging from two brands of epoxy putty I picked up 
recently at Walmart.  Both epoxy putties have about 4 to 5 minutes of 
working time, and are fairly hard in 15 minutes.  I don&#39;t recommend 
filing on them until waiting 45 minutes to an hour, otherwise it will 
foul your file.

First is by QuickSteel by Cargo, 1304 F.M. 3083, Conroe, Texas 77303, 
part number 16002.  This is good stuff for our purposes because it is 
black, and will make very professional looking baffles in black 
plastic and hard rubber mouthpieces.  The color is a very good match.

The second one is by Loctite, distributed by Manco, Inc., 32150 Just 
Imagine Dr., Avon, OH 44011, part number 81512.  In the tube the 
outer part appears to be dark blue, and the inner part is white.  It 
kneads to a very light gray color, and is what I used to do a better 
chamber and baffle in the NY Link pictured.

I received two Links from a fellow to try to get them to play well.  
The Babbit made Link just needed the table flattened, and some light 
facing work, and was returned to the player.

The other "NY Link" was a problem piece.  The facing was very 
obviously machined about 10 degrees off, compared to the casting, as 
if the blank were placed twisted in the facing machine.  You could 
see where the baffle was filed to attempt to blend it into the tip 
rail.  Not only was the table not square to the mouthpiece, the 
facing had a slight twist.  This was quite a surprise, as "NY Links" 
and "FL Links" are sought after by players who think they are better 
than the current Babbit made Links.  Well, the current Links I have 
seen were much better made than this particular piece, which should 
have found its way into the trash heap instead of being sent off to 
the platers, then sold.  Babbit does a much better job, I think.

OK, back to the crooked piece.  The first mouthpiece works well as a 
good jazz combo piece, with its big chamber and dark, smooth tone.  
So, after discussing it with the player, we decided to make a new 
chamber and baffle for the crooked one, and this would be more of an 
R&B piece.

I filled in the concave sidewalls, and made a new long, curved 
baffle.  I used the Loctite epoxy putty, and brought it all the way 
up to the tip rail.  

I did not do any facing work first, just the chamber work.  I did 
this so as to be square with the table, ignoring the body of the 
piece.  THEN I flattened the table and worked the facing all the way 
out to the tip to have even side rails.  Finally, I filed the baffle 
and smoothed it into the tip rail.  You can see more brass on one 
side than the other, but it is the mouthpiece that is crooked, not 
the final result.  

Now this piece has a nice, tight core to the tone, and is rich in 
overtones.  The altissimo is also better.  This one would do well for 
some honkin big band work (Kenton, Woody Herman, etc), or some Rock & 
Roll.  I think the customer will be happy with this.

I know, the photos are fuzzy... my camera work is not up to my sax 
work... hah!

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the info, Paul. I&#39;ve never run across any epoxy that was not gray or a strange green color. 
 
Everything from this forum is so helpful. I just wish it had been around twenty years ago!
