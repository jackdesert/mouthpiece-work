In the seventies I owned a MkVI Tenor with a Berg Larson
mouthpiece. Now it was stolen and I cannot remember what the
Berg Larson model was. I hope someone can help me ? The
mpc was of black rubber with a brass colored ligature and reed
cover, The lay was big, but the body of it was quite narrow. Could
someone suggest what model it was or perhaps what models
were produced in the 1970&#39;s.

Sorry to hear about your loss. Hope it was only the mouthpiece and 
not the saxophone. As a fellow South African I know how hard it is to 
find a replacement since our market is so small.

The description sounds like a early 70&#39;s Berg which should be possible
to replace. Do you have a idea of how big the lay was ?
 
I own more than 50 tenor mouthpieces which include 3 rubber bergs 
from different periods. Various Berg metal as well.

I also made 9 tenor mouthpieces including 5 which is very simillar to
the Bergs of the late 60&#39;s early 70&#39;s ... Funny enough these 5
mouthpieces are my favourites which I prefer above any other 
mouthpiece I have ever played !  My problem is which one to make my 
number 1 ...

I have met you before in Marshall Music but lost your bussiness card
recently. You can contact me at 082-7141498  or 016-9814294 .
I live in Vanderbijlpark and would like to get you to try my 
mouthpieces.

I also have great alto + soprano mouthpieces . Even
made 10 soprano and 2 alto mouthpieces (I like them all) but since I 
only know good tenor players I need somebody other than me to 
evaluate the alto and soprano mouthpieces.

Wish you success in your search
