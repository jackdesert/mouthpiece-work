Selmer F tip opening is .057", which is 1.45 mm.

 

I have no idea what Selmer&#39;s facing length is supposed to be.  Their
mouthpieces are not consistent.  But I would suggest 

 

17 mm (34 on E Brand) for the .0015" feeler (0.04 mm)

12 mm (24 on E Brand) for the .010" feeler  (0.25 mm) 

 

and a radial curve on to the tip.

Helge, for a 20 mm facing, the first feeler .0015" (0.04 mm) would be 20 mm
from the tip.

 

The next feeler, 0.010" (0.25 mm) would be 15 mm from the tip.  

 

The rest would be a radial curve to the .057" (1.45 mm) tip opening.

This is interesting - a completely radial curve with a .057" tip and a .010
reading of 30 (15mm) would continue on to a .0015 reading of 42.6 (21.3mm).
Following a suggestion of yours, I have often gone for a radial facing on
alto, tenor, and bari pieces, and then _lengthened_ the "back" end (.0015 and
.005 feelers). This soprano facing schedule would have a _shorter_.0015
reading than radial (40 vs 42.6). Is this a facing schedule that you have just
found works well empirically, or is there some general principle behind this
shorter back-end for a soprano facing?

several mouthpieces that played very well but didn't appear to have a radial

the tip back to the .010 feeler or so).

            <pre class='message__body'>With a radial curve there is no sudden change the reed must comply with as it closes.  It smoothly wraps around the curve.  
   
  Of course, this makes more of a difference the larger the tip opening, such as used with saxophones.  
   
  Clarinets, with much closer tip openings, seem to work OK with some pretty angular facings, where the facing is really just an angle to the table, with a little radius at the break.  Since the reed does not have to deflect very far to close, this can work for clarinet.
   
  For such a facing, with "kinks" to have to wrap around, to work for saxophone the reed has to be very compliant, or soft, to do that.
   
  Deviating from that radial curve at the break, which is seen as lengthening the first two feeler readings, acts as an "easement" into the curve and often improves the low end response without harming the high end.

            <pre class='message__body'>Another curve that works well on soprano (and alto) for me is the
elliptical curve with a ratio of around 4.5.  I got this idea from a
Vandoren alto piece I measured some time back, and some comments Keith
B made.  This geometry provides what Paul describes below: an easing
of the low notes because the curve starts off more gradual than a
radial curve.  It also provides a bit more resistance and "hold" for
the palm key notes and improves intonation overall, since the curve is
a little steeper just before it gets to the tip.  There is a
spreadsheet I posted in the Files section that allows you to calculate
the curve.  Worth a try.

Regards,
Andrew

a radial facing on alto, tenor, and bari pieces, and then lengthened
the "back" end (.0015 and .005 feelers).  This soprano facing schedule
would have a shorter .0015 reading than radial (40 vs 42.6).  Is this
a facing schedule that you have just found works well empirically, or
is there some general principle behind this shorter back-end for a
soprano facing?

            <pre class='message__body'>> Hi.
I recently bought a Morgan Vintage mouthpiece for Tenor off eBay. It  
has a pleasing tone when played at low to medium levels but as soon  
as it&#39;s pushed petty hard it becomes quite thin, bright and nasal  
around low "E".
What should I do to the mouthpiece to improve this? The mouthpiece  
has a Link style roll over.

Regards,
David

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Keith&#39;s recennt posting may apply to this 
mouthpiece question: 

"When I gun sight along the baffle from the tip, I like to 
be able to see at least 1/2 of the bore opening. Any 
higher and I feel it chokes off the sound some. Seeing the 
whole bore is a good target."

This is a very nice rule of thumb, by the way, thanks 
Keith.

In other words, the baffle can&#39;t be too high just behind 
the tip.

Take a look at last week&#39;s postings about forming a tip 
rail: Paul&#39;s description about how he adjusts the baffle 
behind the tip rail is especially useful.

If this adjustment is what is required, the improvement is 
quite remarkable, but I&#39;ve had the unhappy experience of 
hoping to get "a little more" and instead hitting a point 
of diminishing returns.
