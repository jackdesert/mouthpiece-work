Hi Lance, if you follow this link you will come to Shcønberger Ebonite
Manufacture. They sell rods of Ebonite in different diameter for mouthpiece
blanks in very good quality. Berg Larsen and Otto Link are among mouthpieces
made of their ebonite.  You can order for one mouthpiece or as many as you
want.  

A happy new year to you, and all the other members of this group J 

 

Best Helge

As someone interested in experimenting with building mpcs, I was wondering
if any of the knowledgeable techs out there, know of a source for hard
rubber blanks or rods. Particularly anyone willing to sell relatively small
amounts, at least to start with. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Let me point out that Delrin has a VERY similar flex modulus to hard rubber.  (Flex modulus, how it vibrates)  It is a great material to work with, machine, or face, and has excellent durability.

Even if you intend to manufacture mouthpieces from hard rubber, it would be wise to make experimental prototypes from Delrin, at least to see if you have your machine set up right.

Also, Delrin is known generically as Acetal.  You can buy rods of Acetal or branded Delrin from Smallparts.com in both black and white.

This is a good point. Acetal is much better for prototyping than hard rubber.  It&#39;s cheaper, and you can cut much faster and dry.  Wears cutter much more slowly as well.  From start to finish a delrin piece costs something like 1/4 to 1/3 what a rubber one does to produce.  I don&#39;t like working it by hand, but it is hard and stable enough to be entirely functional.
