            <pre class='message__body'>Hello to all
I am going to work on tenor Florida STM Link 7: this piece  makes stuffy some notes of cromatic scale (from concert gb at b in low octave and from eb at gb in second octave) on the owners horns, two mark 6 and one SBA (all in perfect conditions about leaks and key height). This problem is not noticeable on my super action II.
What are the faults (in the facing curve or in the interior) that might cause uneveness in tone of cromatic scale?
thanks
ciao a tutti Filippo </pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>I have not played with facing curves in an effort to improve mid-
range notes.  If correcting a curve to a more radial arc shape does 
not do it for a client, I will try some baffle changes.  Adding 
baffle near the tip mostly effects high notes.  Going farther away 
from the tip adds brightness to mid-range, then lower notes.  Use 
some temporary putty to see if you can find some spots in the mid-
baffle area to help you.
