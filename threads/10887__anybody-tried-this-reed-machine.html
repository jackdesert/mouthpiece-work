            <pre class='message__body'>I have used a Reedual for 30 years with varied success.  The builder of the Reedual passed away in the last year and I am not sure if they will continue.  http://www.uhl-technik.de/en/index.html is a German company which makes a reed machine that is quite good, but expensive.  I have used both machines and the UHL design is much more accurate.  That said, I can buy a boat load of reeds for the cost of a machine.
