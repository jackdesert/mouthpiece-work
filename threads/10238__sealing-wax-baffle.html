            <pre class='message__body'>You may have covered this before (I tried searching but got tired after viewing 1000 posts), I am playing with adding wax baffles to mouthpieces. I am trying wax because I do not feel confident enough to use epoxy and also want to experiment with different sizes, shapes, etc.

Anyway, what can I use to seal the wax afterward so the wax wont lose its shape over time?

            <pre class='message__body'>If you are happy with a shape and want to preserve it, you will be best served by simply duplicating it in epoxy....I am not sure there is a good way to guarantee that a wax baffle will adhere to a mouthpiece on a long term basis

            <pre class='message__body'>Some waxes are extremely hard and won&#39;t need sealing. Old fashioned sealing
wax comes to mind, but your local craft shop may be able to help. You could
try Blue tack.
