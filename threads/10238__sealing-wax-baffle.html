You may have covered this before (I tried searching but got tired after
viewing 1000 posts), I am playing with adding wax baffles to mouthpieces. I
am trying wax because I do not feel confident enough to use epoxy and also
want to experiment with different sizes, shapes, etc.

Anyway, what can I use to seal the wax afterward so the wax wont lose its
shape over time?
