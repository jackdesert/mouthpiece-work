I recently bought a couple of French HR bari blanks (IDEAL MP Co.) 
off eBay real cheap. They are nice rubber and the chamber is similar 
to the WW NY in the reed area but not quite so big in the 
throat...also thinking about what to do.

P.S. I would still be interested in trying some of your bari pieces 
next time you are in San Francisco...
