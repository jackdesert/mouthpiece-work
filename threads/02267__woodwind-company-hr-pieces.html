            <pre class='message__body'>I remember seeing an old post somewhere (but couldn&#39;t find it when I 
searched) where someone was seeking the old "Woodwind Company" 
mouthpieces.  I was sent a pristine (still in the package) Woodwind 
Educator baritone HR piece to reface and beef up.  Just wanted to 
make sure it isn&#39;t some sort of collector item before I ruin it&#39;s 
vintage status.  

Thanks in advance for any info.

I recently bought a couple of French HR bari blanks (IDEAL MP Co.) 
off eBay real cheap. They are nice rubber and the chamber is similar 
to the WW NY in the reed area but not quite so big in the 
throat...also thinking about what to do.

P.S. I would still be interested in trying some of your bari pieces 
next time you are in San Francisco...
