            <pre class='message__body'>For a new person getting started at this, it appears that there are
two easy ways to go -  the Winslow Kit or the Morgan Kit. I understand
the main difference is wand vs gauge but one thing not clear is the
difference between the printed instructions. I just got the Erick
Brand Repair Manual and am studing his refacing instructions.
So after that long setup, finally my question. Is there much
difference between the printed instructions of Winslow and Morgan? Is
one better written for the beginner or much longer with more detail? I
would think that an understanding of "how to do it" could make all the
difference.
Or, is it really more of an art and you just have to turn good
mouthpieces into paperweights until you "get it"? (probably like
eveything else, a combination of both).

            <pre class='message__body'>I have not seen the Morgan instructions.  The Winslow instructions 
are very basic.  I think the Erick Brand chapters are a little better 
and are adequate enough for a beginner.

Getting repeatable gauging results takes practice.  

Flattening a table can be maddening.  It keeps getting wider and 
wider as you try to fix your mistakes. 

Getting a feel for how many swipes you can do before gauging again 
takes practice.  It depends on the material hardness, rail thickness, 
the sandpaper grit, and your technique.  How to sand off a high spot 
without getting the perfect parts above and below it is tough.

I learned mostly from studying the various mouthpieces.  I had Jon 
Van Wie do a few of mine in the past and I studied what he did to 
them.  I have some old web postings of his describing some of the 
steps he does.

Be sure to check out the files area at the MP Work site.  There are 
some old Runyon articles there that Santy gave us permission to 
post.  Some parts are tough to read, but there is some good info 
there.

The alto mouthpiece paper by Larry Wyman is great (see the link in 
the Bookmarks area).  It gives you a feel for the effect of many 
other mouthpiece parameters besides facings.  It is very scientific 
without being overly complex.

            <pre class='message__body'>Mike:  I have the Eric Brand book and also own the Winslow kit.  Both
have good instructions.  I had looked at both kits, and based on the
recommendation of Santy Runyon, my good friend and mouthpiece
manufacturer, bought the Winslow kit (Madison Enterprises).  The only
thing I did not like was the file for the baffle, too large.  I was
given a smaller file by Lilly at Runyon, one like they use in their
production.  It is about �� wide, flat on one side, and rounded on the
other.  Similar files can be bought from MicroMark.  I also purchases a
�file card�, which is a type of brush for cleaning files, from Ferree�s.

The dial indicator and fixture supplied by Winslow for measuring tip
openings is, to me, superior to any wand gauge.

Winslow also supplies one each clarinet, alto, and tenor sax mouthpiece
for beginning work.  If you would write me at home, I would be glad to
send you jpg�s of the Winslow instructions.

I am sure no matter which kit you buy, Winslow, or Morgan, you will have
a good tools to begin.
