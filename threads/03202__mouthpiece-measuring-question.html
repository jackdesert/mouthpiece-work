Hi,

I don&#39;t know anything about mouthpiece refacing but I have a 
question.  I don&#39;t know whether or not there is a simple explanation 
for it.
 
I just got a new Meyer 7 and I am wondering if it is even and 
everything.  Not that it is playing badly or anything.  Is there a
way 
I can measure it somehow with feeler gauges or something?  And if it 
is not exactly symmetrical or even will it make a big difference in 
the way it plays?  Thank you for any helpful information.

Ross

You are on the right track but to use the feeler gauges you need a 
glass tool (25 bucks from babbit)with equadistant parallel markings on 
it to see if the feeler lines up across both rails (you would rest the 
glass or plexi on the mpc table and insert various feelers between the 
glass and the facing curve.  Yes it can make a big difference in tone 
and response if the rails are uneven.  SO..you can have it checked or 
go to the trouble of buying or making a glass/plexi gauge to check it.  
There is a file somewhere on this site with markings one can run off on 
clear stock on a lazer printer and stick to glass.  If your not going 
to reface, getting perfect mm scale is not that important.  

All in all its will take a bit of doing.  If it plays well I wouldnt be 
bothered.  In the end you will likely find errors and then feel 
compelled to spend money to have them fixed.
