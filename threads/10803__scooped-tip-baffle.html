            <pre class='message__body'>Hello fellow members,

I was redesigning my 3d model when I came across the same "problem" I allways get, when I&#39;m modelling the chamber I cant get the right tip rail and baffle. It&#39;s not really a problem more than a bit more work to get it the way I want. 

But when I was doing this I thought to myself, what would this shape do? and this shape meaning a scooped baffle near the tip, a sort of inverted rollover baffle. 

I&#39;ve added a picture in the Photos/alto section named Scooped mpc. It`s the last pic there. Or you can click on this link http://goo.gl/zOnXR

It reminded me of the Xaphoon&#39;s mpc, that one has a tip rail (from bamboo) and then it drops down half an inch.. only in this case a bit less.

kind regards,

Koen

Koen, this type of baffle usually causes sluggish response and increased resistance.

The modern Rico plastic mouthpieces have this design to an extent.  

I did a custom job like this for a client who was squeaking on on a Guardala LT.  Seemed to help.  The normal solutions for chirps were not working for him and he did not want to change reeds or his embouchure.

            <pre class='message__body'>Looks like he&#39;s talking about a pretty large drop at the inside edge of the
tip rail into a concave "negative baffle".  The Ricos have a trough behind
the tip rail, with a "positive" baffle close behind. A while back there was
some very interesting discussion about this second type of trough being a
positive feature in some cases (like helping with squeak problems).  I&#39;ve
worked on a few Rico pieces and generally preferred them with the trough
filled in.  Someone recommended gel-type super glue (cyano-acrylic) for
that, but I&#39;ve never tried it.

This portion of the Rico mouthpiece was so that they could totally mold all of the mouthpiece, the facing also molded, not machined separately, and not requiring hand work on the baffle.

The facing portion of the molding dies could be changed for various facings.

For other manufacturers, who used the same blank for various facings, each tip opening intersects the baffle at a different point, so that region immediately behind what is to become the tip rail must be finished separately by hand.  

It would be possible to mold a blank where no hand finishing would be required for the baffle, but only a very narrow range of tip openings could be made.

            <pre class='message__body'>He should try a Metalite to see if that design solves his "chirp" problem, then, (I&#39;m not that familiar with the market value of that Guardala model) you could convert the Guardala or an inexpensive Asian metal blank to a scooped tip baffle piece I suppose, or make one from solid brass rod.Â

So how would you approach adjusting a Guardala LT King for a client who chirps on it, even though you could not reproduce the problem when playing on it?

This was the solution!Â  I did this work last year for the client.Â  Closed the King down to .105, radial facing, 50L and lowered the baffle to raise the tip rail.Â  He was very pleased.

I really did not notice a major change in response.Â  The rest of the baffle is still very high.Â  It did darken the palm keys.Â  I closed it down from .122" to .105" and took resistance out of the facing curve shape so they were big changes too.

You can probably test the effect better by getting a Metalite and adding some temporary putty to it to bring the baffle up to the tip rail.

            <pre class='message__body'>I recall saying that "throat" playing isn&#39;t tolerated in professional circles. Â  It isn&#39;t considered "correct" playing technique and will not get you a performance degree from any institution of higher learning.Â  I am certain I did not mention any names.Â  If you are a throat player, well, you are certainly welcome to your own opinion on the matter.

Regardless, a trained ear can tell the difference between the characteristics of the player and those of the mouthpiece, to a substantial degree.Â  I liked the fat sound of slightly excavated (narrow groove behind tip) pieces that Gary Campbell students were using some years ago, though they did lack some brilliance in the tone - a trade-off I guess.Â  Just curious.

            <pre class='message__body'>This reminds me of my refaced lebayle. The music I use it in requires me to play a lot of high notes, and they were allways thin from G or A up.. and i`m not a biter, well sometimes but I know how to play properly.

The solution was to scoop uit a bit just after the tiprail, not as drasticly as Keith, itâs more a piece of straight baffle in comparance to a slight rollover it was before. I made some Picâs I think you can see it well.

I recall saying that "throat" playing isn&#39;t tolerated in professional circles.   It isn&#39;t considered "correct" playing technique and will not get you a performance degree from any institution of higher learning.  I am certain I did not mention any names.  If you are a throat player, well, you are certainly welcome to your own opinion on the matter.

Regardless, a trained ear can tell the difference between the characteristics of the player and those of the mouthpiece, to a substantial degree.  I liked the fat sound of slightly excavated (narrow groove behind tip) pieces that Gary Campbell students were using some years ago, though they did lack some brilliance in the tone - a trade-off I guess.  Just curious.

This was the solution!  I did this work last year for the client.  Closed the King down to .105, radial facing, 50L and lowered the baffle to raise the tip rail.  He was very pleased.

Perhaps closing down the mouthpiece to a more manageable reduced tip opening with a free blowing radial curve along with seeking the assistance of a respiratory specialist if he hasn&#39;t seen one is the way to go. --- kwbradbury@... wrote: From: Keith Bradbury &lt;kwbradbury@...m> To: "MouthpieceWork@yahoogroups.com" &lt;MouthpieceWork@yahoogroups.com> Subject: Re: Re: [MouthpieceWork] scooped tip baffle Date: Mon, 28 May 2012 14:28:53 -0700 (PDT)

            <pre class='message__body'>I uploaded the my play test of the Guardala King I modified last year to have a raised tip rail.  I used a Forestone 3 reed on it because it has a thin tip and they run soft.  It was the closest reed I had to the Java 2 he likes.

The altissimo response was bad.  I usually can get an octave out of any mouthpiece.  But I took this as a plus since chirps and squeaks are unwanted altissimo.  The client does not play altissimo so it was a good trade off for him.
