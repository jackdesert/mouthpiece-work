            <pre class='message__body'>Simple.  You seem to confuse us jam session participants as being employees when in fact we are not in the employ of the club owner at all.  Nor are we a vendor (as would be the whiskey purveyor or the electric company in your referenced example).  We are, in fact, customers who get the novel side benefit of being able to play in front of people for the sheer joy of it.  We are ourselves entertained by being able to do so and by the camaraderie of our fellow players.  That is our received value.  Not a stitch of discrimination in the deal.

When I was out there playing for money, most all of the guys I had the honor to share the stage with were old enough to be my father or grand father.  They came up in a time when big bands and small jazz groups were the popular music of the day.  They would tell me their "when I was your age" stories as long as I would sit there and listen and these were some of the most precious memories I have as a musician.  Anyways, they often talked about their gigs, but they always talked about the jam sessions that they would go to AFTER their gig.  Not that the gig wasn&#39;t important and enjoyable, but the jam session is where they really had their fun.  They spoke of those sessions with such reverence...you could see the twinkle in their eye when they spoke.  I assure you, they never felt a sense of discrimination (in a musical regard anyway).

So I&#39;ll head back to my day job now.  I&#39;ve already clogged up "the mouthpiecework" group too much.  =Sorry Mojo ;-)
