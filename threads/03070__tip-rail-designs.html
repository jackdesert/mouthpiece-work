I wrote to Paul to ask but then thought it might be best to post here 
as someone else eventually may wonder the same thing.  I have been 
working on my skills to perfect the tip rail.  I have noticed on some 
mouthpieces there is a very clear cut, sharply delineated inner edge 
on the tip rail while other mpcs have the inner line on the tip rail 
softer and rather rounded as it moves into the baffle and chamber.  I 
am curious if there is a "right way" or what differences the 
formation of the inner tip rail yeilds.  (I realize either way they 
need to be the correct thickness and uniform.)

I prefer a nicely delineated inner edge on the tip rail. Many Selmers 
lack a good tip rail. Articulation is easier and crisper with a well 
defined tip rail, IMO.

What explains some mouthpieces like my Lawton.  The tip rail inner 
edge is nearly nonexistent.  There is just a hint of a break as it 
slides into the chamber.  Is the issue different on hard rubber vs 
metal?

            <pre class='message__body'>My personal experience has been that the shape of the exact edge of the tip rail is not so important, but there should be a definite
break between the tip rail and the area of the baffle immediately behind it. In opening up more closed pieces the baffle right behind the tip rail tends to get very high--i.e. almost touching the reed. Cutting back the baffle here improves the response tremendously--makes the piece much more free-blowing and curbs the tendency towards chirping.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lawtons have nice chamber work, but their baffles are too high near the tip
rail for many players.  These designs are more prone to squeaks and chirps.
