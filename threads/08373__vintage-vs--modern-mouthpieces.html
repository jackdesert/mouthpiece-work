            <pre class='message__body'>Hugo Pinksterboer, in his book Tipbook Saxophone, talks about vintage vs. modern sax mouthpieces. On page 80 he writes "The older a horn is, the harder it will be to find it, a matching mouthpiece. Modern mouthpieces usually don&#39;t work well with the vintage saxes. First of all, they don&#39;t make them sound like vintage saxes. Also, certain notes may not respond well, and the entire instrument can sound out of balance or out of tune. Vintage mouthpieces are usually shorter and may have extremely round chambers, rather than the modern, &#39;straight&#39;type of chamber"

I am curious as to the readers thoughts in regards to Pinksterboer&#39;s assertion and if someone can speak to what mouthpiece manufacturers if any are producing mouthpieces designed to create that vintage sound.
