            <pre class='message__body'>For further refacing practice, I was about to work on a Yamaha YBS-L1 
bari mouthpiece.  It actually sounds OK, but the tip is currently .080 
and the curve is pretty sub-optimal.  I was thinking of opening it to 
.100 or .105.  The current facing length is 25 mm (50 on Babbitt gauge), 
about the same as some tenor pieces I have.  What&#39;s a reasonable facing 
length for a bari piece?  About 27-28 mm?  Thanks.

BTW, my brother - a dentist - is sending me some dental acrylic as a 
possible biteplate gouge repair solution.  I&#39;ll let you all know how it 
works out.
