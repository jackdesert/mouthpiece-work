            <pre class='message__body'>I would like to invite any members of this group attending the NAMM show
next week to stop by and say hello at our booth (#3015). It&#39;s always great
to be able to put faces with the names!

 

We will be exhibiting all 16 different mouthpiece models, a few mouthpiece
prototypes, all 8 different neck models, a couple of neck prototypes, our
full accessory line, and the full Saxgourmet saxophone line, including the
Category Five, Super 400, Voodoo Rex, Marcel, Saxello, Saxgourmet baritone,
and Saxgourmet curved soprano. All will be available for your inspection,
questions,  comparison, and play testing.

 

We will also have guest appearances by Kenny G, Ronnie Laws, and quite a few
other saxophone celebrities. I will be assisted at the booth by my favorite
six foot tall red head, Sharon Goodson,  and Saxgourmet Endorsing Artist,
the lovely and talented Aviva Malone.

 

NAMM anticipates attendance at this year&#39;s event to be around 80,000. The
show is not open to the public, and I do not have passes available and
cannot arrange admission for anyone who is not a member of NAMM.

also a negative side." Hunter S. Thompson
