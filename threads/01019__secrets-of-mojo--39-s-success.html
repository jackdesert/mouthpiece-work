            <pre class='message__body'>Mojo - I&#39;ve been reading all the posts out at SOTW praising your work. 
Congratulations, you&#39;re starting to gather quite a following, after a 
relatively short period of time (ain&#39;t the internet great?).

What would you say are the most important aspects of refacing mouthpieces to 
understand and master, in order to help the most people?

Or, to put it another way: what corrections/modifications seem to have the 
most immediate impact on the playability of a mouthpiece?

Mike R.

            <pre class='message__body'>> What would you say are the most important aspects of refacing 
mouthpieces to understand and master, in order to help the most 
people?

A. I think you need to be able to determine the areas in the 
mouthpiece that need to be changed to meet a player&#39;s goal.  The 
player is the client, and also yourself.

B. You then need the tools and skill to make the changes.

These 2 steps may seem obvious and not specific enough to help a new 
refacer.  But I think you will agree, if either one is done poorly, 
the work will not turn out well.

1. If the table is severely convex, fixing it will usually show a 
dramatic improvement.  This fixes leaks and ligature placement 
sensitivity.  Concave tables are more forgiving.  I prefer flat 
tables.

2. Most sax players like free-blowing pieces. By plotting the facing 
curve on a PC, I can see where the biggest facing curve problems are 
graphically.  This is better than looking at a column of measurement 
numbers, which is traditionally done.  By working on the parts of the 
curve that are most uneven (they have bumps and kinks) the piece will 
play much better.

3. Next, the tip rail should be defined.  I cut the tip to match the 
end of a reed.  I slightly relieve the area after the tip rail.  If 
there are complaints of "chirps", I go more.  Roll-over baffles seem 
to get in the way more often than not.  The tip rail can be as thin 
as .020" for fast articulation and response.  But you risk not being 
able to use all brands of reeds since they will hang off the tip or 
leak at the tip rail.  .030" is more forgiving.

These first 3 steps will probably get you 80% of what you are going 
to get out of the piece.

4. The next level would be to change the facing curve so that it is 
closer to a perfect radial arc, if it is not.  Flat sections would 
need to be removed by cutting the entire curve and table except the 
flat section.  You also need to have a good facing length and tip 
goal to construct a good radial facing curve.  I find my own 
calculated lay schedules to be better than measured and shared ones.

Beyond this, a piece can benefit from baffle work (more or less), tip 
rail work for improved altissimo response, wider window/thinner side 
rails for a bigger sound, tip work to not be too blunt (but not too 
sharp either).  The side rails should also not be much wider than the 
reed for the best response.  There are also situations where the 
facing can benefit from deviating from a radial arc.  But these are 
special situations, not the norm.
