            <pre class='message__body'>Hello!

I recently got a 10* Florida Link, it´s fun to play and it has a big 
and even sound... But the plating is gone and I play it on a MK6 
tenor which has no laquer any more. The laquer has been stripped off. 
I like the sound very much, but I think, without laquer/plate there 
is missing an important sound quality. I mean a certain "ringing" of 
overtones in the air, highly needed for projection in rooms...I own 
also another MK6 with laquer, it has more of this heights... My 
question is now: Has anybody experience with the effect of replating 
a Link? Does Babbit still offer this? Would it add the important high 
components of the sound, that means more projection? Or would it be a 
good idea to replate the neck/ or the horn in gold? I would 
appreciate any suggestions or ideas concerning this theme.

Many greetings and all the best for 2004, that´s a great group,

Chriss

          Keith is correct .  Plating also prevent oxdation and pitting off brass mouthpieces. It can also reduce wear
          if HARD GOLD plating is used.  Hard Gold plating contains about 2 % Cobalt which makes it last much longer than
          standard gold plating.  Just remember most gold plating are done over a thin layer of nickel. Some people are
          allergic to the nickel.  Chemical deposition of gold  is also not good enough for a MPC.  The plating has to be 
          electroplating  which allows for a thicker layer with good adhesion.

My opinion is that plating is only for cosmetic appearance and to provide a
barrier to the taste of brass.  If the response of a mouthpiece changes
after plating it would be due to small changes in the facing curve from
uneven plating.  This is just my opinion.  I have no scientific tests.
