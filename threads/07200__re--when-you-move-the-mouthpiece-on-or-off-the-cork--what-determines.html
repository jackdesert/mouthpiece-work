            <pre class='message__body'>I think it is easier to simply think of the entire system. The point of the exercise is to have a complete cone. Truncate the cone and you widen the resonances. You have to truncate the cone, though, or you don&#39;t have any place to put the mpc. So now you have to find a way to bring the resonances back in line. More volume at the top of any wind instrument--conical or cylindrical--will narrow the resonances. But how to do it in the correct amount for all frequencies? Unfortunately, you need to fulfill different conditions for different frequencies, since the widening of the resonances is both frequency dependent and dependent on the ratio of the diameter of the truncated end to the open end, which varies with frequency as well. 

There are two major conditions which need to be fulfilled. For the lower modes, a mpc volume which is the same as that of the missing conic apex does the trick, since at long wavelengths the ratio of the part of the wavelength that is screwed up by having a mpc instead of the conic tip to the total wavelength is small. But as the frequency increases, the proportion of the wavelength that is involved with the mpc instead of a cone gets greater and greater. In my understanding this has to do with the fact that a sax deals not just with transverse waves, like a cylinder, but involves the propagation of spherical waves, which are much more complex.

As the frequency rises, it is important that the mpc "look" more and more like the missing conic tip. Just mimicking the volume is no longer enough. Now the resonance frequency of the mpc as well must look like the resonance frequency of the missing conical apex.

When these two conditions are met, a "reasonable" result is achieved--good enough for jazz. The rest is up to the players and their art--to smooth out this and all the other manifold irregularities in a real-world instrument. But it is not really helpful to make a strict distinction between the mpc and the neck, since the system itself acts in a unitary manner.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lance,

My understanding is that the constriction is a point: the smallest diameter of the cone at the truncation, after which the cone flares smoothly. If that is the case, the oversize throat is not necessarily the major problem you make it out to be: it simply functions as a second part of the chamber until hitting the end of the neck, where the constriction always lies (unless you make a smaller point somewhere after the chamber and before the neck). Not necessarily ideal , in that you have an abrupt diameter "step" at the end of the neck, but not a major issue to tuning in and of itself, if the volume and Helmholtz resonance were correct.  So the arrangement of chamber and constriction is not so "constricted" as you seem to believe. Or am I wrong about this?

That&#39;s what I said.  And the throat is not a problem, unless:

1. you want better intonation
2. volume and frs are matched, which is usually NOT the case.

That idea belongs to you.  It did not come from me.  I would make the constricion, as I have said about 20 times already, the same size as the neck opening.

Yes, you are wrong.  Though you understood clearly an hour ago in an email, you have now forgotten again.  You could re-read slowly to get clear on it.  It is not that complicate.

Lance,
 
My understanding is that the constriction is a 
point: the smallest diameter of the cone at the truncation, after which the cone 
flares smoothly. If that is the case, the oversize throat is not necessarily the 
major problem you make it out to be: it simply functions as a second part of the 
chamber until hitting the end of the neck, where the constriction always lies 
(unless you make a smaller point somewhere after the chamber and before the 
neck). Not necessarily ideal , in that you have an abrupt diameter "step" at the 
end of the neck, but not a major issue to tuning in and of itself, if the volume 
and Helmholtz resonance were correct.  So the arrangement of chamber and 
constriction is not so "constricted" as you seem to believe. Or am I wrong about 
this?
 
Toby

It depends on what you 
        are trying to see.  The division of chamber and constriction is not 
        arbitrary.  They are 2 essential parts of the system, each with a 
        different function, position, and shape, though they work 
        together.   

Toby, frankly, I find most of your

        merely repeat the same acoustical formulas and terms, almost randomly, 
        making nebulous statements about their significance, seldom has to do

        clear ideas.  Is there any way we could like, stay on the

          I think it is easier to simply think of 
          the entire system. The point of the exercise is to have a complete 
          cone. Truncate the cone and you widen the resonances. You have to 
          truncate the cone, though, or you don&#39;t have any place to put the mpc. 
          So now you have to find a way to bring the resonances back in line. 
          More volume at the top of any wind instrument-- conical or 
          cylindrical- -will narrow the resonances. But how to do it in the 
          correct amount for all frequencies? Unfortunately, you need to fulfill 
          different conditions for different frequencies, since the widening of 
          the resonances is both frequency dependent and dependent on the ratio 
          of the diameter of the truncated end to the open end, which varies 
          with frequency as well. 
           
          There are two major conditions which need 
          to be fulfilled. For the lower modes, a mpc volume which is the same 
          as that of the missing conic apex does the trick, since at long 
          wavelengths the ratio of the part of the wavelength that is screwed up 
          by having a mpc instead of the conic tip to the total wavelength is 
          small. But as the frequency increases, the proportion of the 
          wavelength that is involved with the mpc instead of a cone gets 
          greater and greater. In my understanding this has to do with the fact 
          that a sax deals not just with transverse waves, like a cylinder, but 
          involves the propagation of spherical waves, which are much more 
          complex.
           
          As the frequency rises, it is important 
          that the mpc "look" more and more like the missing conic tip. Just 
          mimicking the volume is no longer enough. Now the resonance frequency 
          of the mpc as well must look like the resonance frequency of the 
          missing conical apex.
           
          When these two conditions are met, a 
          "reasonable" result is achieved--good enough for jazz. The rest is up 
          to the players and their art--to smooth out this and all the other 
          manifold irregularities in a real-world instrument. But it is not 
          really helpful to make a strict distinction between the mpc and the 
          neck, since the system itself acts in a unitary manner. What happens 
          after the end of the neck affects the overall character of the whole 
          system, but it is an integral part of the system.

Jbtsax and I discussed this at 
                  length.  You have just inserted a 1/4" 
                  constriction.  For the mouthpiece, (chamber + throat) the 
                  constriction insert displaces an amount equal to the volume of 
                  it&#39;s walls.  The volume of the constriction insert bore 
                  is it&#39;s own.  This way you can keep chamber volume and 
                  constriction volume (length) separate for analyzing your 
                  chamber design (baffle displaced x% of chamber volume for 
                  example) and your constiction design (cylindrical, reverse 
                  cone, reverse parabolic, etc).  In the end, to calculate 
                  the total volume of the substitution, the constriction bore 
                  (bore only) volume is added to the chamber+throat 
                  volume.  The insert is not part of the neck.  It is 
                  a new part of the mouthpiece.

If the total volume before the constriction is correct and
the Helmholtz resonance is correct, then your intonation
is optimized, no matter where the volume is: in the
chamber or the throat or in both. This is what I meant
about treating the whole system as a unity. There is no
real distinction between the chamber and the throat: all
volume before the constriction counts. Don&#39;t forget that
the Helmholtz resonance should be measured at the
constriction and including it, so that you need to figure
in the diameter of the end of the neck at the position it
would be with the mpc on the neck. My point is this: if
the volume and HH resonance are correct, the oversize
throat should not be a problem. If you think this is
untrue please tell me why.

I just wanted to point out that if you make  a point in
the throat smaller than the neck opening, that point
becomes the constriction. I am not recommending it.

Lance, I am not trying to be difficult, but I don&#39;t
believe that we (collectively) are getting this story
straight. I have not changed my understanding, and if you
think I have then please explain where you find me
misguided,

Good question.  That was the error in my thinking and procedure that skewed the results of the tests as I tried the experiment again with longer inserts.  By pulling the mouthpiece off the cork until the pitch was again in tune with the insert added, there was good correlation with the distance representing the volume of a solid disk, and the volume of the walls of the hollow insert.

A post I wrote earlier with links to pages on my website give more information about my tests and conclusions.

Of course.

Look at the diagram I uploaded to the Files/Misc Other folder  - Constriction.jpg.  As per above, when we check the playing frequency (HH res) of the mouthpiece we must include the neck end constriction.  At that playing frequency the displacement anti-node of our HH res is located at the constriction and everything is good (this is an over simplification and I&#39;ll show why later).  The HH res freq does not stay constant however.  If we play notes below the HH res freq., those notes pull the HH res freq down with them slightly, so that the HH res displacement anti-node moves into the neck tube.  It&#39;s a conical instrument so the effects of the enlarging bore on the HH freq Disp. AN. (raises it) are part of the plan.  

If we play notes above the HH res freq, those notes pull the HH res freq up with them so that now the HH freq Disp AN is located in the overly large throat, the diameter of which is much larger than the constriction that we used to base our HH res freq on.  As a result, the HH res freq is raised even more and as it affects other nodes in the area, they are raised as well, out of proportion to the lower register

In reality, when we first check our HH res freq, the Disp AN is half in the throat and half in the neck constricton, so it is actually higher than what it should be.  For a correct HH res freq and for even tuning throughout the range of the instrument, the constriction which is the diameter of the neck opening, should have some length, at least enough to insure that  the HH rew freq. is not unduely raised.  To a point, the longer the constriction, the more stable and even the intonation, provided the correct volume and frs are maintained.

This is just a way to improve intonation on any still very usable normal mouthpiece.

If the total volume before the constriction is correct and

the Helmholtz resonance is correct, then your intonation

is optimized, no matter where the volume is: in the

chamber or the throat or in both. This is what I meant

about treating the whole system as a unity. There is no

real distinction between the chamber and the throat: all

volume before the constriction counts. Don&#39;t forget that

the Helmholtz resonance should be measured at the

constriction and including it, so that you need to figure

in the diameter of the end of the neck at the position it

would be with the mpc on the neck. My point is this: if

the volume and HH resonance are correct, the oversize

throat should not be a problem. If you think this is

untrue please tell me why.

I just wanted to point out that if you make  a point in

the throat smaller than the neck opening, that point

becomes the constriction. I am not recommending it.

Lance, I am not trying to be difficult, but I don&#39;t

believe that we (collectively) are getting this story

straight. I have not changed my understanding, and if you

think I have then please explain where you find me

misguided,



Toby

I am repeating an earlier post that did not appear on the forum that
provided the links mentioned above.

I have expanded and refined my study of the effects upon pitch by
altering mouthpiece volume.  The write up of the study and a related
paper can be found at this link:    Mouthpiece Volume and Pitch Study
&lt;http://www.jbtsaxmusic.net/Mouthpiece%20Volume%20and%20Pitch%20Studies.&#92;
html>

Thanks to Lance and Keith for pointing out that in order to replace the
volume displaced by the insert, the mouthpiece needs to be pulled the
the distance representing the volume of a solid disk.  I appreciated
this helpful correction to my procedure.

short relevant exerpts?

I mean, are you sure you have that right? Clearly when the
mpc is being sounded without being attached the open end
is a displacement antinode, but once you extend the air
column everything changes except the fact that the reed is
a pressure antinode, because end of the mpc is no longer
the end of the air column.

I sent you this info before as well, from Nederveen, Rokaboy, and other recent studies.  The resonance is formed by the PARTIAL reflection of the wave, back towards the mouthpiece, by the difference in impedance between the constriction and the body tube opening.  As such, for this resonance, the body tube entrance is seen as the open end of the tube.

short relevant exerpts?



I mean, are you sure you have that right? Clearly when the

mpc is being sounded without being attached the open end

is a displacement antinode, but once you extend the air

column everything changes except the fact that the reed is

a pressure antinode, because end of the mpc is no longer

the end of the air column.

            <pre class='message__body'>Ah, which determines the length of time the reed is
closed, depending on the truncation, right? I&#39;ll look it
up in Nederveen, which I do have.

I&#39;m still wondering, though, how this could change the
Helmholtz resonance of the mpc. Even if the point at which
this partial wave is reflected changes based on frequency,
the constriction is still seen as the point of smallest
diameter before the cone begins to widen out. This is
still the end of the neck, no? I don&#39;t see how this
affects the first resonance matching of the mpc, which
simply states that the HH rez of the the mpc at the
constriction should match that of the truncated conic
apex. These are both frequency independent values AFAIK.

BTW I reread Benade and his saying that the neck is the
constriction now makes perfect sense to me. He clearly
means that the *end* of the neck is the constriction, just
as the end of the staple is the constriction for the oboe.

            <pre class='message__body'>From  what I understand that is the HH resonance.  Testing the mouthpiece&#39;s HH freq separated from the system (which is what we have to do as mortals) is  only an approximation of the mean frequency, of that what the system actually sees under playing conditions.  Everything changes as everything is affected by everything else.  There is no constant anything.

Benade described the correct substitution as seen from the body standpoint under playning conditions.  The body sees a pressure node (diplacement anti-node) just inside the bocal at frequencies above frs and moving gradually down, to just inside the body tube, for frequencies below frs.  That&#39;s almost a quote.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m not so sure about the significance of the movement of
the antinode at frs. The HH resonance is based on the
volume of the mpc and the diameter of the exit hole. That
value should match the resonance of the truncated cone. If
you think about it, the resonance shouldn&#39;t change: the
value is fixed, just as the resonance frequency of the
conic tip is fixed. Anyway, at this point I think we are
getting into territory so esoteric that it has little
relevance to the chaos of actual playing conditions...

Aside from speculation, do you have any intel on what the
movement of the antinode at the constriction actually
signifies under playing conditions?

                  I&#39;m not so sure about the significance of the movement of

the antinode at frs. The HH resonance is based on the

volume of the mpc and the diameter of the exit hole. That

value should match the resonance of the truncated cone. If

you think about it, the resonance shouldn&#39;t change: the

value is fixed, just as the resonance frequency of the

conic tip is fixed. Anyway, at this point I think we are

getting into territory so esoteric that it has little

relevance to the chaos of actual playing conditions.. .



Aside from speculation, do you have any intel on what the

movement of the antinode at the constriction actually

signifies under playing conditions?

Making a double reed saxophone mouthpiece would have the same effect as the deservingly obselete sarrusaphone.

Actually, I think that the truncation ratio is much too
great on a sax to make this work. You could build a bocal
for the neck and then mount a double reed, though.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would also be interested in being directed to sources of information about the Helmholtz resonance inside the mouthpiece and the partial reflection of the sound wave at the opening of the constriction.

This forum format is taking some getting used to since it is quite different from other forums I have participated on. Please excuse my stumbling when it happens until I get my bearings.

Most of my study to date has been involved with the acoustics of the body of the instrument itself. What is happening inside the mouthpiece and the relationship between that and the body tube is a new area for me that admittedly I know little about at the present time.  

Has anyone had a chance to view the information on my website that I provided a link to a few days ago on this forum?  I would welcome some feedback on that as well.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had thought about this as well, but I guess it will be
very difficult to exactly match the lay of the rails and
the reed strengths so that both have the same ability to
vibrate. Real double reeds have curved reeds which beat
against each other. Let us know if you actually get it
functioning!
