I recently read a message where someone has made a facing jig.
What are the down sides of using this type of tool against hand 
facing?
If the tool was rigid and the work done slowly,I would have thought 
that a perfect curve should result every time.
The curve could also be changed at any distance by changing the 
radius, say for opening the tip up a bit.
Has anyone had success or failures with this type of tool? 

Thanks for the advice Keith.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Ross
If you&#39;re referring to my post of Jan 28, showing a home made jig, It&#39;s not worth the effort.
It&#39;s very hard to hold the piece still enough.
The paper loads quickly, and then cuts unevenly.
You have very little control over lay length..

It does swing nicely through an arc, but would be much more useful as a clock pendulum.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keep in mind that precision on the order of .0001" is needed to get the
side rails even.  A tilting feeler gage illustrates the uneveness.

It is difficult to make a jig with moving parts that can hold a mouthpiece
so well that is does not shift around by more than .0001".
