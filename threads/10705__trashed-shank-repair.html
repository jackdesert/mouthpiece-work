            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m a repair tech - one of the school baris I worked on yesterday had a Selmer S90 in the case with a jagged, shattered shank.  To be clear, it&#39;s not cracked, the end of the shank is gone and what&#39;s left is pointy, jagged, and broken.  Since there was also a Yamaha mouthpiece present and I&#39;m pretty sure the Selmer would have shredded the cork if they tried to put it on the neck, I expect they aren&#39;t using the Selmer.  Anyways, it seems like I could use the lathe to cut a clean end on this thing and turn down a considerable length of the remaining shank onto which I could then intsall a replacement shank "sleeve" (kind of like a clarinet tenon/socket replacement if you&#39;re familiar with that).  It&#39;s never crossed my mind before, but most of the time it&#39;s the tip that shatters rather than the shank, most mouthpieces aren&#39;t long or fat enough for this to be useful, and the time involved in such a project would generally make it financially impractical, but this is a $200-250 mouthpiece, so it could be worthwhile if it works.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve made plenty of shank extensions, which is the same thing.  You&#39;ll have to make a mandrel that fits the throat snugly to mount the piece on for turning what&#39;s left of the shank.  As long as there is enough shank length left before the butt of the table, it will work fine.

I&#39;ve banded a number of S80 alto and tenor mouthpieces.  The shank is too thin, and cracking is common.  I have not made an extension as you describe and don&#39;t think it is worth the time expended.  Also, I am not sure it would remain glued on.

            <pre class='message__body'>On some of my "modern" Selmers I&#39;ve made them into Short Shanks, basically cut & smoothed half the shank away to make them the same length as my other mpcs.  They work just fine too.  So don&#39;t think that you have to replace the entire shank to the same length as before.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Morgan.

There is enough space between the point where the parallel gripping surfaces of the Jacobs chuck jaws start and the back wall of the chuck body, to give the end of a specially machined tool shaft a retaining flange.  The tool won&#39;t pull out.  Still, I&#39;m making a collet chuck holder for more precise work.

An adjustable length "squeeze" might be interesting, but this design works just like the old Conn Adjustable did, varying the length of the larger diameter throat section by varying the length of the smaller diameter shank inserted into it.

>       Here are some picts of less-than CNC (manual) mouthpiece fabrication from solid brass rod.Â  I use specially sized (in shop), telescoping tubing for the brazed throat and shank insert.Â  I don&#39;t plan to go CNC, as all the chamber styles I&#39;m interested in must be hand cut primarily. These picts are using a HF milling vise, a $50 scrap yard drill press from 1910 (heavy duty) that is sturdy enough to function as a light milling machine, DIY cutting tool holders (fly cutter), a manual lathe, hand files, and lapidary grits.Â  I plan to add a large manual rotary table and suitable work holding tooling and that will be sufficient for me.
