I&#39;ve banded a number of S80 alto and tenor mouthpieces.  The shank is too thin, and cracking is common.  I have not made an extension as you describe and don&#39;t think it is worth the time expended.  Also, I am not sure it would remain glued on.

            <pre class='message__body'>Here are some picts of less-than CNC (manual) mouthpiece fabrication from solid brass rod.  I use specially sized (in shop), telescoping tubing for the brazed throat and shank insert.  I don&#39;t plan to go CNC, as all the chamber styles I&#39;m interested in must be hand cut primarily. These picts are using a HF milling vise, a $50 scrap yard drill press from 1910 (heavy duty) that is sturdy enough to function as a light milling machine, DIY cutting tool holders (fly cutter), a manual lathe, hand files, and lapidary grits.  I plan to add a large manual rotary table and suitable work holding tooling and that will be sufficient for me.

      Here are some picts of less-than CNC (manual) mouthpiece fabrication from solid brass rod.  I use specially sized (in shop), telescoping tubing for the brazed throat and shank insert.  I don&#39;t plan to go CNC, as all the chamber styles I&#39;m interested in must be hand cut primarily. These picts are using a HF milling vise, a $50 scrap yard drill press from 1910 (heavy duty) that is sturdy enough to function as a light milling machine, DIY cutting tool holders (fly cutter), a manual lathe, hand files, and lapidary grits.  I plan to add a large manual rotary table and suitable work holding tooling and that will be sufficient for me.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Morgan.

There is enough space between the point where the parallel gripping surfaces of the Jacobs chuck jaws start and the back wall of the chuck body, to give the end of a specially machined tool shaft a retaining flange.  The tool won&#39;t pull out.  Still, I&#39;m making a collet chuck holder for more precise work.

An adjustable length "squeeze" might be interesting, but this design works just like the old Conn Adjustable did, varying the length of the larger diameter throat section by varying the length of the smaller diameter shank inserted into it.
