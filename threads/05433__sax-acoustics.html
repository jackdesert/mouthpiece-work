I love that whole website.  I agree with you, and I bet that graph is a 
schematic representation.  We know the end-membar cases are correct.   
In the middle area it may be a better representation of the effective 
backpressure or resistance that is created by the system, against which 
you can still force more air with increased pressure.

            <pre class='message__body'>The louder you play the more time, in the 360* cycle the reed is fully closed off.  It approaches 180* of the cycle, so half the time it is closed, no air flow.  But the air is being used very efficiently.  Almost all of the air used is vibrating the air column in the most efficient manner.  The air puffs through the tip opening at exactly the right time to excite the vibrating air column in proper phase.
   
  At very low volume levels the air is just slipping past the reed and very little of the energy is going toward making the air column vibrate.
   
  As Len says, those are the two "end points" of the functioning of the reed, instrument, and breath.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah....

But do you FEEL less air is being used as you get louder?  

It could be that the left side of the curve should have a more gradual
(lower) slope, the top more pointed, and the right side should be steeper.

I&#39;m not sure this is it either:
