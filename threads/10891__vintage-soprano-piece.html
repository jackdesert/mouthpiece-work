            <pre class='message__body'>When I was looking for something on the mouthpiecemuseum a few weeks ago I
stumbled on a somewhat identical mpc.

The museum says it`s an "unmarked vintage Brilhart large chamber soprano
mouthpiece from the 1920/30s. It features a red marbled hard rubber, concave
side walls, and has a small tip opening of 0.045" typical for that period."

 

I have no idea what it`s worth though.

 

Regards,

 

Koen

Hello,

  Can someone identify this soprano mouthpiece for me? Short,  low baffle,
big bore, carved out under side rails.

  It came out of a Truetone Buescher case. I remember seeing one like it
somewhere before.

 It is definitely made of rubber.

  Before I reface it for a customer, who will probably just leave it in his
case, I want to make sure it is not valuable enough  to sell   on ebay.

 Thank you,            Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>  Bingo! Thank you. I actually looked there too without finding it.   It plays like a rather stuffy Otto Link slant sig. I know that the old Bueschers sometimes go for pretty good money on ebay.  Of course it would be more  fun for me to reface it but I will have to ask the owner what he wants.</pre>
