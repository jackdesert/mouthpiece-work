            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks to the whole group. I'ma big your reader and am learning a lot.
I need your opinions. I am an apprentice maker for clarinet mouthpieces. I am learning since 1 year and 30 blanks. I think my progress has been good (better than my English), but I have a problem. When I play with my mouthpieces f or ff, the sound is not centered, without any focus and the brightness souns is too present.  This is not in when I play normally (not ff). Can anyone help me to know why it happens? What area am working wrong?
Thank you for your replys,
My best regards
SJG
