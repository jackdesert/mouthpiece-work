            <pre class='message__body'>Couple of photos on Facebook of a couple of guys in Boston using silver solder to add material to the tip of a Florida Link.  They used a small sheet of brass as a liner inside the tip I think.  Not enough photos to tell what it looked liked before they started.

            <pre class='message__body'>Brazing works great for brass provided you don&#39;t overheat and get pin holes from bubbling zinc and you don&#39;t mind a visible seam.  For low temp baffles, nothing works quite as nice as a ruined Dukoff or the 96/4 tin/silver solder.  You need an acid flux for best results.  96/4 comes with it in a small bottle.  For low amperage TIG filling/repairs, silicon bronze or aluminum bronze is commonly used.  For the purist, who wants a raw brass finish with no seam or sign of repair, brass filler (same type) is used.
