            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,
My first post and I think I have something to contribute here. 
Keith, I saw in your photos->gauging area that you are measuring the
tip with the internal jaws. What I did is patterned after that Winslow
kit tip measuring device. My calipers have a depth measuring blade at
the other end. So
I take an external measurment of the Glass (mine=.183") then I place
the mpc and glass gauge flush with the flat body and extend the depth
blade to measure the tip.
Try it and see if you like it better than using the "JAWS"

            <pre class='message__body'>I experimented with using the depth end when I was first getting started. 
I felt both methods required an equal amount of skill to get repeatable
results.  I think both methods require you to take 3-5 readings to convince
yourself you have found the tip opening.  Using the inside jaws of the
calipers has the advantage that there is no math involved (the subtraction
of the glass gage thickness).  Of course, you could zero the calipers (if
they are digital) on the glass gage thickness to avoid the math.

will stick with the depth gauge, but it sure is easier the other way...
