            <pre class='message__body'>You will find an unlimited supply of such vendors at the winter (not summer)
NAMM show, Musik Messe, and the Shanghai Music Fair. I don&#39;t know of any of
those companies that maintain web sites. Most are very small specialty
operations, with only a couple of employees and most likely speak only
Mandarin. If you are dealing directly with a factory, be aware you will be
expected to buy at least a hundred pieces at once and pay in advance via
bank wire. I deal with five different such vendors in Asia (three in China,
two in Taiwan) and I don&#39;t think any of them has more than four people on
staff. It is most important to be VERY specific about what you want and the
exact materials to be used in order to avoid surprises! The Asian culture
has a different definition of "sample" than we use in the west, so you must
be perfectly clear about your expectations.

 

I am not aware that any of the Asian trading companies deal in this sort of
thing. You might contact Beijingmusco (very reputable and good English
skills, a rarity in the world of trading companies in Asia) and ask them to
help you. They have excellent contacts throughout Asia and will most likely
know where to get the sort of thing you are looking for. Here&#39;s a link, tell
them you are my third cousin on my mother&#39;s side of the family:
