            <pre class='message__body'>I have two brand new clari pieces (came with Buffet horns) with Buffet 
logos and the notation F3A on one side and 125 G on the other.

Does anyone know what these really are (Buffet doesn&#39;t make mpcs, do 
they?)?  Van Doren?  Which one?

The look like pretty middle of the road things (haven&#39;t played &#39;em and 
don&#39;t have my measuring stuff yet).

I&#39;m considering doing some work on them to get started.

            <pre class='message__body'>The stock Buffet pieces are acrylic, made by ESM in Germany. The 125 
is the tip opening - 1.25mm, or about .048".

They reface fairly well - I do them as student mouthpieces with 
a .045 tip and a ML facing. I&#39;ll post my numbers for them from work, 
if you&#39;re interested.
