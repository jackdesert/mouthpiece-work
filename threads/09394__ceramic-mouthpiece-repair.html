            <pre class='message__body'>I have not worked on one but I would try JB Weld.   But first I would check with 
Drake.  I think they were offering free replacements at one time.

            <pre class='message__body'>as an update: I filled the chip with JB Weld, which worked well. An  
observation: the material used on this mouthpiece is REALLY soft, and  
I suspect we will see a lot of them damaged.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve never epaired a mouthpiece with it, but I&#39;ve used an epoxy adhesive with a filler to repair statuary. I used Araldite and a tile grout of the appropriate colour and it produces an extremely hard repair that works easily and finishes well. You&#39;d have to consider toxicity, it wasn&#39;t an issue for me but it might be for you. Alternatively, explore the area of dental fillers.
