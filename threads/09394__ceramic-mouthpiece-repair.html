            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve never epaired a mouthpiece with it, but I&#39;ve used an epoxy adhesive with a filler to repair statuary. I used Araldite and a tile grout of the appropriate colour and it produces an extremely hard repair that works easily and finishes well. You&#39;d have to consider toxicity, it wasn&#39;t an issue for me but it might be for you. Alternatively, explore the area of dental fillers.
