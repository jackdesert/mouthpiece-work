            <pre class='message__body'>Dear All,

It has been awhile I&#39;ve kept up with group but a question has come
to mind about a particular mouthpiece.  It&#39;s the Rico Royal Grafto-
nite that from what I&#39;ve read, may be more sturdier than hard 
rubber.  The main feature, as I&#39;m sure you know, is the price that
can be under $20.00.

Would anyone care to share their opnions about this mouthpiece?
Played it, the B5 model for bari sax and to be honest, I&#39;m impres-
sed.  Impressed enough to order the B7 I feel may suit my needs
being the most open.  Thanks.

Sincerely,
Harry E. Cartwright

I visited Arnold when he was giving away the prototypes and he had me throw one on the ground.  It didn&#39;t break or chip.  The nice feature of his pieces is the side rail design, enabling one to change the facing with less effort.  He gave me a couple of bari and soprano pieces which were very good.  I like closer facings myself, but only you can determine what is best for you.  John

            <pre class='message__body'>I recently tried a Graftonite clarinet mouthpiece and was shocked at how well it played.  The design of the baffle and chamber is quite radical, yet it sounded very conventional!  My soprano sax came with one and it is OK, but I use something else as a rule.  I really dislike the rough surface those mouthpieces have.  To me, they are unplayable without a mouthpiece patch.  I know someone who grinds Grafrtonite tenor mouthpieces down smooth, also reducing their mass some.

Dear All,

It has been awhile I&#39;ve kept up with group but a question has come
to mind about a particular mouthpiece.  It&#39;s the Rico Royal Grafto-
