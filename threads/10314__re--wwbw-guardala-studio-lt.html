            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everybody,

 

I have a few questions for you all, I hope you have time to answer during
these busy days. 

 

I Recently traded 2 OL`s for a wwbw Guardala Studio LT. This one was refaced
by Brian Powell, from a .117 to a .105 and he did some chamber work. This is
my first time on a guardala, and a refaced piece. But this is one hell of a
player, the dynamic range is enormous, i never played that soft on a .100+
mpc. And well, when I want to go loud.. there just seems to be no end to it!
The only "problem"I have is that the lower register doesn`t speak as well as
lower baffled pieces, but tonight (after receiving it yesterday) I had some
more playtime and with some throat and embouchure adjustments it`ll work
just have to search sometimes.

 

Now some of  work ( I can see) Brian Powell did and where I&#39;d like to know
what effect they have;

 

1.       He straightended the side walls;

2.       He enlarged the chamber / throat;

3.       He straightened, ( from presumeabley rounder form to a more
straight form) the bit coming from the thraot leading up to the window.

 

Happy holidays from the Netherlands!

            <pre class='message__body'>1. Probably negligible.  LT side rails are very thin and usually very even in thickness.  If you mean BP smoothed out the surface inside the sidewalls, this would not have much effect, if any.
2. How much?  Enlarging the throat squeeze diameter makes the design somewhere between the Studio and the MB2.
3. BP probably reshaped this after he cut down the table to close the tip.  That edge got too sharp and thin.
 
The biggest change is probably from the work on the facing curve.  You did not mention that.  We do not know how the new curve compares to the original one.  BP does good work, but someone would need to measure the facing curve to know if it is long like the original DG curve or is now medium or what.  
 
I think the Studio design can play fine with a reduced tip opening.

Maybe I&#39;m not that smart but what is the question? Studio has a long and high baffle and I would not try to make one of less than .115. Smaller ones will have limited low end and .105 will have extremely limited one. It is what it is. If somebody can measure the piece and if the facing is shorter, low end will slightly benefit from longer facing of up to 27mm.

Hi everybody,
 
I have a few questions for you all, I hope you have time to answer during these busy days. 
 
I Recently traded 2 OL`s for a wwbw Guardala Studio LT. This one was refaced by Brian Powell, from a .117 to a .105 and he did some chamber work. This is my first time on a guardala, and a refaced piece. But this is one hell of a player, the dynamic range is enormous, i never played that soft on a .100+ mpc. And well, when I want to go loud.. there just seems to be no end to it! The only “problem”I have is that the lower register doesn`t speak as well as lower baffled pieces, but tonight (after receiving it yesterday) I had some more playtime and with some throat and embouchure adjustments it`ll work just have to search sometimes.
 
Now some of  work ( I can see) Brian Powell did and where I’d like to know what effect they have;
 
1.       He straightended the side walls;
2.       He enlarged the chamber / throat;
3.       He straightened, ( from presumeabley rounder form to a more straight form) the bit coming from the thraot leading up to the window.
 
Happy holidays from the Netherlands!

There is no way closing the tip from .111" to .105" is going to create response problems that requires lowering the baffle except near the tip rail.  If there are response problems, they are due to the facing curve length/shape, reed choice, sax, and/or player&#39;s learning curve (embochure).

what&#39;s going on without examining & measuring (& playing) the mouthpiece -
preferably alongside an untouched version of it for comparison.  The fact
that it was already refaced when he got it says "all bets are off".
Subsequent work by a renowned refacer makes one think "maybe it&#39;s the reed
and/or embouchure".  Lack of facing measurements makes the curve a wild
card in assessment. As always, these discussions are interesting and
enlightening, but I don&#39;t think he should expect a definitive, actionable
answer.  That being said... my money is on facing curve, reed choice,
and/or embouchure.

Thanks for another year of great information & insight, guys!

            <pre class='message__body'>  Perhaps  BP refaced this mouthpiece because of a damaged tip. I fixed a Studio Guardala for a friend and the work I ended up doing on it seems similar to what is being described with this mouthpiece.   I also ended up with a slightly more closed tip and shorter  table.

@martinmods; the middle register isn`t that big of a problem, sometimes the D1 feels like it wants to go motorbaoting but I correct it before it does, I&#39;ve got more problems with motorbaoting on Bb1 and B1 but i&#39;m getting better at it. and I&#39;m sure it`s not my sax. but maybe it`s just my voicing.
@keith (and in general); I think I wasnt that clear about point 1.  It looks like he made the angle between the baffle en side wals straighter, like he put a triangular file in there.
and when I got this mpc it was allready refaced, so I dont have any data from the before situation but you can clearly see where work has been done.

Can, but it&#39;s a matter of degree as well.  Given a well made/balanced facing and tip, nicely shaped baffle, and optimal facing length,  I find the horn will seemingly sound/respond fine except for the middle low register (starting on E1 usually), which will crack and speak poorly, if the baffle is too high.  One must "search" for the a working voicing for the low notes, just as the OP describes, and it is impossible to align the chamber frequency/volume relationship for good intonation.  Making the baffle slightly lower then, corrects all issues.

To clarify, I didn&#39;t say the middle register would be a problem.  I said the middle-low register - starting at E1.  In such a case where the baffle is slightly too high, an accomplished player will not have terrible difficulty negotiating the low end in a pinch (no pun intended), but faced with performing on the mouthpiece daily, they would find it annoying and change it.  The less accomplished player, still becoming familiar with note voicings, will find it very frustrating.
