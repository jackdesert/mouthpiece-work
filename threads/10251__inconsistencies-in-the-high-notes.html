            <pre class='message__body'>Dear colleagues,
I my little shop have always noticed that many players come with a problem in common: Inconsistency in the high notes of yours saxes. For example, when playing G sharp which also sounded a multiphonic. Or when they play palm-E was the same. On several occasions I have tried to address this sensitive issue as a simple observation or comment, but I suspect that within the broad panel of observers and collaborators who have experienced will be the same as me in my workshop.
 So versatile it can be to resolve such issue is that I put on the table and let me know their experiences as the subject is quite interesting. I want to share experiences. I have solved many problems of this type and some with more success than others and why not say, by chance or by intuition led, evidence, trial and error.
 I know there are reasons inherent in the design, opening and shaped pipes entry, also the performer play modes, Mouthpieces inadequate, inappropriate reeds, etc., ETC.
 The issue is on the table, who knows something, speak or forever a hug

            <pre class='message__body'>my 2 cents from a player point of view: I agree almost completely with Silverio&#39;s thoughts,

that in my opinion stresses the importance of having a properly set mouthpiece, one whose parts are evenly balanced in the right way, thus allowing for all the proper actions needed to get a good tone (which is of course subjective) and play in tune in the whole range (which of course is not subjective....) to start with, before stepping into the altissimo register, without having to fight to compensate the possible mouthpiece faults, which can be quite stressful and finally it&#39;s a losing game.

In my opinion a mouthpiece can&#39;t make actual what a player is uncapable of making real, but should provide all the resources needed to a correct general playing gesture. All the rest needs to be built through commitment and practice that are extended in time, a fact whose awareness is probably neglected by those players who are constantly looking for another mouthpiece. Hopefully some will get to this simple truth through experience,

greetings from Italy,

Stefano D&#39;Anna

            <pre class='message__body'>In order to play the altissimos, the player MUST configure the oral 
tract to reinforce one of the partials being sounded. This is absolutely
 essential to playing altissimos, since the tube will at that point does
 not have the impedance peaks to force the reed to vibrate at the 
desired frequency. And the damping of the reed must also be adjusted 
with the embouchure, and the attack needs to be finessed. 

I find that I can play altissimos with just about any mpc, but each one requires a different adjustment and of course a different reed strength. That being said, some mpcs are easier for me than others in the high range.

In order to play the altissimos, the player MUST configure the oral tract to
reinforce one of the partials being sounded. This is absolutely essential to
playing altissimos, since the tube will at that point does not have the
impedance peaks to force the reed to vibrate at the desired frequency. And the
damping of the reed must also be adjusted with the embouchure, and the attack
needs to be finessed. I find that I can play altissimos with just about any
mpc, but each one requires a different adjustment and of course a different
reed strength. That being said, some mpcs are easier for me than others in the
high range. \\--- On **Wed, 2011/12/7, Stefano D'Anna _< mf2098@tiscali.it>_**

The configuration for the larynx or oral tract is a learned habit by practicing the overtone series or bugle call tones based on the low notes of the saxophone.  This leads to good response and better intonation on the altissimo notes as opposed to just biting the reed and blowing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi MM
&#39;ve Played well the content of the topic I proposed, driven by the problem that presented itself with this instrument that brought me, an alto saxophonist with the neck shortened just going to know why "sinister" reason /: (&lt;

 I tell them that I could solve it in the following way: As the tip of the neck had been cut and inserted approximately 1 cm into the neck and soldered with silver to work comfortably remove all its parts. Then I restored the tip to its original position, restored all the parts again and took the opportunity to close the record and give pipe 1.5 mms of opening where the pad closes and produced an internal cone to 3 mm at the end of the tube.

 I said the pad, I tried multiphonic undesirable outcome and was gone, the pitch of the sax was balanced and all it sounds better than before.

 Conclusion: And here it fits perfectly your comment. This is for those just beginning and those who have not learned the correct embouchure on a sax. When tuning problems have very high or inconsistent in its saxophone, first check if your mouthpiece, reeds, ligature are in relation to the instrument and examine whether they are doing things right on the mouth and do not leave in the hands reckless arrangement or reform their instruments, because the result will be like the issue I brought to the forum.
 There will be problems of unknown origin, very hard to find raising the cost of the arrangements by the time it takes to test all the variables and find a correct solution.

 Thank you for your interest and fraternal greetings
 Silverio

I understand exactly what you are referring to - note stability, clarity, ease of attack, in the second/upper register of the normal range.  This is a rather complicated issue.  From the second register on, the air column&#39;s second mode resonance lies above the instrument&#39;s cut-off frequency, so it can not contribute to the sounding regime.  Simply put, the resonant frequency of the mouthpiece and that of the reed must be so arranged that the embouchure pressure which provides the correct playing frequency, also places the reed&#39;s own (easily manipulated) resonance in the position where it can take the place of that missing from the air column.  Additionally, the player must be aware and have the sensitivity to be able to make the minute and instantaneous embouchure/vocal tract adjustments that take advantage of the available reed resonance.

>The configuration for the larynx or oral tract is a learned habit by practicing the overtone series or bugle call tones based on the low notes of the saxophone.  This leads to good response and better intonation on the altissimo notes as opposed to just biting the reed and blowing.

>In order to play the altissimos, the player MUST configure the oral tract to reinforce one of the partials being sounded. This is absolutely essential to playing altissimos, since the tube will at that point does not have the impedance peaks to force the reed to vibrate at the desired frequency. And the damping of the reed must also be adjusted with the embouchure, and the attack needs to be finessed.

All the rest needs to be built through commitment and practice that are extended in time, a fact whose awareness is probably neglected by those players who are constantly looking for another mouthpiece. Hopefully some will get to this simple truth through experience,

>>>Well.... this is my opinion about the high notes on a saxophone, most players that have the problem with altissimo register is &#39;cause they really don&#39;t know how to play altissimo, if you are practicing a scale let say C and you only practice 2 octaves and later try to play any note on the next high octave the notes will not play, why???? because you don&#39;t have trained for playing high notes, I think that the most important training of a sax player is overtones but the problem it&#39;s more complex than practicing only overtones.The problem start with the player bocal and dental alignment with the mp, and the mp have the problem to match the reed, in some way that matches the mouth of the player, the flow of air to play have to be consistent with the pressure in the mouth and the opening of the reed with the mouthpiece. I think that one big problem for a player it&#39;s belive that a mouthpiece may sound or play better than other mouthpiece, we are looking all
 time for facings and ma thematics to solve something that depends from a lot of variables, you can&#39;t issolate a problem that changes everyday (reed and the player&#39;s mouth and air ). And to be honest the problem to not have the ability to play high notes depends from a lot of small problems becoming one big problem.
