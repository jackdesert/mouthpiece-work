I was just wondering if anyone has had success with these blanks.  
Got a couple yesterday (nice job, Keith!) and was wondering how you 
others decided to tackle the project.  I&#39;m thinking of getting the 
table and lay to a playable state (with minimal baffle work).  Once I 
can blow a few notes, I&#39;ll start hogging out the baffle or modifying 
the facing as needed.

I may find I&#39;ll need different tools than I&#39;ve used for HR blanks or 
simply tweaking a metal lay.  This will be a rewarding exercise in 
patience, I think.  Especially considering I don&#39;t have a mill or any 
precision powertools other than a Dremel (only as precise as I am 
with my hands) and a really old drill press.

If anyone has pictures of their final results (other than what might 
be posted), it would be interesting to see where you all went with it.

FYI, I posted some generic steps I thought were needed to finish 
these blanks back in message # 2442.

Other than Keith, I was the only other person to post what I did on 
the metal tenor blanks back in message #2605. Has anyone else got 
something that plays? I have not seen any posts with what others have 
done... I have to admit, I have not done much with it lately--been 
kind of busy with other things. As Keith mentioned, the bore on the 
shank needs to be shaved a bit. I cannot get the mouthpiece down the 
neck very well. Also, the baffle needs to be brought down a bit.  I 
agree with Keith that the piece sounds a little bright for me as 
well. As for a ligature, I have used a standard Rovner rubber soprano 
1RVS and it fits quite well.

We&#39;ll I&#39;m a damn good sax repairmen, but I suck at mouthpiece work,
I completely messed up my piece, It&#39;s  a nice paper weight.
I&#39;ll leave the mouthpiece work to the expects and stick with 
repairing the horns.  You make the mouthpiece sound great and I&#39;ll 
do the same for the horn.
Can&#39;t be good at everything.
