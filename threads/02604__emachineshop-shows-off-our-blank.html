I gave eMachineShop permission to post a pic of our blank on their 
site.  I figured we were already somewhat public with it via the 
MPWork site.  It also gave me some leverage to get replies to a few 
questions I had about my eMachineShop experiance.  I was in Email 
contact with their president.
