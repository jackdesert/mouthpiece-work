Hi Steve
 
I have just posted a request for a tip gauge price and shipping to Australia
on the Mouthpiece web site .
 
Would you also have a set of feeler gauges for mouthpiece work?  I am unable
to get a set the go past 35 thou over here.
Jeff Rosner has them but can&#39;t do Pay Pal with a credit card.
 
If you can supply the tip gauge and the feeler gauges, please advise total
cost incl shipping.
 
thanks
 
Ross McIntyre
