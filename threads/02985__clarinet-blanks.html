Hello,

I am developing a new clarinet mouthpiece and it is ready to be 
produced.  As a result, I have about 30 prototypes that would be 
great for practice--pieces that wouldn&#39;t be damaged by completely 
messing them up.  I&#39;m willing to let them go very cheaply.  Just let 
me know if you&#39;re interested.

Ben

  Hello,

  I am developing a new clarinet mouthpiece and it is ready to be 
  produced.  As a result, I have about 30 prototypes that would be 
  great for practice--pieces that wouldn&#39;t be damaged by completely 
  messing them up.  I&#39;m willing to let them go very cheaply.  Just let 
  me know if you&#39;re interested.

I would be interested too to try a couple. If you start producing 
these blanks how many will be available lets say per month. What are 
they made of. Why do you call them practice pieces. Are they not 
capable of being made in to a great MP?
