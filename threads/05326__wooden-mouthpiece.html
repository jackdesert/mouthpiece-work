This is a question more likely to be discussed on SOTW. But here&#39;s a 
few cents worth anyway.  Francois Louis works very slowly and 
meticuliously to exacting standards so his mouthpieces take about a 
month to complete. They are almost never available commercially which 
also drives the price to the stratosphere. I have seen his very unique 
metal mouthpieces sell for over $2000.  He has also created a very 
unique double soprano saxophone or aulophone.

  Not having the tip rail too thin helps, too.  If the tip rail is too thin or narrow, the mouthpiece can chirp.  If the tip rail is too wide, the mouthpiece plays sluggishly, that is, poor response.
   
  Also the facing curve.  Be careful that you don&#39;t have too much curvature at the tip rail. As I get right to the tip, and see that as I draw the mouthpiece across the cutting paper, the pattern left on the paper goes from two lines (the side rails) to a full width mark (the tip rail) STOP LIFTING the butt end of the mouthpiece!  Having that little "flip" on the very tip  of the tip rail can introduce a chirp and also resistance.  The reed can&#39;t seal well there.
   
  And some reeds just don&#39;t work with some mouthpieces.  Why, I don&#39;t know.  For example, a friend sent a nice RIA metal bari sax mouthpiece to me to work on.  He had a really bad chirping problem, so I had him send his reeds, too.   They were Vandoren Traditional ("blue box").
   
  As I was testing his mouthpiece, and chirping and squeeking badly, my wife called from the other room, "I have NEVER heard you sound that bad... you sound like a beginner."
   
  I tried a few other brands of reeds, all of which worked better.  And best was the Fibracell bari reed.  I sent the mouthpiece back with no work done on it and charged only for two Fibracell bari reeds, which I packed with the mouthpiece.  The customer was thrilled.
   
  This was not just any customer... he is not only a fine repairman, but also has toured with a world class big band.  You don&#39;t send such a player home with the advice, "Kid, you need more practice."  Something was wrong, and in this case, it was the reeds used.  
   
  Oddly, those same reeds worked well with another mouthpiece.  But that particular combination, that RIA metal and those reeds just did not work together.

I have found that lowering the baffle near the tip rail helps to reduce
chirps.  So in creating your roll-over, if you are actually making the
baffle higher by lowering the table and opening the tip, that is the
opposite of what I have observed.  But if you are just taking material away
from the tip to make the roll over, you may be lowering the baffle there.

  Good fit of the tip rail to the contour of the tip of the reed is one thing.
   
  Not having the tip rail too thin helps, too.  If the tip rail is too thin or narrow, the mouthpiece can chirp.  If the tip rail is too wide, the mouthpiece plays sluggishly, that is, poor response.
   
  Also the facing curve.  Be careful that you don&#39;t have too much curvature at the tip rail. As I get right to the tip, and see that as I draw the mouthpiece across the cutting paper, the pattern left on the paper goes from two lines (the side rails) to a full width mark (the tip rail) STOP LIFTING the butt end of the mouthpiece!  Having that little "flip" on the very tip  of the tip rail can introduce a chirp and also resistance.  The reed can&#39;t seal well there.
   
  And some reeds just don&#39;t work with some mouthpieces.  Why, I don&#39;t know.  For example, a friend sent a nice RIA metal bari sax mouthpiece to me to work on.  He had a really bad chirping problem, so I had him send his reeds, too.   They were Vandoren Traditional ("blue box").
   
  As I was testing his mouthpiece, and chirping and squeeking badly, my wife called from the other room, "I have NEVER heard you sound that bad... you sound like a beginner."
   
  I tried a few other brands of reeds, all of which worked better.  And best was the Fibracell bari reed.  I sent the mouthpiece back with no work done on it and charged only for two Fibracell bari reeds, which I packed with the mouthpiece.  The customer was thrilled.
   
  This was not just any customer... he is not only a fine repairman, but also has toured with a world class big band.  You don&#39;t send such a player home with the advice, "Kid, you need more practice."  Something was wrong, and in this case, it was the reeds used.  
   
  Oddly, those same reeds worked well with another mouthpiece.  But that particular combination, that RIA metal and those reeds just did not work together.

Yes... but a "flip" on the tip is even more than just continuing the facing curve.  It is done by picking up the end of the mouthpiece too fast as the last bit of tip is touching.

Is this also the reason to make a radial curved facing slightly more 
elliptical?
i.e. creating a "flat spot" toward the tip rail to allow a larger 
radius curve towards the tip.

Or is the "flat spot" more of a preference in the facing?

Thanks,

Ted

            <pre class='message__body'>What happens is this...
   
  As you raise the end of the mouthpiece, while approaching the tip, even if you do so at a constant rate, and you roll off of the side rails and onto the tip rail, you are suddenly applying the same force to less and less area.  So, the rate of cutting is increased as that last portion in the middle of the tip rail is sanded.  
   
  I stop raising the end of the mouthpiece the moment the sandpaper shows the entire tip rail is being cut.  That is, the tracks on the paper go from two lines (the side rails) to a full width shading.  I watch for that very carefully.
   
  And this allows the reed to close off the entire tip rail at once, instead of from the corners inward.

Is this also the reason to make a radial curved facing slightly more elliptical?
i.e. creating a "flat spot" toward the tip rail to allow a larger radius curve towards the tip.

Or is the "flat spot" more of a preference in the facing?

Thanks,

Ted

Yes... but a "flip" on the tip is even more than just continuing the facing curve.  It is done by picking up the end of the mouthpiece too fast as the last bit of tip is touching.

   Good fit of the tip rail to the contour of the tip of the reed is one thing.
  
   
   
   Not having the tip rail too thin helps, too.  If the tip rail is too thin or narrow, the mouthpiece can chirp.  If the tip rail is too wide, the mouthpiece plays sluggishly, that is, poor response.
  
   
   
   Also the facing curve.  Be careful that you don&#39;t have too much curvature at the tip rail. As I get right to the tip, and see that as I draw the mouthpiece across the cutting paper, the pattern left on the paper goes from two lines (the side rails) to a full width mark (the tip rail) STOP LIFTING the butt end of the mouthpiece!  Having that little "flip" on the very tip  of the tip rail can introduce a chirp and also resistance.  The reed can&#39;t seal well there.
  
   
   
   And some reeds just don&#39;t work with some mouthpieces.  Why, I don&#39;t know.  For example, a friend sent a nice RIA metal bari sax mouthpiece to me to work on.  He had a really bad chirping problem, so I had him send his reeds, too.   They were Vandoren Traditional ("blue box").
  
   
   
   As I was testing his mouthpiece, and chirping and squeeking badly, my wife called from the other room, "I have NEVER heard you sound that bad... you sound like a beginner."
  
   
   
   I tried a few other brands of reeds, all of which worked better.  And best was the Fibracell bari reed.  I sent the mouthpiece back with no work done on it and charged only for two Fibracell bari reeds, which I packed with the mouthpiece.  The customer was thrilled.
  
   
   
   This was not just any customer... he is not only a fine repairman, but also has toured with a world class big band.  You don&#39;t send such a player home with the advice, "Kid, you need more practice."  Something was wrong, and in this case, it was the reeds used.  
  
   
   
   Oddly, those same reeds worked well with another mouthpiece.  But that particular combination, that RIA metal and those reeds just did not work together.

   I&#39;ve got a mystery that just really haunts me.  The mouthpieces that I like the best are very loud and edgy - when I work on a piece I like to get that baffle to be perfectly straight right out to the tip (like the CNC guardala pieces do).  But when I do that, they almost always chirp unless I give them a slight rollover right behind the tip.  I&#39;m not talking about a lot of rollover (like the lawtons) and certainly not the HUGE amount of rollover like a Selmer - just a small hint of a rollover seems to be able to tame the chirp.  But I don&#39;t see any evidence of any rollover at all on the guardalas I&#39;ve examined.  So how did he get those to not chirp or is that the perfect symetry of CNC at work?  Is there some little trick I&#39;m missing?

Nearly all elliptical facings are more curved at the tip and less at the
table.

In my experiance, a slight flip is preferred over a flat section at the tip
rail.  Altissimo response is better.  But if you are having chirp problems,
a flatter tip rail can be tried.
