This is a question more likely to be discussed on SOTW. But here&#39;s a 
few cents worth anyway.  Francois Louis works very slowly and 
meticuliously to exacting standards so his mouthpieces take about a 
month to complete. They are almost never available commercially which 
also drives the price to the stratosphere. I have seen his very unique 
metal mouthpieces sell for over $2000.  He has also created a very 
unique double soprano saxophone or aulophone.

I have found that lowering the baffle near the tip rail helps to reduce
chirps.  So in creating your roll-over, if you are actually making the
baffle higher by lowering the table and opening the tip, that is the
opposite of what I have observed.  But if you are just taking material away
from the tip to make the roll over, you may be lowering the baffle there.

Is this also the reason to make a radial curved facing slightly more 
elliptical?
i.e. creating a "flat spot" toward the tip rail to allow a larger 
radius curve towards the tip.

Or is the "flat spot" more of a preference in the facing?

Thanks,

Ted

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: chirps</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>What happens is this...
   
  As you raise the end of the mouthpiece, while approaching the tip, even if you do so at a constant rate, and you roll off of the side rails and onto the tip rail, you are suddenly applying the same force to less and less area.  So, the rate of cutting is increased as that last portion in the middle of the tip rail is sanded.  
   
  I stop raising the end of the mouthpiece the moment the sandpaper shows the entire tip rail is being cut.  That is, the tracks on the paper go from two lines (the side rails) to a full width shading.  I watch for that very carefully.
   
  And this allows the reed to close off the entire tip rail at once, instead of from the corners inward.

Yes... but a "flip" on the tip is even more than just continuing the facing curve.  It is done by picking up the end of the mouthpiece too fast as the last bit of tip is touching.

   Good fit of the tip rail to the contour of the tip of the reed is one thing.
  
   
   
   Not having the tip rail too thin helps, too.  If the tip rail is too thin or narrow, the mouthpiece can chirp.  If the tip rail is too wide, the mouthpiece plays sluggishly, that is, poor response.
  
   
   
   Also the facing curve.  Be careful that you don&#39;t have too much curvature at the tip rail. As I get right to the tip, and see that as I draw the mouthpiece across the cutting paper, the pattern left on the paper goes from two lines (the side rails) to a full width mark (the tip rail) STOP LIFTING the butt end of the mouthpiece!  Having that little "flip" on the very tip  of the tip rail can introduce a chirp and also resistance.  The reed can&#39;t seal well there.
  
   
   
   And some reeds just don&#39;t work with some mouthpieces.  Why, I don&#39;t know.  For example, a friend sent a nice RIA metal bari sax mouthpiece to me to work on.  He had a really bad chirping problem, so I had him send his reeds, too.   They were Vandoren Traditional ("blue box").
  
   
   
   As I was testing his mouthpiece, and chirping and squeeking badly, my wife called from the other room, "I have NEVER heard you sound that bad... you sound like a beginner."

Nearly all elliptical facings are more curved at the tip and less at the
table.

In my experiance, a slight flip is preferred over a flat section at the tip
rail.  Altissimo response is better.  But if you are having chirp problems,
a flatter tip rail can be tried.

You won&#39;t need anything out of the ordinary for your wooden mouthpiece: a
perfectly level surface to level the table, a standard mouthpiece gauge and
feelers for the facing curve, assorted small fine tooth files, assorted
grades of emery paper, and a digital caliper. You can do some one stop
