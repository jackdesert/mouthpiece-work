            <pre class='message__body'>My experiance is mostly with sax moutpieces.  Sax MP experiances do not
translate well to clarinet MPs.  I think thinning the tip rail makes the MP
more responsive and just a little bit brighter.  Ultra thin tip rails can
sound edgy.  Some say that thick tip rails can be less squeak prone. 
Possibly the thick rail allows a beginner to play with sloppy reed
alignment.

Vandoren is thinking. If you take material off just behind the tip
rail you can smooth that afterward with some fine sandpaper (maybe
start with 800 grit, then go to 1200 and even 2000). After you finish
sanding the lay and rails you can use 2000 grit to get a nice polish.
Basically if they are a little rough it won&#39;t affect the playability.

Though a broad tip rail is aesthetically repellent to the trained eye,
it does not seem to me to have any other drawbacks. It is versatile.
Possible pluses :-  it allows the continued use of a softish reed by
moving nearer the tip.
 Less chance of beginners breaking the tip if it is kept back from the
edge.
 No need to narrow the tip, just pull back the reed to the inner edge,
this will simulate a narrow tip. 
It will also allow a harder reed to respond more easily.
These variations give altered blowing responses. Just pick the one you
want.

 
All these permutations

Incidentally, I just bought a Vandoren B45 "Lyre", and the tip and
side rails are much thicker than on my regular B45.  Perhaps their
manufacturing is becoming a little inconsistent.  At any rate, the new
mouthpiece (B45 Lyre) is very stuffy and somewhat unresponsive -
Hardly what I expected from what is essentially a B45 with a slightly
wider tip opening.
