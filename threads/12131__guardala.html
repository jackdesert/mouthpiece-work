            <pre class='message__body'>I’m after a little advice on what appears to be a hand made Guardala Tenor piece that has come my way. I have my own opinion on whether or not it is authentic and would value the advice of our group.
 It has a 110thou  tip opening. The tip rail appears to be wider than other hand mades that I.ve encounted. DG is noted for doing thin tip rails.
 It has a 25.8 mm length of lay at the 1.5 thou feeler.
 It has a small chamber with a ring at the end of the shank leading in to the chamber. It has a long fairly high baffle that is similar to an MB2.
 The ramp between the baffle and the chamber is very concave and not convex as in every other one that I have encountered.
 The file marks across the baffle are finer than every other hand made that I have encountered. 
 This plece plays ok with great harmonics. It does not have that huge sound that all the other Guardalas are noted for, probably because of the small chamber.
 I bought a Studio new when they came out and 2 MB’s when they came out. I have since bought a Laser trimmedMB2 and also worked on a clients King. All of these pieces had the ramp leading down to a huge .smooth round chamber that flowed in to the shank.
 Any advice would be appreciated.   Thanks.
