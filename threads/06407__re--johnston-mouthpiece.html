            <pre class='message__body'>Hi fellas - I&#39;m also following this thread, as I have a Bb Clar   
Johnston-Selmer, New York [in script] mp, with 32109 along-side  [right] of the table, 
inherited with a late &#39;30s G M Bundy [American Selmer]  good wood cl,  The "wind 
cut" opening is 32 mm in length, so ?isthe curve  16 mm in length?.  I am 
assuming the 109 is tip opening, and its playing  characteristics are much like 
my Selmer HS, not my favorite.  I have.  however. resisted my impulse to 
open/lengthen the lay. Will be interested in any  info, could it be a Ched??  Don
