I&#39;ve used crazy glue in order to build up a roll-over baffle, where not
much thickness needs to be added; also to build up the edge of a baffle
insert in order to make it wedge more tightly or more forward in some
mouthpieces; and also to slightly fill in the "ditch" behind the tip rail
in the Rico Graftonite mpc&#39;s.

I don&#39;t find it&#39;s particularly easy material to apply evenly. It can be
thinned with acetone though.

If the area being treated is not level, the glue will flow before
hardening towards the low side, creating uneven thickness. I sit a
mouthpiece on a chunk of wall-tack when applying it, and use a
keychain-size small bubble level to level the mouthpiece table from
side-to-side. I&#39;ve done end-to-end leveling by eye - although now that I
think about it, if I had a perfectly rectangular small piece of plastic to
rest on the baffle, I could sit the bubble level on it, in order to get
things even end-to-end.
