            <pre class='message__body'>Good day fellow refacers
 

 

 

 What is your alternative for needle files can you suggest for shaping the baffle? 
 

 I researched online and saw some suggested tools but I have a hard time looking for them on auto stores and or supply shops.
 

 I saw some square/rectangle-shaped needle files with cut #00 on the suggested article. But what I just saw here that is available is a triangular one that states 4" or 6" without stating the cut #...How can I determine if it is #00 or cut #02? 
 

 

 Thank you

            <pre class='message__body'>I find cut 0 the best all-around cut.  I have one 2 cut in half round that is useful for fine finish work.  I have a few 00 cuts for when I need to remove a lot of material.

I do not have any triangle shapes.  Just half round, barrette, flat and and square.

 and order the catalog.  (click at top left of the page)  Don't just search for things online.  You can't very well search for something you don't know exists.  

Micromark has a lot of tools for model builders that are equally useful for mouthpiece work and instrument repair, jewelry making, and other crafts.
