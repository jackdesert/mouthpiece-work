            <pre class='message__body'>Go back in the posted messages and read the thread about dental 
acrylic.  I believe the short version is:

- Regular epoxy works great, but there are unresolved toxicity issues
- Dental epoxy is expensive and requires light curing (possibly other 
equipment), but is durable, stable & safe
- Dental acrylic is not too expensive (and no special equipment needed) 
and will chemically bond to plastics, for a durable patch.  It files and 
polishes very easily.  I have had problems with it adhering to hard 
rubber (I fixed some large chips on hard rubber mouthpieces, and the 
acrylic section does not seem to bond to the hard rubber).  Again, it 
should be completely safe.

There are links to dental supply catalogs in those old messages as 
well.  Hope this helps.
