            <pre class='message__body'>I only played one, which belonged to a buddy of mine. It was pretty bright,
like a Dukoff or Lakey. It had a high baffle with two different break
points, sort of like a Runyon Bionix. The chamber was medium sized. It was
responsive and even in all registers, but too bright for my taste. Very nice
workmanship. I didn&#39;t measure it, but seemed to be an average facing length
and medium open tip.

Steve,

     I have been checking out Eric&#39;s products for a bit now. I am curious:
how would you categorize the sound ? Are they like a Meyer ? a link ?
brighter ? darker ? different ?
