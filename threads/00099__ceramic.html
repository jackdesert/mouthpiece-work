            <pre class='message__body'>SOTW --discussion forum had a response to your question, but I have not been 
able to locate the posting.  As I remember, the acceptance of the ceramic 
mouthpiece was nothing too exciting.  An "ocarina" is made out of ceramic (or 
clay).  Ceramic "casting" is fairly easy to use in manufacturing.  Machining 
ceramics is another story.

The theory behind; Ceramic, Crystal and Pure Carbon is interesting. These 
materials, are supposed to be neutral to the sound and not deaden the sound.  
They do not absorb some overtones, like in using copper or wood material.

All to create a market.  I personally would think that a mouthpiece made out 
of OWL DUNG could have its place!

would
