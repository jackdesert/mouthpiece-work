Any thoughts on this schedule for an HR Otto Link? Would this work 
on a STM? 

.0015 -  46
.010  -  36
.024  -  26
.034  -  20
.050  -  14
tip 220 mm

Thanks

does this make a big difference? (35.5 instead of 36 on .010 and 20.75 instead of 20 on .034)

            <pre class='message__body'>Some say yes, some say no.  I think it may have to do with your embouchure and 
reed choice.  If you are only going to use a set of 5 feeler gages, there are 
probably going to be other differences of this magnitude that are missed with 
this system.

            <pre class='message__body'>No, this makes a small difference. What difference in sound and response it makes will be noticed by some players, not by others, and which of these curves is preferable is largely a matter of taste.
