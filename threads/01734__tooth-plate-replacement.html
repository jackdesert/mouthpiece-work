I do not know of a place you can buy a replacement.  Possibly Babbitt.

I repair/replace these using 2-part black Acrylic by 3M.  Some report 
making them out of junk HR mouthpieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>I never thought of an old HR mouthpiece! and this black Acrylic 
technique sound very interesting, I need to learn a lot!! :-(

I did made a piece from the back cover of one of my CDs, It came out 
looking realy good.

The bad news is, I used super glue, it came off while I was washing 
the mouthpiece with soap and water, then tried to stick it back 
using UHU, this didn&#39;t even sitck. what should I use?.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m using 3M DP-810 black.  I got it through McMaster-Carr, but they are
currently only listing the green.  I did not get a dispenser gun.  I made a
gizmo out of 2 dowels to squeeze out what I need.

There is a lot of info on the 3M site:

(avoid the 4.3Mb pdf flyer, the same info is on the low res one below it).
