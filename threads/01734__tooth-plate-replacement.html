I do not know of a place you can buy a replacement.  Possibly Babbitt.

making them out of junk HR mouthpieces.

I did made a piece from the back cover of one of my CDs, It came out 
looking realy good.

The bad news is, I used super glue, it came off while I was washing 
the mouthpiece with soap and water, then tried to stick it back 
using UHU, this didn&#39;t even sitck. what should I use?.
