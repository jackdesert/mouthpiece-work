            <pre class='message__body'>I stopped by a few shops with drawings with a spec. sheet and dwg. 
today, and this should be possible. One possibility is the minimum 
set that you can&#39;t get in a standard automotive set:

.050	.093
.063	.109
.078	.125

...if anyone has a good reason to change any of these thicknesses, 
please vote now, before I commit to a batch...

At one of the shops, I met a horn player who was interested, and he 
suggested that he can buy individual feelers from his jobber up 
to .040. He could make the thicker ones to match the profile and I 
could get sets that included everything (even an extra .0015). This 
would be a little more money, but not twice as much. (I don&#39;t have a 
hard quote yet, but I got the sense that if I bought >50 pieces that 
$25 for the minimum and $40 for the full set might be doable. Maybe a 
little more if I only bought 25 sets.

I&#39;d be interested in hearing a vote...if there is no overwhelming 
input, I will probably commission and make available the minimum 6-
blade set in a 3" X 1/2" format. They should be very nice, and this 
second guy offered to label them, as he has a little laser marking 
system. I&#39;m going to push him to keep it where I can break even 
delivering these to SOTW types at $25 incl. USPS Priority. He 
mentioned he might even trade some sax repair work for some of the 
cost, which I would gladly do.

I would be interested in a set of feelers.  All sizes 
(.0015, .010, .024, .034, .050. .063, .078, .093, .109, .125)

      I have the first 5 from a set I bought at an automotive 
store.  However, the .034 & .050 I had to make by bolting two 
different ones together. It would most likely be more accurate to 
have solid (one piece) feelers in all sizes.

       The Erick Brand set is great for small tip openings, but...
Great that someone else thought of this!!!

     $40, or more... I&#39;m not all that concirned about the price...

  Let me know if I can get a Full set.

            <pre class='message__body'>Great work Jeff.  I could go either way on the sets, but the .050"-.125"
set of 6 fills the biggest void I/we currently have.  

I still would prefer Stainless Steel as I has a SS set up to .025" in SS
now (~$15 from McMaster-Carr).  Of course, I would need a SS feeler around
.033"-.036" too to make a complete set.  I&#39;ve seen .031" in SS but its a
tad small to cover the gap.   But SS is more difficult to machine and would
probably cost more, so it may not be a good value for everyone.  The
dungeon I work in is a little damp.

How good will these feeler be for parallel surfaces?

This is stainless steel:

They can cut to length for an order...

Let&#39;s compare notes before you order anything...the ones I&#39;m setting

should look and decide if it is worth the price.

I will send email with a special offer to those who &#39;committed&#39; to

get some cash back quickly), and then figure out what I have to sell 
the rest for to recover my cash.

Just for the record...I&#39;m getting 50 sets of these made...I should 
have them about the 3rd week of April...

I will send email with a special offer to those who &#39;committed&#39; to 
buying a set when I get them (you folks encouraged me, and I need to 
get some cash back quickly), and then figure out what I have to sell 
the rest for to recover my cash.

thanx, jeff

I think its OK for you to make a few bucks on it too.  You are not going to
get wealthy off of such a niche market, but you should stay in the black!

Sound like you will sell ~25 fairly quickly and the rest will trickle out. 
I&#39;ll give you some press on the site home page for the occassional visitor.

  This is a great thing you are doing for our community Jeff.  

  I think its OK for you to make a few bucks on it too.  You are not going to
  get wealthy off of such a niche market, but you should stay in the black!

  Sound like you will sell ~25 fairly quickly and the rest will trickle out.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Jeff and group,
I hope I&#39;m not stepping on your toes here, but your feeler sets didn&#39;t
match up with my sizes... I use
.002,.005,.008,.014,.020,.026,.038,.050,.062,.080,.098 for sanity&#39;s sake.
I just ordered my set from Eastman. Now they only do Stainless up to
.025 but I will at least be eliminating "gap-osis" with the taped
together set I have now. 
Real nice folks - a little spendy but I figure lifetime investment.
