The Link may need a slightly softer reed, or the
baffle may be a little too high.  Also, did you check
to see if the table is flat?

            <pre class='message__body'>If needed, use Teflon tape on the cork so you can pull it out farther to
get it in tune.

I do not think this is a facing issue.  Intonation problems are usually due
to too wide a tip opening or a chamber volume problem.  A Link 5* should
have neither of these problems.  Having to pull the Link out indicates that
the chamber volume may be too small.  But Links are larger than average.

See if the problem is the same when playing the Link on other tenors.  Also
see if other players can play the Link on their sax and yours.  This may
provide more insight as to the nature of the problem.
