            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,
I am starting out measuring tenor pieces and taking the measurements I
get from pieces that play great first as I think they will set a
"standard" set of lay readings for me. 

- I am finding that the majority of my first 5 mpc&#39;s are nearly
identical (lay-wise). Do you find this to be the case?
- Holding that damn glass gauge - thinking about creating a jig that
would support mpc. What is your method?
- Any reference for characteristcs? i.e. flat sounding needs more
baffle etc...
- Are the feelers supposed to fit flat against the glass or just let
them drop down?
- Do you just estimate the start of the lay as the .002 is pretty
small but not the exact start of the taper?

This is FUN!!! And I found a hobby that doesn&#39;t require a garage to house.
Thanks to all.
Patrick

No.  What are your 5 pieces?

It is difficult if the table is convex.  The glass gage then wants to 
pivot on a high spot.  You end up trying to stop it by using a lot of 
thumb force.  This can happen some with flat tables too.  I find it 
more comfortable if I use the fleshy part of my thumb on the glass 
gage like a ligature would hold a reed.

Just drips and drabs here and there.  No great reference that has it 
all.

Keep measuring.  You should pick a piece you like and clone its 
features into a piece you do not like.  But you will need to find 
some pieces that measure differently.

You&#39;ll get a slightly different reading each way.  Just be 
consistant.  I prefer flat against the glass.

It is fairly conventional that when a lay length is stated, it is the 
point where the .0015" feeler measures.  A .002" would measure about 
1 number (.5mm) shorter.  I think a few manufactures do state facing 
lengths to the tangent of the table and the facing.  Just as a few 
state tip openings at the very tip of the piece instead of inside the 
tip rail.  Vandoren is one.

When I started, all my stuff fitted easily inside a brief case.  This 
made it easy to clean up and set up anywhere.
