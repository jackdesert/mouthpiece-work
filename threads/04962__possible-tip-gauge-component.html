component in a homebrew tip measuring gauge? Seems cheap enough.

            <pre class='message__body'>A 3" base would only give 1 1/2" out to one side, which is 37 mm.  With a typical tenor facing of 22 mm length, that gives only 37 - 22 = 15 mm to put on the table of the mpce.  For bari that would be 37 - 25 = 12 mm.  Just not enough...
   
  I don&#39;t think a 4" base is enough either.
   
  BUT this is certainly going in the right direction!  Perhaps a piece of barstock could be attached in such a way to extend over?

            <pre class='message__body'>The main problem I see with it is that it is only a 3" long base.  I think
you need a 6" long base so there is 3" on each side of the probe.  This is
needed for bari and tenor mouthpieces.  

I think it would be a little unwieldy taking measurements too.
