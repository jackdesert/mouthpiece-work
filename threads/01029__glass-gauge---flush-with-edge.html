            <pre class='message__body'>I just received the Babbit glass gauge. The packing slip indicates 
flush with edge. The "0" line is 2.5mm from the edge. Is this the way 
it&#39;s supposed to be, or did they send the wrong gauge?

            <pre class='message__body'>Mine is 3.5 mm from the edge.  But a flush gage should be 0mm from the
edge.

The last time I ordered one I specified a narrow gage and they sent me a
wide one.  I just kept it since it was not a big enough deal to me at the time.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

Thanks for the reply.

My gauge is 2.5cm wide. Is this the wide or narrow gauge? I didn&#39;t 
specify when I ordered, and wasn&#39;t asked which I wanted.

Bill

            <pre class='message__body'>2.5cm = ~1" = the wide gage.  They do not sell all combinations of narrow/wide, flush/set-back, but I do not know which is not available.
