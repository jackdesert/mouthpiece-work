            <pre class='message__body'>Interesting ( homemade?) composite black material that blends very well with Hard Rubber color , But what is it exactly, is it now commercially available?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have never found a suitable material for tip repair of a hard rubber mouthpiece.  Any repair 
has been temporary at best.

The problems are:

1.  Hard rubber is not a very strong material to begin with.  I am sure any of you who have 
done woodwork have seen instances of a "failed glue joint" that the glue did not fail at all, 
but the wood on either side failed.  The glue is far stronger than the wood.  This is often 
the case with hard rubber.

2.  The surface area to be glued is very small in relation to the size of the piece to be 
glued back on.  The leverage of the glued on part when bumped in either direction easily 
breaks the glue joint, which then is in tension, not shear, and not compression.  That is, 
the joint is pulled apart.
