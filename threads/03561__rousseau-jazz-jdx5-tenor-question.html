            <pre class='message__body'>I recently purchased an E. Rousseau Jazz JDX5 tenor piece. It was
advertised as being new.

I currently play on a Link STM 7 with a fibercell 3.

I measure the tip opening I&#39;m getting a reading of .100. The
mouthpiece comparison chart I looked at says that it should be a .095.
The same mouthpiece chart says that my link 7 should measure .100 but
it measures .096 when I measure it.

I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has a Rousseau Jazz JDX5 and could let me
know what the tip opening is.

I&#39;m a little worried that someone may have opened this piece up. So
far, I can barely get a single note out of it. I&#39;ve tried a 3.5, 3,
and a 2.5 fibercell and can&#39;t get a note with any of those reeds.

When I first opened the box and tried to play it, it had a strong
smell like when you file down a rubber mpc. When I look at the side
rails it looks like they &#39;spread out&#39; some as they approach the tip. I
don&#39;t know if that&#39;s normal or not. When I get home tonight, if my
Internet is working, I&#39;ll try to put some pics up.

I also posted this on SOTW but figured I post here as well.

            <pre class='message__body'>I take it from the lack of response that the Rousseau JDX are not very
popular with players on this forum. I sent an email to E. Rousseau
himself and was very surprised and happy that within half an hour I
got a response from him.

He apologized for any problems with the piece and told me to ship it
to him and he would check it out and send me a new one. He also said
he would reimburse me for the shipping.

I&#39;ll probably send it to him tomorrow and I will post the results when
I get the new piece.

Cass.

            <pre class='message__body'>There are only 500 members registered in the group.  Of these, perhaps only
50-100 read the message posts.  Odds are, you are the only one of them with
a JDX5 tenor MP.

            <pre class='message__body'>Link STM 7 should be .100, but range is .095 - .105 in reality.
