able to measure the shape of the baffle and/or more in general the 
shape of the floor of a mouthpiece. It can be useful if you wnat to 
make exact copies of your vintage preferred mouthpieces ;). I usually 
start from the bottom of the "U" shaped window moving up to the tip 
rail with steps in the range: 1mm to 0.5 mm or even lees in the places 
where I need more accuracy. It works fine but requires time and of 
course a PC to plot and analyze experimental data (floor depth Vs 
traslation).
All the best,



Daniele

            <pre class='message__body'>About 2 years ago, I was looking at a bunch of soprano mouthpieces that  a
local dealer had (I was there to pick up a piece won on ebay).

He had a hard-rubber Otto Link with an unusual wedge-shaped chamber - the
chamber was wedged in by the side-walls; and narrowed to a somewhat
triangular-shaped throat with a vertical orientation.

It played rather well, but I hadn&#39;t planned on an extra purchase, and didn&#39;t
have the cash on hand.

I did go home and, from memory, model the chambering on a Graftonite piece I
had been modifying, using plumbers putty. When I finally got the facing and
rails done right on this piece (tonight, actually), it became one of the
better-playing soprano pieces I have right now.

But what model/vintage Link mouthpiece was it that I saw?
