            <pre class='message__body'>Ive got two BRAND NEW Saxgourmet tenor necks (the one with the built in
neck enhancer and the nodal weights) for sale:

 

(1) Slight lacquer blemish on one side, at about the placement of the pip.
Blemish spot is about ¼ inch in diameter. Its acid bleed under the lacquer

 

(2)  Sample model with gold lacquer but SILVER plated key

 

We sell lots of these for $275.Ill part with these for $150 + shipping
each. Payment via PayPal only. Tenon diameter is 27.5mm, fits Selmer,
Yamaha, Yanigasawa, many other brands. You can find out more about this
model at www.nationofmusic.com  The hard shell case is NOT included at this
price, but a velvet neck bag comes with each. 

 

If I dont sell them here, Ill probably eBay them. Measure your own tenon
to see if they will fit your horn. If you have questions, email OFF THIS
LIST to Saxgourmet@...
