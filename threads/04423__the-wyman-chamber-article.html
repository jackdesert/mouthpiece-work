            <pre class='message__body'>I bought a copy.  It wasn&#39;t cheap for what was just a bunch of printed pages but the content is worth it.

That site is now redirected to one that is a user&#39;s nightmare. 

This is a better link:

http://wwwlib.umi.com/dxweb/search 

and search on Wyman for author, and mouthpiece in title.  It&#39;s $41.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the report of the "bad" link.  It is difficult to keep up with
the maintenance of all of them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Planosax, I&#39;ve seen too... and I was interested to read it but I didnt buy.
 
 A BIG nightmare... to get the right page and price of $41.00 is for the small book than to ship is ... $44,00 or 67.00... (when stamp is a few bucks).
 For the same price I can have a sax sent to my home in Italy and... maybe a playboy girl inside a cake!

 Some of the guy who have a copy can share it giving a nice price? even if you get a part for the job, or for friendship at cost price (like I&#39;m use to do during my seminary of University) ?
 ... and give us a chance to get culture of it!

 For the one want to buy there is another link they give me:
