            <pre class='message__body'>Does anybody have experiance with Ultrasonic Cleaning?  I&#39;m wondering 
if it would work well on metal and non-metal mouthpieces without 
harming them.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use an ultrasonic cleaner for cleaning fountain pen nib sections.  The
ratio varies but typically 80 percent water and 20 percent Formula 409.  If
the pen is really gummed up then it&#39;s a 50-50 ratio.

 

I would have a concern about using an ultrasonic cleaner on mouthpieces
because of the nature of the cleaning process which could make the piece
move around a lot.  It might be safe on a low setting.  I would try it with
cheap plastic pieces.

 

What cleaning solution do you have in mind?

off calsified saliva off hard rubber without discollering the piece or
chipping it.

            <pre class='message__body'>My concern would be chipping in the ultrasonic solution if you really
cranked it up.  I think you would be o.k. at a low level of agitation
depending on how you suspended the piece.  Simply placing it in the bottom
of an ultrasonic cleaner is going to cause the piece to get battered.
Suspension within a solution is going to keep the piece from being slapped
by anything other than ultrasonic bubbles.

            <pre class='message__body'>I generally choose to just polish the stuff off. If it is really 
stubborn, I soak it in ~20% isopropyl in water, then use Hagerty&#39;s to 
lightly polish the outside. On the inside, generally I will clean up 
machine marks with wet-dry and then use hard felt glued to a 
popsickle stick with Hagerty&#39;s or Wenol if I need something stiffer. 
For really stubborn deposits, rouge or yellowstone on the felt works 
fine.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, yeah, I can get it off with WORK ;-).  I was just curious if I could
let technology do the job.

Vinegar can be used to wipe away most deposites.  But too much can discolor
most hard rubbers.
