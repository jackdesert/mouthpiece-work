  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: Brass, and Nickel


  Let&#39;s try to focus on exchanging information instead of taking jabs 
  at each other... which I like to do too. Saftey information should 
  not be a contest.

  This article indicates that about half of all brass in use contains 
  lead: 

  http://www.copper.org/innovations/1998/07/brass360.html&lt;http://www.copperorg/innovations/1998/07/brass360.html>

  It also explains that leaded brass can be machined 5X faster than non-
  leaded.

  What we need are statements from the mouthpiece manufactures as to 
  what kind of brass they use. But they may just take the stand that 
  it does not matter since their product is intended to be used with 
  plating on it.

  Does anyone know if those with Nickel allergies also have problems 
  with Chrome plating? I believe Runyon uses a lot of Chrome plating, 
  which may be a better plating than Nickel for the general public. I 
  touched up my mouthpiece using "Copy Chrome" from Caswell, which is a 
  Nickel plating made to blend in with Chrome.

Are you wondering if lead leaching out would affect the sound of a mouthpiece?

I have noticed that this subject seems to come up every now and then,
both here and on SOTW forum.  The writers suggest or have heard that
there is such a thing as vintage brass and that it is:

a) No longer available.
b) Superior in some way to "modern brass".
c) The reason why vintage instruments and / or mouthpieces sound
better, and cannot be matched by modern makers.

Does anyone have any solid facts about this topic, or is it simply a
rumour that keeps getting endlessly recycled?

Regards,
Andrew

 Ah ah ah...
 
 but let&#39;s go to talk about opinion in other blog, you wrote: 
 writers suggest or have heard... no more vintage quality brass!
 ECONOMY MAKE THE MARKET, SO PRODUCTION IS NOT GOING TO QUALITY DIRECTION.
 superior in some way...no more.
 WHICH WAY ? ALL WE KNOW NO MORE SAME HIGH QUALITY BRASS. IT WAS INTERESTING TO KNOW WHY, BUT TALKING ON THIS DAY WITH PHIL BARONE, HE TOLD ME IN HIS PRODUCTION THERE IS NOT LEAD.
 SAME AS PETER PONZOL TOLD ME LAST MONTH.
 BOTH ARE USING ANYWAY A GOLD PLATING !
 cannot be matched by modern makers...
 I AGREE FOR THE SAXOPHONE 100% TRUE!
 BUT FOR MOUTHPIECES I DONT THINK SO, I KNOW SO MANY OF THEM  MADE WITH SURGICAL STEEL AND THEY PLAY EVEN BETTER THAN BRASS VERSION... THE CUT OF A MOUTHPIECE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MATERIAL USED.
 Isn&#39;t it?

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s an urban legend. Total myth. The material does not affect the sound. So whether the alloy used in older horns is different from the alloy used in modern horns is irrelevant, not to mention that there are different alloys used in modern horns, just as there were different alloys used in vintage horns.

It would seem that if the old brass was somehow special, that it 
would be in demand for dedicated recycling for musical instrument use.

Materials do make a difference, but only if they are catually 
different materials (does that make sense...?!).

Is Platinum ever used to plate mouthpieces?  As it used for dental 
work, it would seem to stand up to the mouth as an environment and 
possibly could be an alternative to Gold Plate for those who are 
sensitive or don&#39;t like gold.
