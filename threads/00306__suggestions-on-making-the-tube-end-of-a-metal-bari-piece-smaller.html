I finally found an old Guy Hawkins baritone piece and  it plays very 
well but I want to be able to alternate it with my regular piece. My 
problem is that the end tube is a good deal larger than my neck with 
the cork I need for my regular mouthpiece. I want to find an easy way 
to reduce the inner diameter of the Hawkins piece without too much of 
a hassle otherwise I will just have to dump it. Wrapping with teflon 
etc. for each seperate usage is just too much of a hassle.. any 
suggestions are welcome.

            <pre class='message__body'>For occassional use, I have put masking tape inside the mouthpiece.  But
this becomes a mess after a few uses.

I have "painted" the inside of mouthpiece bores with epoxy.  I was using a
5-min epoxy and it went on kind of goopy.  I put on 2 coats.  I then
wrapped some sandpaper around a dowel and sanded off the epoxy "nubs" until
I got a fit on my cork.  If the dowel is to small, wrap more paper around
it or some masking tape to make it bigger.

With a creamier epoxy and some patience you could get a real nice surface. 
But since it is an "inside job" I do not think looks are that important.

Brian,
      Two suggestions:
1) Find a local machine shop that can use a mandrel and a die to swage
(squeeze down) your Hawkins shank to the smaller inside diameter needed; or
2) (This is a bit hard to do, but I&#39;ve done it) try to get a layer or two
of some sort of fairly thick and sturdy tape wrapped INSIDE your Hawkins
shank, maybe masking tape, duct tape, freezer tape.  It&#39;s tricky to do this
evenly without wrinkling the tape, and you have to be careful inserting the
mouthpiece on the neck every time to avoid catching the edge of the tape
and folding it back.  That&#39;s all that comes to mind right now -- good luck!

Nutty question but here goes.
I finally found an old Guy Hawkins baritone piece and  it plays very
well but I want to be able to alternate it with my regular piece. My
problem is that the end tube is a good deal larger than my neck with
the cork I need for my regular mouthpiece. I want to find an easy way
to reduce the inner diameter of the Hawkins piece without too much of
a hassle otherwise I will just have to dump it. Wrapping with teflon
etc. for each seperate usage is just too much of a hassle.. any
suggestions are welcome.
thanks
Brian

            <pre class='message__body'>The only "neat" solution would be to find some sort of tubing, with an
outer diameter to fit snuggley inside the Hawkins piece, and of such an
inner diameter to fit the cork as you want.

OK, here goes... get a piece of Delrin Rod from Ferree&#39;s.  Turn on a
lathe so that the OD is a good fit in the bore of the Hawkins.  Glue
this into the mouthpiece bore with CA glue.  Then bore it slowly, easily
(Delrin machines beautifully, and with no lubrication) to the desired
ID.

The real problem would be comeing up with some sort of fixture to hold
the mouthpiece steady for this operation.

            <pre class='message__body'>          In the past I have sucessfully used solid silver tubing to achieve reductions in a bore.
          If you have acces to a mandrell with a taper and diameter simmillar to the cork ( one that fits into your current mpc)
          it is easy.  Measure the diameter of both pieces , divide the difference in diameter by 2. Get tubing just a little thicker
          than this with a diameter that would allow it to go into the mpc ( the metal mpc will also function as a reducing "die"
           if you use lubrication and patience)  . Solid silver is very pliable so it will easily stretch over the mandrel if you just
           tap it with a rawhide mallet.  Sterling tube might also be used. Might need to heat it to red hot and cool slowly to soften
           it. Most of the times the fit is so good that no adhesives are needed. 
 
           Most jewellers or competent repairman should be able to do this.
