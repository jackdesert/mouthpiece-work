About Mouthpiece makers that work with rods, he forgot to mention Ken Barry (Saxscape). Ken does a superb work, I have 3 saxscape models and they all play great. Ken works mainly with Delrin rods.

About materials, I should disagree with the author. Materials DO make a difference in the sound and completely change the feel & character. Wood, Metal, Delrin, Ebonite... it&#39;s just not the same. Even between Ebonite types... why would some mouthpiece makers (like Bradford Behn) invest time & effort to search his own Ebonite formula?

Sakshama, if you are interested into making mouthpieces out of Ebonite rods, here&#39;s the address, they sell Ebonite for Berg Larsen a.o.

            <pre class='message__body'>Such an interesting subject. If you go on Youtube and just type in something like "lost wax casting" there are some really cool and detailed videos about the process of making molds for copying jewelry or small statues or other things like that. However, what seems pretty complicated to me is making a mold for a complex model like a mouthpiece, where you have to preserve the external shape and the internal chamber that would also need to be part of the mold. Theo&#39;s site had some info about how to deal with removing the original model from the mold after you form it around the mouthpiece, such as making the mold with a small dowel in the (center, I&#39;m assuming) of the chamber of the mouthpiece so that the rubber in the chamber will collapse on itself allowing you to pull the mouthpiece out of the mold after the rubber is formed around it, but it still seems pretty tricky. Plus, I guess if you were copying a mouthpiece, it might turn out a little smaller than the original. I don&#39;t know how much, but if it&#39;s 6-10% like it says on Theo&#39;s site, that&#39;s quite a bit smaller! Not only would you have to probably bore out the mouthpiece a bit to fit it on the same neck cork as other mouthpieces for a given saxophone neck, but the sound and tuning of the mouthpieces would probably be affected a little bit too, right? 
Making a mold for brass casting seems a lot more complicated, more steps involved until you end up with a mold that can handle the temps of pouring molten brass into it.
However, since there are people who probably make molds for a living, I wonder how expensive it would be to have molds made of some really nice mouthpieces for resin/brass casting. I&#39;m sure it is very costly, but it would be interesting to know how much it would be. Of course, it would be kind of scary to give them a vintage Link to make a mold for, hopefully the subjects aren&#39;t normally damaged in the process of making the molds.

something like "lost wax casting" there are some really cool and detailed
videos about the process of making molds for copying jewelry or small statues
or other things like that. However, what seems pretty complicated to me is
making a mold for a complex model like a mouthpiece, where you have to
preserve the external shape and the internal chamber that would also need to
be part of the mold. Theo's site had some info about how to deal with removing
the original model from the mold after you form it around the mouthpiece, such
as making the mold with a small dowel in the (center, I'm assuming) of the
chamber of the mouthpiece so that the rubber in the chamber will collapse on
itself allowing you to pull the mouthpiece out of the mold after the rubber is
formed around it, but it still seems pretty tricky. Plus, I guess if you were
copying a mouthpiece, it might turn out a little smaller than the original. I
don't know how much, but if it's 6-10% like it says on Theo's site, that's

mouthpiece a bit to fit it on the same neck cork as other mouthpieces for a
given saxophone neck, but the sound and tuning of the mouthpieces would
probably be affected a little bit too, right?

I read the first article of Clark Fobes saying he hand finishes 8000 mouthpieces 
a year. Wooow....
I&#39;m happy to do one every 2-3 days.
