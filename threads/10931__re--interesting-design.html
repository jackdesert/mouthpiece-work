In mileage and power studies, vortex type intake products do not help cars.
But we are talking about a different amount of air volume and speed.
Besides, if you are exhaling a 14:1 air to ethanol mix- you won&#39;t be able to
play, at least not standing up. 

I wonder if the air will mostly form a boundary layer and float over the
groves unaffected. I&#39;d try one just to hear it. After all, I like a square
chamber better than horse shoe or round shape, and I have no real
explanation of why it works.
