            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Paul,

I&#39;ve done as you and Keith told me... and I can only said well done, absolutely a good job and the Link play as before! I believed the brass there to be so thin to leave the epoxy to take strong.

The putty I found it&#39;s a metal epoxy in tube paste dual-components and was working good, the part filled looks strong enough and as a result of the tone nothing is change after I flattened the dune to the previous level.

I also remove "the coral reef" from the baffle, but impossible to clean from stain  and sign of... "zoantus and anemones"... red, green, yellow... and violet too!

Thanks to both. Gian
