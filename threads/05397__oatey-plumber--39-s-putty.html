            <pre class='message__body'>i have been collecting some of the stuff that I have seen recommended
in the files area and the post archives that I have read through (I&#39;ve
only read through 5xx of them).  Today, I was at Home Depot and picked
up some Oatey Plumber&#39;s Putty.

The question I have is this; is it supposed to stay soft?  It doesn&#39;t
appear that the stuff that I picked up set&#39;s up like epoxy.  I also
picked up some Plumbing Epoxy Putty, which does set up hard.

Is there a specific use for each type?  If I had to guess, I would
guess that one could use the non-setting stuff for temporary trials
and then recreate it in the hard-setting stuff.

Thanks for the advice.

David

Not the two sticks I have purchased and used.  You slice some off and mix
it for a minute or so until the two parts look like one gray shade of
putty.  You have about 5 minutes to shape it before it starts to set up. 
You can feel it get warm as an exothermic reaction helps to set it up.

It needs to work this way so a plumber can plug a leak with it.
