            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Guys.  Started a sort of Wikipedia for sax mouthpieces, it's called mouthpiecewiki http://mouthpiecewiki.com .  If you guys have any knowledge and/or pictures you would like to share, please stop by and contribute.  It's just starting out but between us all I think it could become a useful resource. 
 cheers
