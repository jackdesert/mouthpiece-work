            <pre class='message__body'>I attended the show from the opening to the closing, and from a saxophone
point of view, the important news was what was NOT happening: Selmer,
Keilwerth, Yamaha, Yanagasawa, Cannonball, and some other "majors" were NOT
there. I can only surmise that they had nothing new to show and either
lacked the resources or the desire to show their existing product lines.
There were LOTS of new Asian brands (mostly Selmer copies, but getting
better at fit and finish all the time) and the prices seem to be getting
lower every day.
 
We got a great reception for our new  L A Sax Steve Goodson Model and the
other new series we were showing. I hate to say it, but it&#39;s true: we were
the only manufacturer showing anything new and different. My ears are still
hurting from all of the guys trying out the altissimo key and the high G
key!
 
I got spend lots of time visiting with various industry figures, and the
news is that there are still lots of horns being sold, but the "high price"
stuff may have finally reached the point of consumer/dealer resistance.
$3000+ horns (actual selling price, not "list price") are not exactly flying
off the shelves, and when they do, the dealers margins are down to almost
nothing.
 
Without exception, all of the Yamaha dealers I spoke with were beyond angry
about the Costco deal, and believe they have had their years of loyalty
betrayed.
 
My friends and associates in Asia were all quite happy and seemingly
prosperous. There are no saxophones being manufactured in the USA now, and
except for Selmer (Paris) almost none in Europe. The Asian makers have
picked up all of the business that was formerly elsewhere.
 
I had dinner with my friend Dennis Bamber, owner of Woodwind/Brasswind, and
he reports the overall health of the industry to be quite good. Other
retailers who are flexible about changing with the times also report good
results, while those sticking to the old business models are struggling.
 
I&#39;ve got some new distribution deals for some of our Saxgourmet brand
products, and have entered into some new manufacturing deals for new
products. I&#39;ll announce the specifics as soon as the ink is dry and the
details are all worked out.
 
I&#39;m exhausted (Indianapolis is a FUN place to have a convention) and have
almost a thousand emails, so that&#39;s it for now....
