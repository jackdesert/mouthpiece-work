            <pre class='message__body'>Once I get some tools, does it matter whether I start experimenting 
with clarinet or alto, tenor, or bari sax MPCs (these are what I have 
around the house)?

At the moment, I&#39;ve been considering acquiring some Yamaha or Rico 
bari MPCs, even though they&#39;re plastic, since they&#39;re fairly 
inexpensive on eBay, and since I&#39;ve been playing a bari fairly 
regularly, more so than anything else other than always going back to 
my alto, just for fun.

Or, would I be better off to start with some rubber MPCs?

Or does any of this matter, as long as I start measuring and working 
on some of what I have around?

            <pre class='message__body'>It does not matter a lot where you start.  I think most beginners ruin 1-3
mouthpieces, so start with what you wont mind losing.

I started on a clarinet and could not get the table flat until it was way
overcut.  I then filed the sides and practiced on the facing curve.  Then I
hacked away at the chamber some.  Just getting a feel for each stage of the
work is what you need.  I was trying to make a playable piece, but I think
it would have been less stressfull if I just accepted the 1st one was
strictly for the feel of the tools and the cutting progress.

The next one was easier, but still took a lot of time.  Would you believe
like 6-8 hours?  It was a player though.

I like working on the larger MPs better.  Its easier for me to get inside
the chamber and the facing work is more spread out.
