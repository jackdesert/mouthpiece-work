            <pre class='message__body'>Since clear epoxy is a different color than glass (always a bit yellowish) and has a different refractive index and translucency any repair will be visible. As to whether it is permanently repairable, much would depend on the size, shape and position of the chip.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have refaced almost ten O&#39;Brien mp four of them with
important chip just on the tip aperture side.
Since, in the 30ties, mps were produced by artizan
methods and not like  the actual ebonite using numeric
control mill machine, hand refacing sometime will give
better result in quality of sound and intonation then
in the original.
The procedure is: first eliminate the chip, and after
close the aperture to the desired value.
The roof hight will conseguently be reduced and
sonority increased which is normally a benefit.
Since the resonant chamber, which is the real best
feature in O&#39;Brien mp, stays the same, tipical sound
colour remain also the same.
The glass used by O&#39;Brien is very tender and little
green coloured in the early production (that ones
signed O&#39;Brien on the table) of better crystal quality
in last production.

Only a glass to glass fusion in oven at least at 750
�C hoping that the glass of mp has a higher melting
point than that of soldering glass(that should be
phisically and chemically compatible) but after, you
should reface it in any case.
I have tryed also structural epoxy after ultrasonic
clening but after an unforseenable period of time you
discover that (just during an exibition) your mp is
cipped again.
