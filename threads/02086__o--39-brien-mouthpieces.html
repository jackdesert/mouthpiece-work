            <pre class='message__body'>Hello, I was wondering if anyone had some information on O&#39;Brien 
crystal clarinet mouthpieces. Like info on O&#39;Brien himself and the 
mpcs.

Also, how would one fix a chip in the beak? Isn&#39;t there an epoxy 
that can be used? How does it turn out? Like does it seem like 
nothing ever happened, or will there be a blemish?

Thanks!
Bonnie

            <pre class='message__body'>Since clear epoxy is a different color than glass (always a bit yellowish) and has a different refractive index and translucency any repair will be visible. As to whether it is permanently repairable, much would depend on the size, shape and position of the chip.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have refaced almost ten O&#39;Brien mp four of them with
important chip just on the tip aperture side.
Since, in the 30ties, mps were produced by artizan
methods and not like  the actual ebonite using numeric
control mill machine, hand refacing sometime will give
better result in quality of sound and intonation then
in the original.
The procedure is: first eliminate the chip, and after
close the aperture to the desired value.
The roof hight will conseguently be reduced and
sonority increased which is normally a benefit.
Since the resonant chamber, which is the real best
feature in O&#39;Brien mp, stays the same, tipical sound
colour remain also the same.
The glass used by O&#39;Brien is very tender and little
green coloured in the early production (that ones
signed O&#39;Brien on the table) of better crystal quality
in last production.

soda (sodium bicarb)?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve never done it myself, but I might try a castable acrylic (2-part 
mix) that you can get from Tap Plastics. I use this extremely clear 
very hard plastic for a variety of jobs around the shop.

            <pre class='message__body'>I am sorry but does not exist any glue, for glass,
that will be stable under the continuous vibration of
the reed in a wet alcaline ambient like clarinettist
mouse.
Only a glass to glass fusion in oven at least at 750
�C hoping that the glass of mp has a higher melting
point than that of soldering glass(that should be
phisically and chemically compatible) but after, you
should reface it in any case.
I have tryed also structural epoxy after ultrasonic
clening but after an unforseenable period of time you
discover that (just during an exibition) your mp is
cipped again.

            <pre class='message__body'>An artistic glass blower might be able to dab a bead of glass on it.  Then
you would probably need to have it stress relieved in an anealing oven (or
lehr).

Lab chemists also play around with burners and glass tubing.
