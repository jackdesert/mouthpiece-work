Subject: Clar. mpc refacing kit

Greetings,

I&#39;m getting ready to reface some clarinet mouthpieces. I have the gauges and
the old Eric Brand Manual.

What grade of sandpaper should I use?

What is a good surface to use?

is inexpensive.  I use 3/8" thick x 9" x 11".  I sanded the edges 
myself to save more $, but I have access to a wet belt sander.

I use silicone carbide (black) paper from 220 to 1500 grits.  Most 
work can be done in the 400-800 range.  I find the best supply of 
this paper at the local automotive parts store.

            <pre class='message__body'>Silicon Carbide paper, not ordinary sandpaper, in 400 and 600 grit will 
cover 95% of your needs.  400 is too coarse for work on the facing itself. 

 

On hard rubber and plastic, I use 400 only for flatting the most warped 
tables, moving on to 600 as I get close to a flat table.  I use 600 for 
all the facing work.

 

On metal pieces, I find 400 is better.  Then when almost done, I switch 
to 600.

 

A little trick I discovered... for a final nice polish, turn the paper 
over, yes, backside up, and do a couple of strokes on the table, and one 
or two light strokes on the facing.  There is just enough fine carbide 
dust on the paper to give a nice, shiny polish to those surfaces.  This 
is not necessary for playing, the mouthpiece will play just as well 
without this step.  But it makes your work look more finished, 
professional, to the customer. 

 

I use a piece of 3/8" thick tempered glass 6" x 9"as a work surface.  
This came with my kit from John Winslow (Madison Enterprises).

            <pre class='message__body'>Greetings and thanks for the response re: kit.

I am using silicone carbide 400, 600, and 800.

To introduce myself, I teach clarinet and music classes at Northern 
Virginia Community College and am a free-lance clarinetist in the DC 
area. I also founded the Klarinet listserv.

Its been many years since I&#39;ve done mouthpiece work and am enjoying 
getting back to it.

Any ideas on reamers for the tone chamber of clarinet mouthpieces, 
ie where to get them or fashion them?

plastic modelers and model railroaders, many of the things they have are 
well suited to our purposes.
