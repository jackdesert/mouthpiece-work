            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m presently working with a Link STM that has a rollover baffle. The question is, how do I 
make adjustments to this kind of baffle and what effects will they have? I basically want to get 
it to blow a little more freely and with maybe a pinch more edge. Thanks in advance for your 
input.

Blowing more freely has more to do with the quality of the facing work 
on the side rails.  For more edge, you may be able to open the tip some 
and make a slightly larger and longer roll-over while doing this.  Some 
have built up roll-overs using epoxy or clear nail polish.  I have not.

I have read this term "roll-over" a lot here on this forum.  Can someone please tell me what 
this is?
