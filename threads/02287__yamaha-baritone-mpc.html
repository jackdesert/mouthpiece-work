            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Yamaha baritone mpc 5C. it has been scratched with sandpaper (more than 320 grits.....) from the table to the tip. I would restore this mpc at its original conditions: what is the tip opening (2,10 mm?) and the length of the curve for B5 baritone mpc?
thanks in advance.

            <pre class='message__body'>I wouldn&#39;t waste the time trying to put a Yamaha 5C back to original 
specs.  They are horrible mouthpieces in original spec.  I&#39;ve redone 
several of them and made very good sounding pieces but they are very 
brittle plastic and chip if you even look at them hard.  I&#39;ve had the 
tips chip just from the pressure of refacing them on fine sandpaper 
and glass.  However, I&#39;ve got two that I&#39;ve reworked and are really 
great playing pieces now -- I worry about selling them though, since 
they chip so easily. 

I don&#39;t remember the exact tip opening but it was very narrow - 
maybe .075" (about 1.92mm)  I opened one up to .105" and the other 
to .118 (the .105 really needs to be opened up more I think).

I would not waste my time restoring a Yamaha mpc (I would need a day made of 48 hours
to do all the things I have to do.....), but last week I asked the owner of a music shop 
to put up a brochure about my "art of mpcs refacing" (ah!).....he gave me this damaged yamaha bari mpc
to "test my skills" before he exposes my brochure; 
I hope to do a good work with your help,
thanks, Filippo

            <pre class='message__body'>I have two new yamaha 5C bari mouthpieces that just came in.  I 
measured them and get .077" tip opening or 1.98mm which is about what 
I remembered in my previous post.  This is extremely narrow tip 
opening for a bari in my opinion.

I played in a HS pit with a fellow who was using the 5C but with a 
Bari brand plastic reed.  It really sounded great to me and I use 
high baffle .105" tips on bari.

            <pre class='message__body'>Some of it depends on chamber size in relation to tip opening in my opinion.  The Morgan 1C is even smaller than .077 at .068.  My vintage pieces can measure even more closed than the Morgan!  The old Buescher pieces were .063 for their medium facing piece (facing length was 25.4mm).  

The spec for the 5C is .082 or 2.10mm.  For classical on this piece it might be better with a tip opening a bit larger say up to .095.  It really depends on what the player wants to do with it and what kind of chops they have.
