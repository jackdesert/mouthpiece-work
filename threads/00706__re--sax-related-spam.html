Not all that odd as something like 80% of overseas generated Spam comes from
Cybercafe&#39;s in several Arab Countries.

We simple figure these folk are either have a master world domination plan
involving Bass Saxophones, or simply can&#39;t spell "Base Sex"...

They usually end up on the "Bouncing Members" list (where Yahoo Groups puts
list members who&#39;s email bounce) and we delete them later.

So far none have answered any inquiries.

Bass sax Spam from Arab countries? I know for  a fact that Spam is a no-no in their diet. They risk losing a body part for that. Actually, I&#39;ve been in a couple of cybercafes in Tunisia, North Africa. They&#39;re pretty dismal affairs where you pay a dinar to sit on a metal folding chair and have someone standing over your shoulder who can&#39;t wait to get online to chat with girls named Leila and Mme. Sophie.
Do you think maybe Hans Blix should be looking for weapons of BASS destruction...?
