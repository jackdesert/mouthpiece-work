If you are working and machining IIRC Beryllium copper you need some 
very significant controls.  EPA, NEPA, OSHA and your local health and 
safety regulations are all going to be involved anytime you make 
Beryllium dust, chips or particles.  The level of controls will involve 
negative air pressure sealed rooms, remote control tools, HEPA 
filtration systems, exhaust air cleaners, full bunny suits, shower 
facilities, inspections, operating permits, waste disposal controls and 
much more.  In other words, do not do this in your garage or workshop.  
Fines for violations are staggering.  Yes I am a certified safety 
engineer, yes I am a certified environmental engineer, yes I have been 
safety guy for a beryllium facility (Los Alamos National Laboratory).  
Do not play with IIRC Beryllium copper unless you have the backing of a 
major cooperation or the Government.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would expect pure Berryllium to attract this kind of safety.  But I would 
think once it is alloyed in small quantities with the copper it would be a lot 
safer to handle.  


What is "IIRC" Berryllium copper?  If I Recall Correctly...

If you are working and machining IIRC Beryllium copper you need some 
very significant controls. EPA, NEPA, OSHA and your local health and 
safety regulations are all going to be involved anytime you make 
Beryllium dust, chips or particles. The level of controls will involve 
negative air pressure sealed rooms, remote control tools, HEPA 
filtration systems, exhaust air cleaners, full bunny suits, shower
