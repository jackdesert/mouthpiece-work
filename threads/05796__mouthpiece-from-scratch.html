 Hello everyone,

 Yes !! I want and I´ll make a mouthpiece from a block of wood. Sounds
crazy ? Maybe, but I like the idea and I don´t know why ..
 So, I need the right information to get started .. I´m analyzing a 
Vandorem A45 V5 .. but I don´t like it at all. I want a very smoooooth 
sound, less brilhance also. Any welp with measure needed ? Any 
blueprints ? Any projects ? 

 Forgive my English lacks, have anyone started a mouthpiece from 0 ?
 Thanks for you attention guys,
 Regards,
 Sam, Brazil

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I bought a silver-plated "Otto" Chinese-made (I presume, not labeled as
such) tenor mouthpiece from Ebay seller violinking8.

These were not listed as having any particular facing or chamber. I figured,
at the price, it would be worth having to play around with, whatever it was.
As it turns out, I found that they run from sizes "5-8" but with no info on
what the actual tip opening is.

What I received was a very nicely finished silver-plated mouthpiece labeled
"A-7", with the word "Maestro" finely etched onto the top of the body,
through the silver down to the brass. The tip opening measures 0.080" (using
"Guto&#39;s Gauge", with tip on the center of the tip rail width). Tip rail
width approx .03", as best as I can tell. The side rails are narrow, quite
symmetric, except at the .002 gauge, where there is a 0.5mm difference
between sides. 

For the record, a Link 7 is a 0.100" tip opening according to the Woodwind
catalog, so this "7" has no relation to the Link numbers.

Judging from the fine machining marks on the silver plating on the facing,
I&#39;d guess that the final facing was done after the silver plating.

I&#39;ll compare it to a Ponzol M1 with a .095 tip opening, because I have one,
which plays very well, and to which the "Maestro" has some similarities.
(The "Maestro" doesn&#39;t play nearly as well well, but I hope to tweak it
favorably.)

It is chambered somewhat similarly to the Ponzol M1, with some differences.
It has a step baffle that is a tad longer than than the Ponzol, ~1.30"
(compared to ~1.15"). The step is about 0.17" high (compared to about 0.25"
on the Ponzol).

The window is 1.82" long (compared to 1.68" on the Ponzol).
The table is about .025" narrower than the Ponzol

A big difference is a largish rollover baffle that peaks about 3/8 inch from
the tip rail.  In comparison, the Ponzol has a nearly flat baffle, rolling
off slightly just near the tip.

The Link style ligature that came with the piece actually works well. Its
knurled knob is easy to grip, and one can tighten it sufficiently to prevent
sideways reed slippage.

The facing measurements are as follows:

Gauge    Maestro A7     Ponzol M1
.002      41                            44
.004      38                            40
.007      34                            36
.010      31                            34
.014      28                            28
.018      26                            26
.024      22                            22
.030      16                            16
.050      10                            11
.063        6                              7
.071        4                              4
.080        2                            ~1

I realize some of these gauges are not standard sizes; some are made of
several feeler gauges spot-welded together, and this is how they measured on
the micrometer, never mind how they should have added up.

FWIW, the facing curve on the Ponzol is a very easy-blowing one.
