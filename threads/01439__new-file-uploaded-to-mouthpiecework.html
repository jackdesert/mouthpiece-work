            <pre class='message__body'>Hello to all,

I realize that there are two other glass gauge templates posted in the "Tools" section.  But since I don&#39;t have Corel, and the paint version doesn&#39;t print well for me, I decided to create another one that I hope some of you may find value in.  I created the file using an open source drawing program called Inkscape.  The file format is supposedly standards based so you could edit it in other applications as well.  But if you download Inkscape (it&#39;s free btw) you should be able to print it easily enough.  Anyway...enjoy!
