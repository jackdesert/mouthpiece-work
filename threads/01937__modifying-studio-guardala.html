            <pre class='message__body'>I work only on my own mpcs.  Presently I am looking at modifying a 
tenor studio guardala (lazer trim) and one of the first things I 
think I want to do is to reduce the tip opening.  The overall design 
of the tenor guardala seems very specific and inherent, but the tip 
opening is too large for my tastes. Do any of you have experience 
you would share re: closing down the tip of a guardala. Can the tip 
opening be closed without destorying the generally fine playing 
qualities of the mpc.  How much can one close down the tip and how 
would that change the overall scheduling of the lay? Thanks in 
advance. mike

            <pre class='message__body'>This is quite unusual, but I have 2 Laser Cut Studios in my "shop" 
now.  On measure .111" with a 50L the other .1095" with a 50.75L.  
The facings are even and deviate only slightly from a smooth curve.

The undercut ramp at the base of the window is fairly sharp.  When 
closing it down by cutting the table, the window will get probably 
longer.  If you only close it to .105", it might stay the same.  How 
much do you want to close it?

One of my clients wants the chamber enlarged to make the piece more 
like a MB model.  This will be interesting since I have another one 
that will not be modified.

Closing the tip to .105" would be ideal for my tastes. I would like 
to keep the lay schedule, i.e., "smooth curve", relatively the 
same.  I guess one has to do the math. I agree that because of the 
design of the undercut ramp closing the tip would lengthen the 
window some. In that regard I wonder if it would also make the 
baffle relatively higher but shorter? FYI -- My regular mpc is an 
older link stm 6* original facing w/a high baffle but I also have a 
studio guardala lazer trim which I will not modify.

Dont rework the baffle.  This not so large a change that you need to 
mess with it.  You can leave the tip area untouched as you cut the 
table.  Just keep a check that your table is flat and measure the tip 
as you cut the table.  When you get to .105", you should have a 
shorter facing length (too short).  Get a target curve for .105" and 
a facing length of 48-49.

If you want some help with the targets, post your feeler set 
demensions.
