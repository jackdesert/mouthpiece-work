 Thanks!

It&#39;s really a more interesting question than I thought...

I haven&#39;t liked the Rico or Yamahas in this range much.

If it had to be a new not used, and still manufactured,
I think I might end up with a Brilhart.  Not my favorite,
but I&#39;ve had better luck with them than Yamaha or Rico.

For the best students, the Runyon Custom with Spoiler was an easy sell - jazz and concert mouthpiece for the same price. Goodson mouthpieces are on my wish list of premium, hand faced models. But unless there is an entry level model I am unaware of, they are too much for this discussion. New SElmer hard rubber or metal models are out due to price too.</pre>

Many families in my area are in the same situation....however, a
second-hand (perhaps even re-faced) Selmer C* (or similar) can be had for
under $50 &#39;chez moi&#39;, which is quite popular.

If you have to mic a saxophone, the rest of the band is TOO LOUD!

            <pre class='message__body'>Runyon made the Morgan Protones. The Protone was the same as the Runyon Model 22, but with a different shank piece used in the mold.  I think the Hite may have been the same.  I know I saw some Hite products being produced at Runyon.  I don't know if it was just the molding, or they were completely finished there. I got the impression Hite did some fine finish work.

Bass clarinet mouthpieces for a number of manufacturers were produced there at Runyon, differing only in the logo stamped.

I, too, am looking for mouthpieces to sell.
