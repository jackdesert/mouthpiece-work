            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

I&#39;m in the market for a flex shaft system to be used on mouthpieces for such things as expanding chambers, undercutting tables/windows, and working on sidewalls. I&#39;m trying to piece the system together on a budget, and there is actually a nice looking kit that looks like it would fit the job except for the fact that the handpiece is a #30-style handpiece which would make it too large to fit into the bore of a mouthpiece. I know that a lot of chamber work can be done from the front of the chamber, but I&#39;ve seen multiple refacers working on the chamber from the back of the bore. To do this, you need a handpiece that it slim enough to be useable from that side of the mouthpiece. This is the kit I&#39;m talking about: 
http://www.ottofrei.com/store/product.php?productid294&cat=0&page=1

However, the universal flex shaft sold by the Micromark company would be perfect for this kind of application. I just don&#39;t know if it would fit onto the Grobet motor from the above-linked kit. http://www.micromark.com/UNIVERSAL-FLEX-SHAFT,6558.html

Any suggestions? Buying the foot speed-control, a decent dremel-type rotary tool, and the above-mentioned universal flex shaft would be just as expensive, if not more, than getting the Grobet kit and only being able to work on the chamber from the front of the mouthpiece because of the width/diameter of the #30 handpiece (1"). You may be able to piece together a really cheap off-brand kit made up of separate components, but I figure it&#39;s best to try and get decent equipment rather than buying really really cheap stuff that may not last, etc. 

Thanks,

Matt

jewelry engraving industry.  They are air driven and cost in the

economical to buy the cheaper tool and look for longer shafted bits.  
They aren&#39;t too hard to find.  I pulled up dozens of listings with 
little effort.

The thought of a longer shanked burr crossed my mind too - but I cannot find any longer shanked burrs online that have a shank diameter of less than 1/4" which is too big for the handpieces on small flexible shaft units. Would you mind posting a link to a source where you located these longer-shanked burrs? I&#39;d spring for them for sure, but the collets on the handpieces that come with flex shaft units only go up to 5/32". Thanks,
