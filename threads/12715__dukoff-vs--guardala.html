            <pre class='message__body'>Hello Steve, I don't know why but the image is not shown in the web version. Maybe caused by the ":" sign in the name. I attached a renamed version.
 Interesting for a lot of reasons. Hope that helps.
 The way of measuring and drawing a mouthpiece is interesting. I think there are more items to measure but the set shows the most important ones. Is the drawing and the set base on a method? Is it the Sax Gourmet method or is it more common?
 Btw: I have a parametric mouthpiece design now with over 50 parameters. But some of the are only cosmetic.

            <pre class='message__body'>it’s not on these drawings (I didn’t make them) but you could easily measure it
