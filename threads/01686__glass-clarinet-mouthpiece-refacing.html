            <pre class='message__body'>Someone contacted me looking for a refacer for glass clarinet 
mouthpieces.  I might try it, but I said I would ask if anyone

            <pre class='message__body'>You should be able to work with carbide papers, and diamond files and diamond chip Dremel bits are hard enough to work the material, albeit a bit rough. I&#39;ve used them to shape glass, but I&#39;ve never worked on a glass mpc. Perhaps if you can find an old junk glass mpc somewhere you can use it to get an feel without putting a valuable one at risk.

I can get diamond files and dremel-size bits over here for $1 apiece (god bless the Chinese). If you are interested e-mail me and we can discuss what sizes/types are available and how I might get some to you.

Good luck,

Toby
