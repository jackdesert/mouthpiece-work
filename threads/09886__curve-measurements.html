Could any generous person give me a good plot of meaurements in order to obtain an orchestral clarinet mouthpiece?
Specifically I am looking for something which allows lots of air to come in without breaking the sound between G5 and C6. Something powerful, and with big volume in the high register.
Thank you,
Fran

Yes, I left the zero out of the measurements. I have each thickness gauge
numbered with a black felt tip pen to easily see them with these old eyes.
Don't need the zero!

And yes, the PDF makes my facing look wiggly and I will have to research why.
Glancing a light source down the facing does not reveal anything but a
beautiful, gentle curve to just behind the tip, which is flat. And the
mouthpiece plays beautifully on virgin Vandoren reeds.

And yes, I use many more gauges. I discovered a while ago that the 0.037
showed many differences on mouthpieces that were right on for the 0.047 and
the 0.035. I then spaced the others sort of equally between the originals. The
0.018 also can often spot a discrepancy. The reason may be my technic of
pulling the blank along the sandpaper.

KenL Curve Analysis.pdf 

Your measurements suggest a facing length of 13.25mm which would be quite short, assuming your readings are given in half millimeters.  The curve is approximated by a straightness factor of 0.7 by my reckoning.  This is a somewhat flattish curve which be may helping to offset the relatively short facing.

Like Keith said, the wriggly-ness of your curve is probably not as bad in reality and could be due to your gauges not being exactly the marked sizes.

Andrew
