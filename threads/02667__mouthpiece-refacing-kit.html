Hello,

I am working on putting together a kit for sale in the future.  I 
only work on clarinet mouthpieces, so my kit, as it is, only 
includes what I use to work on mouthpieces.  If anyone has any 
suggestions, I´ll be glad to consider them to add to the kit, as 
adding things now is easy in the prototype stage.  Currently, I have 
a very good thick refacing surface glass, a good glass gauge, and 
good thickness feeler gauges (but only .0015, .010, .024, .034).  
The tip wand is the pain right now.  I´ve made several prototypes 
that are not exact enough yet to put into production.  As soon as I 
make a few that are consistent, the kit will be available.  My hope 
is to keep the cost down so that the ¨average¨ guy can afford a 
kit.  I´ll let you know as soon as they are ready.

Ben

            <pre class='message__body'>Ben,
 
Will your kit include instructions for novices?  I want to learn to  reface 
clarinet mouthpieces, but have had no experience in that area and know of  no 
one in my area that does refacing that I could get help from.  Does the  Eric 
Brand book still exist in any form?

            <pre class='message__body'>The Erick Brand book is most likely still available from Ferree&#39;s.  Note
that most of the book deals with instrument repair. There is just a small
chapter or two on refacing.

A good accurate tip guage would be such a plus. Calipers and holding 
a depth guage on a piece of glass is such a pain. Perhaps a 
scientific instrument company would make a bunch up for you (and us) 
a not a killer cost. Even a depth guage mounted on a piece of glass 
zeroed out at the bottom of the glass would be GREAT! Thanks Ben!
