            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

Thanks for the reply........

In talking to Paul C. he recommends the Winslow over the Babbitt gauge...wonder why?

I do have the list you are talking about.  What is a wand tip gauge, and how does it work?  Are there measurements to be found somewhere with the proper tolerances for mpcs?

And what do you know about "curve gauges"?  That is, is there a way to check the curve of the tip?  Or have I been smokin&#39; something?

All this is very new to me, and at the same time exciting.  I am beginning to see many similarities between the set-up between the double reed and the single reed.  I can&#39;t wait to start experimenting with some mpcs I have to see if I am able to turn them into something I can use.

Thanks again for your time,

Fred

  Welcome!  Look on the MouthpieceWorks site in the Files area.  There are
  lists of suggested equipment and sources where you can get it.  The glass
  gage you asked about is easy to get from Babbitt for about $15.  I think
  Babbitt may have wand tip gages too.  I like to use digital calipers to
  measure tips.  Plus, they can be used to measure other parts of the
  mouthpiece and can be used to verify what your feeler gage thicknesses
  really are.  MicroMark has some econimical calipers.

  Look through the early posts in the archive.  We talked a lot about
  equipment when the group was first started.  Later, one of our members
  compiled all the info into the lists in the Files section.

The Winslow kit has a lot of good stuff in it.  I dont know anything 
special about the glass gage.

> 
> I do have the list you are talking about.  What is a wand tip 
gauge, and how does it work?  

Its a gradually tapered metal stick that has a slight curve to it.  
You hold the MP table on a flat surface (like the back of the glass 
gage) and you insert the wand to see how far it fits in.  There are 
graduations to tell you what the gap (tip opening) is.

>> Are there measurements to be found somewhere with the proper 
tolerances for mpcs?

Generally no.  There are a few scattered examples in the archives.  
Refacers usually measure everthing they can get a hold of and make up 
their own notebook.  If you adopt a standard set of feelers you can 
use reading others may share.  If you have a different set, you may 
still be able to use their info, but you will need to convert it for 
use with your feelers.  There is an Excel spreadsheet in the Files 
area that can give you an idea how to do this (if you are used to 
working with spreadsheets).

> 
> And what do you know about "curve gauges"?  That is, is there a way 
to check the curve of the tip? 

If you mean how well it conforms to the curve of a reed end, you just 
use your favorite reed and your eye.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Paul.

Here&#39;s one for you.  I called the telephone # that is listed on the manual for Winslow.  I got a man who didn&#39;t want to talk, but took my name and phone # and never called back (Winslow?).......more.  I got the new W/W & Brass catalog today and there the Winslow kit is....for $195.  phew!  Do you know anyone who has the mic and the glass gauge for sale?  Thatsa&#39; lot of gelt!  I have everything else.

Thanks again,

Fred

    You may be referring to the glass gauge and feelers, which are used to plot the curve of the facing.
