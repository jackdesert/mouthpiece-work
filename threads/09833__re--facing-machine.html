            <pre class='message__body'>Silverio,

you&#39;re absolutely right - adjusting method is necessary. I forgot to mention that my machine already has one. It&#39;s done the most simple way there is: the sandpaper is glued to a piece of cheap board which is then screwed to the support. The distance adjustment is done by setting pieces of thin veneer in between. Very simple and cheap, but works. This way is easy and cheap to chance the paper too.

Your way is of course more advanced, but since I didn&#39;t know if this thing works at all, I didn&#39;t yet invest any money to it. All the parts are scrap material.

The new better explained picture is at the photos section.
