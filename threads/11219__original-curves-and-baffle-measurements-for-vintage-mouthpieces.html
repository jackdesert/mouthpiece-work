            <pre class='message__body'>I would be very interested in original tenor sax curve and baffle measurements for original Otto Link Reso Chamber and original Selmer Short Shank Soloist mouthpieces.

I recently bought a Selmer Soloist C** for tenor and would like to have it opened up to an F, G, H or I, and refaced to an original curve.

Any information or suggestions would be much appreciated.

I can probably come up with a spreadsheet of facings that I think would be typical for Selmers.  Their facings tend to be short and elliptical with an aspect ratio of 8 or so.  These facings have a really poor low end IMO.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,
Thanks for the info!

Theo Wanne said something similar on his mouthpiece museum page, but specifically about Soloists with larger tip openings (F, G & H). It would be interesting to see how a pool of data reflects this concept.

On the other hand, I&#39;m playing in a big band with Rich Perry this week. We were talking about his Soloist and he has been playing an original F facing Soloist forever. So apparently he was able to make it work for him. :)

I&#39;d be curious to start by copying an F facing to fulfill my curiosity of how it feels, and if it really doesn&#39;t work for me, then I could lengthen the lay/change to a smaller ratio curve. So far my favorite tenor pieces have been in the +2 to +3 range.

Any info you could share from your database would be much appreciated!

In the meantime, I&#39;m (not so patiently) waiting for those new feeler gages. :)

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>thanks for your reply , 
 i have copied a curve from well playing Otto Link 
 on my 1st refacing attempt of a Selmer S80 C** :
 i've menaged to flatten the table ( was the hardest part) , 
 to shape the tip & the tip rail, 
 trimmed out side rails, 
 enlarged the square chamber to a round one with scooped out side walls, 
 menaged to put on a facing curve like this:
 Tip Opening : 0.105"
 0.015 - 52
 0.002 - 50
 0.005 - 44
 0.010 - 38
 0.012 - 36
 0.020 -  31+
 0.024 - 28
 0.029 - 26
 0.034 - 24
 0.039 - 22-
 0.044 - 20
 0.050 - 18
 0.062 - 14
 0.082 - 8
 0.96 - 4 -
 

 i haven't used the spreadsheet method ( find it difficult still) just 
 kept righting the measurements along the way .
  It actually turned out quite well  - mouthpiece plays really nice . 
 i might have overshot some target sizes a little ... 
 the target curve length  was 50 , but i made it 52 ?
 

 would like to know what you think of this curve .. 
 should i just leave it like it is or should still improve something
 in this curve?

            <pre class='message__body'>yeah, lapping a table flat is the hardest part at first.  If the thing plays good, the numbers are good.  Leave it alone, you're done.  Unless you want it to play differently, but that's a matter of taste.  Only advice I've got is play it and if you want it to be different change it.  There's a lot of experimenting with different curves etc. before you know what to change to get what you want.

 thanks for your reply , 
 i have copied a curve from well playing Otto Link 
 on my 1st refacing attempt of a Selmer S80 C** :
 i've menaged to flatten the table ( was the hardest part) , 
 to shape the tip & the tip rail, 
 trimmed out side rails, 
 enlarged the square chamber to a round one with scooped out side walls, 
 menaged to put on a facing curve like this:
 Tip Opening : 0.105"
 0.015 - 52
 0.002 - 50
 0.005 - 44
 0.010 - 38
 0.012 - 36
 0.020 -  31+
 0.024 - 28
 0.029 - 26
 0.034 - 24
 0.039 - 22-
 0.044 - 20
 0.050 - 18
 0.062 - 14
 0.082 - 8
 0.96 - 4 -
 

 i haven't used the spreadsheet method ( find it difficult still) just 
 kept righting the measurements along the way .
  It actually turned out quite well  - mouthpiece plays really nice . 
 i might have overshot some target sizes a little ... 
 the target curve length  was 50 , but i made it 52 ?
 

 would like to know what you think of this curve .. 
 should i just leave it like it is or should still improve something
 in this curve?

 Hi, its an old thread but i too would uppreciate if someone shares a good responcive medium long curve for a Selmer soloist in a 0.95-0.105 opening range ? I am trying to reface a C* Selmer S80. Or should i just copy a facing from another good playing peace like Otto Link for example?

 my apologies , 
  i forgot to mention that my original  question about the facing curve and 
 all my other replies were about tenor mouthpiece.
