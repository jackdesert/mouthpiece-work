            <pre class='message__body'>   hi, i&#39;m new to this site and to mouthpiece work.
i&#39;m using the morgan kit for measuring and have been measuring as many
mouthpieces as i can get my hands on, specifically vintage links 
good copies like the b & n&#39;s of ackerman and some by theo and van wie. 
i was wondering if anyone has the original numbers of the facing
curves of: 4o&#39;s,50&#39;s and 60&#39;s links the guys at the link factory were 
working off of .

thanks,

tom
