            <pre class='message__body'>Hey guys, here in Argentina we also have this problem or situation. The 
important thing is to go pretending space. If you are not there to go about 
creating it. If you do not know how, encouraged to speak with the owners of pubs 
and places of recreation. Can be arranged schedules, prices, go to a percentage 
of the entry or consumisión. This forces us to have controls and a fantastic 
person or group in accordance with the groups that are responsible for 
representing them. Of course, when money starts to look through the thing 
changes. I think the main issue for musicians to start and try to get a place 
and to know what theirs is encouraged. If you really count as good musicians and 
all will come with time, the owners of such sites will surely get them. People 
are not stupid and if you have the opportunity to hear the very best, always opt 
for this, even an amateur.
Fraternal greetings
Silverio
