 Hope it&#39;s help. Ciao

            <pre class='message__body'>In the 30&#39;s, Johnny was a "Conn"man, playing a Naked Lady with underslung 
Octave mechanism.  I have video of him from 1936 doing "Dont Get around much 
anymore" playing this horn.  Prior to the Naked Lady {6m} he played a transitional 
Silver plated Conn, seriel number 243923.  I actually owned this horn for  
few years.  In 1951, Buescher signed him to an endorsement deal. He played 
Buescher horns until the late 60&#39;s when he switched to a custom built Vito from 
Leblanc.  He played this horn up until his death.

Mouthpiece wise, I know he played a Brilhart Tonalin for a long time.  I have 
a picture of him from the "Vito" years, and he is playing a black mouthpiece, 
possibly a Meyer.
