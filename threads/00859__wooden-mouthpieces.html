            <pre class='message__body'>Zinner, Labayle, Lamberson, Sugal and Freddie Gregory all currently 
list that they make/sell wood sax mouthpieces.  There may be others.

Grenadilla, Ebony and "hardwood" are mentioned.

You can find their sites in the Mouthpiece Works Links section.

            <pre class='message__body'>           Ebony ( as in professional clarinets) is the most popular wood used.     POMARICO in Italy makes them at 
           affordable  prices.
           Other woods also available from   ZINNER   in Germany , some photos on their website.
 
            I made several using Ebony. Next one will be AFRICAN BLACKWOOD  which they also use on clarinets.
            The area where 2 types of trees grows overlaps slightly, very hot somewhat dry conditions.
            According to the suplier of woods the African Blackwood is even harder than Ebony.  The hardness is good
            but might make it more prone to damage when dropped on a hard surface.
            
            The wooden pieces seems to be more responsive than metal and some rubber MPC , at least to me.
            Sound is good but depends mostly on the chamber baffle combination. Can be just as bright as metal if it has a
            high baffle. 
        
            Feels good in the mouth even without a patch. Warms up very quikly.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think there are a very few, of Ebony, aka Grenadilla.  But wood is not
a very stable material for mouthpieces.  Mouthpieces were made from
wood, many years ago.  I have seen old clarinet and a tarogato
mouthpiece made of ebony.  I have also seen the LA Sax (Orsi) contrabass
sax, with its grenadilla mouthpiece.

The main problem, for sax, is that the neck inserts into the mouthpiece,
and it would tend to crack the wood.  This happens even with plastic or
hard rubber, and to fix it we put a metal band on the shank.  Wood never
really caught on with saxophone.

Also, the facing of wood mouthpieces changes constantly due to moisture
content of the wood, temperature, all the things that affect wood.

Many, many years ago, before hard rubber, clarinetists were taught
refacing in the conservatories.  You know how the orchestra waits
patiently, while the concertmaster changes a violin string.  Well, they
waited also while the clarinetist fixed a warped facing in the middle of
the concert.

I have refaced a few old wood clarinet mouthpieces, and that material,
no matter what wood, just does not have the capability of taking the
very fine adjustment necessary for a precise, good playing facing.  Wood
is just too soft, too easily cracked.  It may play well now, but I could
not make a guarantee for tomorrow, or next week, or even 15 minutes from
now when the moisture of your breath has soaked into it.

So, wood has been tried and discarded in the past, and guys try it every
so often.  Same with glass, aka �crystal� mouthpieces� just too delicate
for any playing, not just sax.

Interestingly, while clarinetists have not adopted the metal mouthpiece,
there is a metal barrel available.  And a few clarinetists play glass
mouthpieces.  I had tried them, years ago, and after breaking the third
one from a very light tap against the music stand, gave up on glass for
that instrument.

Interestingly, there is a guy in Europe making a wood sax neck, but I
have not seen one, only heard about it.

I think they can be very nice if they are made properly, and well 
taken care of.Wood is a living material and responds on the humidity 
in our breath, which will make the wood swell. This will happen even 
though the mouthpiece are made of a very oily wood. It is therefore 
very important to dry the mouthpiece with a piece of cloth or 
something after playing, also because our saliva contains some 
protein that over time can destroy the glue in the wood that holds 
the wooden cells together. It is also very important to give the 
mothpiece some oil regularely, especially inside the mouthpiece. Bore 
oil for clarinets works fine. Cause every time you dry your mothpiece 
inside, you also take with you a bit of the  mouthpieces oil  with 
you on the  cloth that you use. Another importent thing here is not 
to leave the mouthpiece on the  sax neck after playing. That is the 
safest way to let your mouthpiece crack. When the wood starts to dry, 
it will shrink.Another importent thing is not to let the mouthpiece 
be exposed for heat, or great changes in temperature.
 The structure of the wood has a lot to say on how easy the 
mouthpiece cracks, and also how long the wood has been allowed to 
rest and dry before made into a mouthpiece counts. When cut, the wood 
has a lot of tension in it, so it is important that the wood is 
treated rigth before turned into a mouthpiece.
           When all that said, I know some sax players that plays on 
wooden mouthpieces, and never wants to play on  anything else because 
of the mellow, rich and full sound that they feel the mouthpiece give 
them, both professionals and amateur players. They just have to take 
more care of their mouthpiece.

Wood has a unique tone quality.  Most of the commercially available 
pieces are made from ebony or granadilla which both are quite dense 
and the most stable but still not as "fixed" as rubber or metal.  

The vulcanization process for rubber wasn&#39;t perfected until the early 
1830&#39;s so clarinet mouthpieces were intially wood material.  Hard 
rubber and metal proved to be more stable materials which is why wood 
is not a standard manufacturer&#39;s choice for material.

Any wooden mouthpieces that I have used for a length of time 
regardless of attention to care and hygiene have required the table 
leveled periodically. This was due to both the compression of the 
ligature and the corrosive affect of saliva on the mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, you can soak the mouthpiece in oil. But first you have to clean it
carefully with spirit to get  rid of old oil and other stuff that can be of
the surface. Then you may put your mouthpiece in a room that is not to dry
and not to different in temperature from the room  you found it in, and let
it stay there for a week or two to stabilize. Then you start carefully by
oiling the mouthpiece with a small amount of oil all over. Do it in the
evening, If the mouthpiece seems dry next morning, repeat the treatment.
After having done this , say 3 to 4 times, then you can soak it oil for a
week or so. But afterwards I think it will be ready for a good reface. If
you take care of your mouthpiece as I wrote before in my first post I think
the mouthpiece can last for a long time.

            <pre class='message__body'>Unfortunately, every few years some mouthpiece maker rediscovers wooden mouthpieces.
   
  Before the advent of hard rubber for mouthpieces, they were made of wood.  
   
  You&#39;ve probably seen a 1st Violinist break a string, and the whole orchestra and audience sit quietly while he changes the string.  I&#39;ve seen Iztak Pearman do that, and he tells jokes while he changes the string.
   
  Since wood is so dimensionally unstable, it would also happen that the whole orchestra and audience sat quietly while the clarinetist refaced his mouthpiece so that he could play his solo.

            <pre class='message__body'>I need more details to really make a fair comment.  

Before 1900, wooden saxophone mouthpieces were common.  The 
grenadilla wood actually produced a good sound, which was at least 
partially due to the skill of the mouthpiece makers.

But there were disadvantages.  Wooden mouthpieces, even the best 
ones, would change dimensions after they had been played for a 
while.  Hard rubber began to replace the wooden mouthpieces because 
hard rubber was more stable.  A saxophone player could trust a hard 
rubber mouthpiece to play the same way for decades.

I have experimented extensively with old wooden mouthpieces, trying 
to duplicate an authentic 1800s saxophone sound.  Usually I have had 
to reface the old wooden mouthpieces I found, because the wood dried 
out and shrank or warped.  Once the old mouthpieces had a good 
facing, they played very well.  Not loud, but with a rich , 
interesting sound.

Newer wood mouthpieces are a puzzle to me.  There is probably a 
slight nuance to the sound, but most of them are small chamber 
mouthpieces which overwhelm the effect of the wood on the sound of 
the mouthpiece with the power of the smaller chamber.  Hard rubber, 
plastic, metal - Anything would be better than wood under these 
circumstances, if for no other reason than stability.

If your baritone was old, it probably had one of the wonderful old 
wooden mouthpieces.  I encourage you to keep it as it is.  These 
mouthpieces are historical items that can trace the evolution of our 
modern saxophone.  Early 20th century hard rubber mouthpieces play 
very much the same, if you want to duplicate the sound.

Unfortunately, I have recently replaced a baritone sax solo using a 
19th century wooden mouthpiece on my myspace site.  Check back often -
I will post it again on this page:
