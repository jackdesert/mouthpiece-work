            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, at alls!
Sorry, i d&#39;nt speak english language, 
only good spanish.
here adjunt a picture a mouthpiece 
curved lateral graphic view error.
I scanned a plastic mouthpiece in 
process of retouching.
But the scanned image not are identical 
of real image.
The tip not coincide with the real 
aperture.
This diagram was accomplished with 
Corel Draw X3 drawing
program.
I will thank you that someone will be 
able comment me on
how to do by to accomplish this control 
and graph for generate it
with Microsoft Excel program ?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m not sure that I understand your question.

Many of us here take measurements of the facing curve using a 
graduated glass gage with feeler gages.  There are pictures of this 
method on the Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site.

This system provides XY coordinates of points along the facing curve 
which can then be plotted in a spreadsheet like MS Excel.  There are 
several sample spreadsheets in the Files area of the Yahoo Mouthpiece 
Work site.

            <pre class='message__body'>HELLO KEITH, ohhh Thank you for your response. 
Yes! you understood me; but too that i would like tell you than my 
search is oriented on scanner work of that tridimensional element. 

The "orthogonal position" (thank of terminus contribute by Luis Pablo 
Gasparotto of Argentine) with respect to glass of scanner is release 
and solutionated. 

The question is how i can to compensate the error of the view on the 
Corel Draw Program in relation of the real image of the mouthpiece 
and your measurement by graduated glass gage and others elements of 
measurement. 
Do you understand me? Are irrelevant my intention?

I am treating demonstrate that graphics differences of the finishings 
touchs or streamlines or lateral lines of right and left mouthpieces 
rails.
The possibility of to see clearly both flanks, will can to complement 
correctly, the Excel Graph.

In concret. Obtain a view of real image mouthpiece correctly, by 
scanner or other system, without replace the corrects Excel datas, 
can obtain middle range between both system of measurement. One on 
the real mouthpiece image, other on the calibrating of meditions 
setting or writed on Excel program.
Maybe than this items are solutionated now, but i d&#39;nt know.

Newlly Thank you.

Silverio
