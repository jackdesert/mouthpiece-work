            <pre class='message__body'>I did a 5 pieces this week.  A record for me (hey I have a day job).

One of the most difficult tasks I find is getting the lay length with 
the .0015" feeler, and then not messing it up along the way.  When I 
do mess it up, I have to cut the table down further to get it back.  
Too much table cutting can lead to a high spot on the table unless 
you really pay attention to holding the piece flat.

Weel with the 2 piece I did today, I just stayed away from the .0015" 
area until I got the rest of the facing correct.  This way I could 
sneak up on it without overshooting it.

Anyone else recall a difficult refacing task that they solved or need 
a solution to?
