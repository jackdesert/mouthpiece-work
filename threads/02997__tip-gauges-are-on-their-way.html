That&#39;s great to hear, Steve. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how long it 
takes to get up to Toronto. CCRA sometimes delays stuff for weeks.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,
FYI, I see where some of the guys have gotten their tip guages several days ago, but I have not received mine yet. I didn&#39;t know if this is OK from a shipping/handling standpoint, or if they should have made it here already.

Thanks,
Joe Lopez

Hey Steve,

I haven&#39;t got mine yet. It&#39;s probably cross border mail/Canada 
Customs, but I did move at the end of Feb. If you sent it some other 
method than USPS, please contact me - merlin@...

Thanks,
Merlin

            <pre class='message__body'>Canadian Customs will hold stuff up for 2 to 3 weeks, or that has been 
my experience in shipping to Canada.
