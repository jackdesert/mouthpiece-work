All of these pieces were 107 thou tip at the very end of the tip. According to Dave, this was the optimum tip for metal mouthpieces. I still have his brochere stating this fact.
I am now seeing "original Studios and MB1&#39;s" on e bay with 115 tips. Does anyone know if the tips were opened maybe at a later date due to demand.

I bought a Studio piece when they first came out and then 2 Brecker 1&#39;s
also. All from Dave when he was in Hicksville. All of these pieces were 107
thou tip at the very end of the tip. According to Dave, this was the optimum
tip for metal mouthpieces. I still have his brochere stating this fact.
I am now seeing "original Studios and MB1&#39;s" on e bay with 115 tips. Does
anyone know if the tips were opened maybe at a later date due to demand.
