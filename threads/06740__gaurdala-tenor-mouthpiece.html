            <pre class='message__body'>I bought a Studio piece when they first came out and then 2 Brecker  1&#39;s also. All from Dave when he was in Hicksville.  All of these pieces were 107 thou tip at the very end of the tip. According to Dave, this was the optimum tip for metal mouthpieces. I still have his brochere stating this fact.
I am now seeing "original Studios and MB1&#39;s" on e bay with 115 tips. Does anyone know if the tips were opened maybe at a later date due to demand.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dave also told me that he thought .107 was best.....I think all my
"original" Guardala&#39;s measure .107 right on the money......I don&#39;t believe
much of what I read on eBay, and neither should you.......
