Hi Keith
I bought a Jumbo Java 90 to compare against my old one (with your
facing suggestion.)
Even with my errors, the old one is hands down better...So I lapped 
the new one, and plugged the numbers into your spreadsheet...
I can get it to display the harsh break, but am unable to get it to 
suggest a new target...
In the hope that I&#39;ve not already worn out my welcome, I&#39;ve included 
the new facing numbers...
0015.......14.5mm
10.........12  mm
24.........8.5mm
35.........7.6mm
48.........5  mm
63.........2.6mm
Tip 85 @ 1.5mm
If you have some time I&#39;d appreciate your advice again.
Ross

I just added a new file in the Tenor Sax area titled "...message 
3077".  It has a plot of your readings and the targets below for a 
curve of best fit:

14.9
11.6
8.6
6.8
5.1
3.4

Your readings look a little too zig-zaggy when plotted.  Unless its 
been worked on, Vandorens should look a lot better than this.

I did that too fast.  You should not use those target numbers.  I 
just realized that you already lapped the table so the .0015" reading 
is way short now.

What you need is a curve that goes through a more normal facing 
length, like 46 = 23mm, and also passes through your tip opening 
of .085", if that is what you want.  You gave a tip rail width of 
1.5mm.  That is a on the fat side.  0.75 to 1 mm is better.  I&#39;ll 
use .085" at 1mm.

See the second tab of that same spreadsheet ("Good") for these 
targets based on your feeler set:

23.0
17.6
12.9
10.1
7.3
4.5

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks you so much Keith...
I will have my spreadsheet skills up to speed soon, but in the meantime, I&#39;ll be able to advance my passion to the next level.
Thanks again.
Ross
