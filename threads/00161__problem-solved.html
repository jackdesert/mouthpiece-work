            <pre class='message__body'>Well Friends, apparently I am in a lot of people&#39;s address book due to
my exposure on Sax On The Web... see what Mike says about it here:

"Paul- It&#39;s almost certainly a case of the "Klez" virus. One of its
"features" is that it takes the address of one person in an infected
machine&#39;s Outlook address book, and sends a message to another person in
the
same address book, looking like it came from the first address. So, all
you
have to do is be in someone else&#39;s address book to look like it came
from
you. The virus is not on your machine, and probably never was, it&#39;s on
someone else&#39;s, and you&#39;ll probably never track down whose.

It&#39;s a particularly nasty bugger, I have to deal with it all the time in
my
day gig as a public school tech director.

Good luck!"

So, that is a another good reason why I don&#39;t even have Outlook on my
machine here.  So, good luck, friends, and keep YOUR virus scanner
updated, too!

And for you guys with cable modems, where you leave your machine online,
I can highly advise a good firewall program you can obtain FREE...
Zonealarm, from www.zonealarm.com.  You will have to look around a
little, there is a Pro version you must pay for (for commercial use),
and a free version.  It works!  Just one more layer of protection.
