            <pre class='message__body'>Regarding sizing the shanks of mouthpieces to either 1) enlarge 
slightly or 2) resize after repairing shank damage. 

I have previously just used sandpaper and my finger (somewhat 
painfully and slowly). I have a distant past life as an automotive 
machinist. We used cylindrical hones, both rigid and flexible for 
very similar jobs. Flexible hones are available in relevant sizes to 
mouthpiece finishing and fine grits...e.g.

Anyone have any experience with an approach like this??
