Hi,
I have an old ebonite mouthpiece which part of it is discolored. How 
can I bring the color so that the mouthpiece does not have two colors.

Thanks.

Well, question is what colors are they.  If its brown and then black 
from refacing I dont think you can get rid of the brown by any method 
other than a light running over with steel wool and polishing if you 
want high gloss. (wait for other replies before you start cutting on my 
word). 

However, if part of it has that muddy greenish cast you can bring it 
back close to black by rubbing it with olive oil and then whiping it 
dry.  It stays and works well and isnt greasy.  However, once washed in 
soap it will be required again...its not a complete fix but works for 
your own pieces.  I think I got this hint from Paul Coats over at SOTW.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have used a couple of things successfully for some time. If the discoloration is not too bad, you can use a product from Meguiar&#39;s called Mirror Glaze no. 10. It&#39;s a non-abrasive polish made for glass and high-impact clear plastics. It works very well. If the discoloration/oxidation is pretty bad, I&#39;ve used a little liquid Flitz to remove it and then used the Meguiar&#39;s to finish cleaning and polishing the hard rubber. Use the Flitz sparingly, and you&#39;ll find it works great without damaging the piece. I&#39;ve used both on my old Kaspars and recently cleaned up an old Gregory tenor mouthpiece - looks like new! You&#39;ll be surprised how &#39;like-new&#39; you can get an old mouthpiece using these two, and won&#39;t have to worry over scratching or removing material from a vintage piece.

Thanks Don, 

I live in London and have to look for something similar to your 
products or if you could tell me which shops in America sell them, 
then I can ask a friend to get them for me.

It is brown and black is near the tip. am not sure if this has been 
refaced.
OK, I have to confess, I did put it in the dishwasher to clean it 
and the heat caused the dis-coloration. 
I&#39;m sorry every one, I should have said it first.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hey, you&#39;re allowed. Just remember from this lesson - never use HOT water on a hard rubber mouthpiece. The Meguiar&#39;s products are auto polishes, so an auto supply shop should help you. The Flitz is a metal polish, and can be found in perhaps hardware stores, or in a music shop, as it&#39;s used here in the states on bare brass and such. You should find either online if you search a bit I think. If I come across a source for you I&#39;ll let you know.
