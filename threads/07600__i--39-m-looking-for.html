Anyone have any Yamaha sop and alto CM mouthpieces they want to part with? Also looking for a Yamaha sop 7C.

Thanks

Helped what particular quality?

I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re looking to the tip rail as a solution to a different
problem actually - which is the profile of the baffle in the zone of about
1/4" behind the tip rail.

Refacing alters this profile. And this can have a profound influence on how
the mouthpiece plays.

Moreover, it&#39;s a dicey bit of adjustment in my (albeit limited) experience.
It seems very sensitive to small changes. And I find it difficult to
actually measure the shape of the baffle in this area (if there is a good
way to do this, I&#39;d like to know it.) One needs some combination of a depth
gauge plus a way of setting the distance from the mouthpiece tip when
measuring.

I&#39;ve used a profile gauge as a way of comparing this baffle profile in one
mouthpiece that played well to another that didn&#39;t. Crude, but gets one into
the ballpark.

Yes, that is what I would aim for, 0.7mm to 0.8mm width.

I would classify wider than 0.8mm as a wide rail and less than 0.7mm as a thin rail.

However, tip rail widths up to 1mm are not uncommon. Thin tip rails can give an easier response but do mean you have to have a reed shape with a close fit in order to get a good seal.

To ascertain the baffle shape right behind the tip rail, I simply sight a small stainless steel ruler on edge against the baffle. This will give an idea of how much curvature there is there. If the baffle is too high it will choke off the sound or even touch the reed prior to the rail, resulting in a tendency to squeal or chirp.

Regards,
Andrew

Yes, I use all kinds of thicknesses. Thinner ones (like .018" thick) articulate well but can be prone to squeaking depending on the players embouchure. Thin can sound rich in overtones and/or edgy. Thin also requires a good fit to the shape of the reed tip. So I prefer not to go below .024" or so.

I ran across an interesting bit of Benade, IIRC, in which
he strongly recommends a cutting a groove in the baffle
just behind the tip rail to optimize the response of the
reed aeroacoustically. I personally have always found that
taking some material off just behind the tip rail helps to
keep the reed from chirping, although I have never gone so
far as to actually cut a step behind the tip rail. However
it is certainly true that refacing can effectively raise
the height of the baffle just behind the tip rail, and you
might have to cut that back down after finishing the
reface in order to get response similar to what you had
originally.

I&#39;m not sure we can blame chirping on thin tip rails. I had the pleasure of trying several Meyer Brothers pieces a few weeks ago -- altos and baris. They all had hairline tip rails -- not just thin, but all but non-existent. Every one of them articulated very very well, even on reeds that don&#39;t line up perfectly. At best I think maybe a wider tip rail tends to dampen all vibration of the reed, incuding the tendency to vibrate at its on frequency (chirping), as wider side rails do. This can inhibit a tendency to chirp that has another cause (asymmetry, too-high baffle, etc.).

FWIW, I routinely use pretty thin tip rails, almost always &lt;.5mm, unless I&#39;m trying to darken/deaden the sound of a piece.
