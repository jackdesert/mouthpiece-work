JodyJazz, and Jody is a long time friend and frequent house guest here at my
home in New Orleans) and have always considered them to be among the very
finest mouthpieces available anywhere at any price. The workmanship is of
the very highest quality, and I never saw one that didn&#39;t measure right on
the money. Like all mouthpieces, the ultimate result may or may not be to
your personal preference, but these are well worth a look. I&#39;m inclined
towards all sorts of mysticism, and am a big believer in numerical symmetry.
Jody may well be onto something here, although I am not capable of
understanding it or explaining it.

I worked on 2 6M HR* alto pieces over the weekend.  On both, the facing curve was quite crooked from the break all the way up to the tip.  Are these pieces CNC as well?

That said, after evening them up, the alto player sounded beautiful on them despite what looked like a smallish chamber to me.

I&#39;ve never got on well with any of JJ tenor pieces.

I too am skeptical of the golden section gimmick.  Where exactly is this number used?  Chamber?

Lol.  Yeah, squirrely.  Squeaks a bit too easily is all I mean by it.  All of the JJ metal pieces I&#39;ve seen were well made, just a couple of things about the design that don&#39;t suit me as a player.

      This is from his website   describing the mouthpiece:

"Phi Proportions - Or the Golden Section Proportioning.                                     The proportions that are found in the Stradivarius Violin, the                                     Nautilus shell, the dolphin, human beings, the Ancient Pyramids                                     and much more, are used for the first time on a saxophone                                     mouthpiece. These proportions result in a chamber that increases                                     harmonics making the sound bigger and richer.

I talked to a sax player this weekend who owns one and he says they are fantastic.
