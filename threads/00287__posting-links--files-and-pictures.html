            <pre class='message__body'>Members may post their own Links (Bookmarks), Files and Photos on the 
Yahoo Mouthpiece Work site.  There is no need to go through me.  If 
there is something there that I do not think is appropriate, I&#39;ll 
delete it.  I may also move it to another location to keep things 
organized.
