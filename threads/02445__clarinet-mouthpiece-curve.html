Hi.
Could you please give advice on the following curve.
The mouthpiece plays fairly well, but I would like to know
if subtle changes could be made to improve further...

Tip Opening is 1.2mm

feeler readings are
.0015 = 21mm
.010  = 12mm
.024  = 6mm
.034  = 3.7mm
.044  = 1.9mm

The readings are as accurate as I can obtain using my homemade
glass gauge

Your advice will be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks, Peter

I plotted the curve in Excel. The file is in the Files Clarinet area 
on the MouthpieceWork Site.

The curve looks tight and resistant to me.  But many clarinet players 
love their resistance.  If you do not, consider taking your .010" 
and .024" readings up 1 mm each.

I know enough about clarinet facing curves to know that I dont know 
enough about clarinet facing curves.  My favorite ones have flat 
sections in them.  I have heard these called "German" style facings.
"Parabolic" is also often used to describe some clarinet facings that 
get gradually flatter towards the tip.  I would expect these facings 
to have poor 3rd register response.  But what do I know?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your help Keith,
I have done as you suggested, opened up the 10, and 24 feeler reading by 
approximately 1mm
The 10 is now exactly 13mm
The 24 is now 6.9mm
This piece now really sings!!!
The free blowing / resistance balance is superb. This is now my #1 piece.
Thanks again for your help.
Peter
