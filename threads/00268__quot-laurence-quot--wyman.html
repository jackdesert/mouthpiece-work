Frederick Wyman wrote a very good paper in 1972 on the testing of several
alto sax mouthpieces.  It is listed in the Bookmarks on the MPwork site and
I have mentioned it a few times. 

I have emailed him a few times reguarding the paper and he has been going
by Laurance Wyman.  Laurence is not a middle name.

When Jim Reed posted the list of Sax Jornal mouthpiece article he found,
the first two are by Wyman: Frederick, then Laurence.

I decided to ask Wyman why, and I posted the reply.
