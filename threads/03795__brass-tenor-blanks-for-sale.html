            <pre class='message__body'>One of our "silent" members has been developing some nice mouthpieces 
in his machine shop.  He has sent a few blanks to me to review and 
offer for sale to the group at $100 each.  I have posted 4 photos of 
them in the Photos: Blanks-Tenor-LAW album.  

I think they are very high quality.  The initial facing it about a 4" 
radius that is .105" at the very tip and about 20mm long (40 on the 
glass gage).  

The baffle is a straight ramp to a "bullet" chamber.  Actually more of 
a nose cone shape.  The ramp is about the same angle as my Ponzol M1.

If anyone is interested, I have a few available now.  I&#39;ll answer 
follow-up questions too.  Fire away.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m using an 8* link on my Mk 6 tenor. I find the bottom end  ("E" down 
to lack depth and warmth. Would this mouthpiece be any better?

Not "as-is".  These are "blanks" which are unfinished mouthpieces.  
The rails, baffle, chamber and facing needs to be finished.  If 
desired, a bite plate pocket need to be made and filled with a bite 
plate.  Then the piece needs to be plated.

            <pre class='message__body'>Just some clarification, please.  For $100 is that the finished mpc or the blank?
Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>$100 + s/h is the cost for the blank alone.  How it gets finished is up to you.
