In my collection I have a STM and a Dukoff LD where the table is 
clearly at an angle to the mpc bore i.e. not at a right angle.
With the STM it seems the whole facing and baffle have been 
constructed from this altered position. With the Dukoff the whole 
facing seems to be twisted/assymetric such that the plane of the tip 
rail may even be rotated with respect to the table !!
I doubt this is intended
Neither of these pieces play well for me,.. surprise.
Both are untouched.
these seem like good practice candidates, what to do first?

	Mike:  I have worked on a number of Links like this... usually "New York" Links. 
The Babbit made ones are much better, which is strange, as people will play a premium
for the older Links.

Thanks for the comments Paul:

It is interesting that they bother to do all the finishing work on a 
blank like this.
The tab for the ligature is way off too.
Even if the facing and baffle are built in correct relation to each 
other there is no way a ligature(of any type but esp the link) can 
exert even pressure on the reed. It seems to me there will always be 
more pressure on the "high" side. The bad squeeks may then be leaks?

I guess I am mentioning this because a piece like this might have a 
facing curve that measures OK But you can see it&#39;s wrong Just by 
looking down the bore?
Or maybe it&#39;s just not that important?
