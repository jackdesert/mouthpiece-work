            <pre class='message__body'>Anyone tired or knows if CLR cleaner will work on mouthpieces, without damaging or discoloring them?
CLR stands for Calcium, Lime and Rust remover, It is sold at most supermarkets, home centers and super stores.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve never tried CLR, but lemon juice will remove calcium deposits 
without damaging the mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes lemon juice is it. It's more gentle and civilized than harsh chemicals. It  leaves the mouthpiece smelling good and you can cut another sliver of lemon to make yourself a drink.  You sometimes have to rub it on several times, but hey, you can always make yourself another drink.

supermarket, citric acid should do. Where to get it? Around here, at the 
Indian grocery store.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use CLR in  my repair workshop, and have done for years.  It works very
well, and unless the mouthpiece is excessively oxidised, has little effect
on the surface of the piece.  Rinse off in clear water and brush to remove
any gunk that&#39;s been loosened.  If you use soap and water then you&#39;ll
likely have the rubber turning green, but that&#39;s nothing to do with the CLR.



Best regards,
