            <pre class='message__body'>2 years ago I used 3d printing for prototyping.  A few things I found:
As has been mentioned,ABS plastic by wire is neither accurate nor hard enough.  You need to use sintering to get the accuracy we need.
I had several prototypes made, they played great right out of the box and were very close to the model, closer than I machine them, actually. They looked terrible, and the plastic that is stiff enough to be functional can never be made to look good, so it&#39;s out of the question so far for production.

I only used plastic, but this would work just fine with laser or electron beam sintering in steel or titanium.  But even with the difficulties involved in machining a large chamber mouthpiece it&#39;s still cheaper than printing one right now.  

Now that I have CNC production up and running I find it much quicker and cheaper to prototype in delrin, but if you&#39;re not doing the machining in house you can save a bundle prototyping like this.

cheers
Morgan

Only the wax machines used in jewelry making or the more traditional UV laser stereolithography machines would have a chance of making something like a mouthpiece.  Don&#39;t waste you time and money on an extruder based 3d printer for this application...

Oh, OK.  I thought you were using it as a way to manage chamber length to effect acoustic matching to the saxophone.

The shanks are interchangeable, so a specific mouthpiece can be matched to a specific horn.  How far can they adapt?  Can I use the same mouthpiece on an alto and tenor?

            <pre class='message__body'>The shanks are just shanks, representing the volume of the mouthpece from the neck opening to the throat aperture of the reed channel, and the amount of shank that goes on the cork.  They won&#39;t change a large chamber to a small chamber or visa-versa.  I can however, adapt a modern, small chambered mouthpiece design to play in tune on a vintage horn, or a large chambered mouthpiece design to play in tune on a modern horn.

            <pre class='message__body'>I missed something important; why threaded? I do not ask to antagonize or be a Luddite, but out of real curiosity. Conn and others ditched microtuners years ago. Although I still use them if they are not stuck. It is neat workmanship, but is that all? Is there a lock? I do not see one to prevent spinning and potential leaks. My threaded brass instrument mouthpieces fit tightly together with no gaps. Is it like that!

            <pre class='message__body'>I started out that way, like a Conn Adjustable, making the shank inserts vary in length.  That works.  Now I make the inserts all the same internal length, extending to (in a small/medium chamber mouthpiece) or creating (in a large chambed mouthpiece)  the reed channel&#39;s throat aperture, and vary the insert internal diameter/geometry.  So the body receiver plays no acoustical roll.  That give me more interesting possibilities.

Sure, but the shank receiver is larger than the bore it functions as a large throat area.  So you could have large chambers of differing volumes depending on how far out the shank/bore piece is.  Can&#39;t at the moment think of an equally elegant solution for small chambers.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is not a microtuner. It is simply a 2-part mouthpiece, in the same way your brass instrument, screw-on rim/cup combination is a 2-part mouthpiece. With so much surface area contact, air-tight tolerances would risk binding/freezing, especially stainless on stainless, so the O ring insures the seal.  If it comes unscrewed while tuning, your neck cork is too tight.  You can always tune clockwise then.

I missed something important; why threaded? I do not ask to antagonize or be a Luddite, but out of real curiosity. Conn and others ditched microtuners years ago. Although I still use them if they are not stuck. It is neat workmanship, but is that all? Is there a lock? I do not see one to prevent spinning and potential leaks. My threaded brass instrument mouthpieces fit tightly together with no gaps. Is it like that!
