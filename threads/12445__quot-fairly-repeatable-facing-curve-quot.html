            <pre class='message__body'>Good day fellow refacers
 

 

 I just want to clarify something
 

 

 It's about this phrase "Fairly Repeatable Facing Curve. 
 

 Correct me if I'm wrong.
 

 Does the phrase "Fairly Repeatable Facing Curve" mean: A facing curve that is similar between 2 or more mouthpieces may it be for beginner, intermediate, advanced/short, medium, long?
 

 

 Is my understanding correct? 
 

 

 Thank you

It could mean your ability to measure the same facing curve and get the same measurements.

Or, it could mean your ability to duplicate a facing curve to another mouthpiece.
