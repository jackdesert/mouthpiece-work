            <pre class='message__body'>Good day fellow refacers
 

 

 I just want to clarify something
 

 

 It's about this phrase "Fairly Repeatable Facing Curve. 
 

 Correct me if I'm wrong.
 

 Does the phrase "Fairly Repeatable Facing Curve" mean: A facing curve that is similar between 2 or more mouthpieces may it be for beginner, intermediate, advanced/short, medium, long?
 

 

 Is my understanding correct? 
 

 

 Thank you

            <pre class='message__body'>I may have said this but I would need to see in what context I used it.

It could mean your ability to measure the same facing curve and get the same measurements.

Or, it could mean your ability to duplicate a facing curve to another mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>here's your statement by the way 

 

 "Start by measuring, measuring, and more measuring.  You need to be able to get fairly repeatable facing curve measurements before you can use those readings to guide your work.  Hold a straight edge against the table to see if it is flat, wavy, concave or convex. If it is convex, note how this can affect your readings depending on how you hold the glass gauge against the table."

            <pre class='message__body'>You need to be able to judge if a bump you measured on a facing curve is a measurement error or is always there and is large enough that you should correct it.

            <pre class='message__body'>So that means "repeatable facing curve" is not a pattern between 2 or more mouthpiece? </pre>
