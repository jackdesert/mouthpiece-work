            <pre class='message__body'>There is not much out there  So if anyone has stuff, lets list it 
under this thread.

The Winslow Kit comes with a 12 page booklet of instructions.

"The Band Instrument Repair Manual" by Erick D. Brand has a chapter 
or two on refacing.  It is available through Ferree&#39;s.  I recommend 
getting it.

"The Saxophone Is My Voice" by Ernest Ferron has a discussion of 
mouthpiece chamber volumes and baffles.  The book is half about sax 
design and half about basic repairs.  It is translated from French.  
There is a clarinet book too which I have not seen.  The book is 
available from J.L.Smith.  (I have not been able to get to their web 
site lately, so they must be having problems.)  I recommend getting 
it.

I have the Bonade instrument accoustics book.  I dont have the exact 
title in front of me.  Tough reading, but it has good info on 
instument design and a little on mouthpices.

I have a PhD Thesis by Gary Paul Scavone I downloaded from 
somewhere.  It is called "An Acoustic Analysis of Single-Reed 
Woodwind Instruments with An Emphasis on Design and Performance 
Issues and Digital Waveguide Modeling Techniques".  March 1997.  I 
have a MSME but I&#39;m having trouble finding time to wade through its 
226 pages.

There are a number of US Patents available for download.  Mostly on 
odd-ball chamber designs.  I did not save the links.  Patents are 
tough reading too.  The pictures are neat though.

There are a number of articles written by Ralph Morgan for the 
Saxophone Journal.  Most do not get into the details enough to help.  
The best is the "A Meyer is not a Meyer" one.  It may still be 
available for download from the Dorn Publications site.

Santy Runyon wrote a few articles on Clarinet Mouthpieces for 
Woodwind World in 1960.  I&#39;m working on getting them posted to this 
site.

http://www.flutesmith.com/   They have a note that the shop does not
work with Netscape, use IE.

Is this in pdf or Word format?  Can you send me a copy via email?

            <pre class='message__body'>Just to be thorough I thought I&#39;d mention that general saxophone 
texts often have a section on mouthpiece types and how they generally 
play.  Two that I&#39;m aware of are:

The Art of Saxophone Playing - Larry Teal

Saxophone Altissimo - Dr. Robert Luckey

Paul Coats reported that Larry Teal drove over to interview Santy 
Runyon back in his Chicago days to get info for his book.  Earlier 
printings of the book had references to articles Santy wrote for 
other publications.  Paul managed to chase 3 of them down from a 
remote library and I obtained permission from Santy to post them in 
our file area.  They are titled "On The Clarinet Mouthpiece" so I put 
them in the clarinet section.  But they are relevent to saxophone 
mouthpieces too.  The copies are not great and are missing some words 
near the margins.  We&#39;ll get them re-typed and re-posted one of these 
days.

Here is what Santy said:

Date: Wed, 20 Mar 2002 08:34:03 -0600 (CST) 
Subject: Re: Permission to use mouthpiece articles by Santy 
        
Mr. Keith:
I received the copies of the articles, and I reviewed them.
I have no objection to your using them, and I beleive they will be
helpful,   so---Permission granted!!   More information in this 
regard will be forth-coming.   Please keep in touch,  Keith.

Sincerely
Santy

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith:  The three articles I fwd to you were not the 5 formerly in the
Bibliography of the Teal book.  Those are five MORE articles I have not
been able to locate.  Santy would like copies, too.

Perhaps in a college music library?

These articles were listed in the old printings of the Teal book, The
Art of Saxophone Playing, on page 111, under Periodicals.  Strangely, my
current new copy of The Art of Saxophone Playing only goes up to page
109.  The articles listed in the older printing are as follows:

Runyon, Santy.  "The Mouthpiece Story,"  Woodwind, 4:4, Feb, 1952; 6+,
March, 1952; 7+, April, 1952, 5+, May 1952, 8+, June, 1952.

These are earlier articles, and from a different publication (Woodwind
World), than the three I sent you, and were from 1960 issues.
