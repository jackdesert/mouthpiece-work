One of my friends left his case open and when he picked it up that 
mouthpiece that was in shattered in two parts they fit very precise so 
i was wondering what could i use as a very strong adhesive to put it 
back together?

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t see why not... I found my favorite bari mouthpiece had 
sustained some trauma on the tip and it broke part of the tip off. It 
was hanging by the mouthpiece patch. Since it is a precise break, that 
makes it a great candidate for something like superglue. I superglued 
it - it works fine - and you can&#39;t even tell it is cracked...
