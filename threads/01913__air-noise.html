            <pre class='message__body'>Hello to all,

 

I have a tenor Florida STM 9 reworked: it measures  0965  at the tip and 23 mm. facing length.

1)It has a little  air noise no matter wich reed is used and 2) it does not respond quickly on lower notes.

The curve has no kinks or flat parts; it is more convex (more close to the plane of the table) than a perfect circular arc especially in the part of the break.

As the owner das not want I rework the entire curve, are there specific areas of the curve to check to solve the mentioned problems ?(tip rail for 1? Break for 2?) 

Thanks in advance

Ciao Filippo

            <pre class='message__body'>Air noise can come from a leak under the table or a facing length that is
too long.  This is more of a gurgle sound.

Also, air noise can occur when the facing curve flips up a lot near the
tip.  The noise is heard at lower volumes.
