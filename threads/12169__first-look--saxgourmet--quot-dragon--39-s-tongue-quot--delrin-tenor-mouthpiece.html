            <pre class='message__body'>I think we’re pretty close to having this figured out now…..I am REALLY happy with this! There are still some details like ligatures etc. to be worked out, but AT LAST I think we have a product we believe you will find to be quite different and quite amazing…..Made in USA…..we ultimately hope to have an entire line of Delrin mouthpieces….we find Delrin to be an acoustically superior material which can also be machined extremely precisely…..this mouthpiece has a big window, extremely narrow rails, a pure radial curve, and a very pronounced “duck bill” beak…..I’m still not sure about the color of the final product……many, many thanks to Steve, Bill, and Ben at EMR Machine for making this happen!

This project has been in the works for a very long time, and I’m happy to be catching the first glimpse of light at the end of tunnel. I’ll keep you posted as details develop…...

Looks good, except for the tip rail that doesn&#39;t curve as does the
end of a reed, at least in this picture. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure that out
also, though. 

The shank looks pretty thin walled. Are you thinking of
banding them?
