            <pre class='message__body'>I thought it best to update you all on the tip gauges. 

 

Two weeks ago, my father-in-law had a heart attack that really put all of us
back on our heels. My wife is the only child, so the burden has fallen upon
us to take care of things. Dad&#39;s doing okay today, after having two stents
inserted in one of his major arteries, but things are very slow going. To
make a long story short, I have not been in the shop for the past two weeks.


 

I am going back to work today, but I will probably be working half days for
the next week or so. The only thing left on the gauges is to drill and tap
the base and assemble the pieces, so I hope to have that done over the
weekend and be shipping them out by the middle of next week. (I&#39;m waiting on
Allen wrenches to include in the package.)

 

Thanks for the patience.

 

Steve
