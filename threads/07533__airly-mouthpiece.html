            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, I refaced this new metal otto link i&#39;ve got and the thing plays really well, the only thing is it&#39;s got this really airy sound.  If i blow pretty hard it goes away but when i&#39;m playing soft to medium volume its pretty airy, especially in the mid register.  Anyone know why this might be?  Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>This can happen if the facing flips up a lot at the tip rail.  I first noticed it on Lakeys which often have this "feature".
