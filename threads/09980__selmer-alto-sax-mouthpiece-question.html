            <pre class='message__body'>Yes LT is Larry Teal. Fom what I read, can&#39;t remember where, Teal used the original soloist with the round chamber. When Selmer changed to the horseshoe chamber he complained that it had affected the sound advesely and persuaded them to make round chambered LT models... 

Afik the facings were the same. 

The S80 plays and sounds vey different to the soloists. 

If it&#39;s just the facing that&#39;s the issue here, perhaps a modern soloist with a horseshoe chamber will work, for alto a 170 would translate into C*.  

Ed Pillinge makes soloist replicas, but they have the horseshoe chamber (at least the one I have does). May be worth contacting him or another maker to see if they&#39;ll reproduce the LT. 

Another alternative may be to find a Brilhart Personaline W. These are white and have a brown, round bite plate built in. (aka Personaline Tonalin), these have a vey sweet core sound. But they&#39;re not too common and can be expensive. The 5 facing is about the same opening as the C* (.070", cf .067"). Watch for cracked shanks on these.

Actually, the LT&#39;s had a very small tip opening, I think .060"-.062" for the alto, and .066" for the tenor.  The facings were supposed to be longer than the C* facing, and these mouthpieces required a very hard reed.

The LT&#39;s round chamber was the same as the Selmer metal classical mouthpiece.
