            <pre class='message__body'>Greetings, Joe.
I had a level aire Brilhart alto piece with no bite plate, and have 
pictures in the  group&#39;s files under Brilhart. What I did was to cut a 
slice out of an old mouthpiece with a hacksaw. Then I took a rasp and 
improved the fit to the MP. Don&#39;t make it too smooth - give the epoxy 
something to bite on. I clamped and epoxied the plastic to the MP, then 
after it set up, I filed it to clean up the edges and added a stick on  
tooth pad (optional). Hour of puttering, worked great! JimG
