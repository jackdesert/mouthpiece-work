Keith, you have one on your site that you have done a Dukoff with  the 
curve at +3 and 1/2 eliptical.  How does this change the playability of 
the piece as against a radial curve?
Thanks

I am currently working on a Dukoff D8 which I intend to improve the 
playability up to as close to a Guardala MB1 as I am able. 
Keith, you have one on your site that you have done a Dukoff with the
