For two reasons, I think that the piece was not made on May 1, 1969.

First, I have a LevelAir tenor piece that I got in the early sixties 
and the serial number was "xx77". So that number could not represent 
the manufacture date. I suspect that Brilhart did not use the 
manufacture date as a serial number until sometime later.

Second, I would think that Brilhart would always use a two digit 
number for the day, so that they could tell a piece made on, for 
example, December 1 from one manufactured on January 21. Without a 
two digit day, both pieces would be numbered "121yy". With it, they&#39;d 
be "1201xx" and "121xx" respectively.

It&#39;s interesting that the date numbered pieces start with the month, 
not the year. It gives the piece manufactured in January a lower 
number than the one manufactured the month before.

            <pre class='message__body'>Gregg&#39;s logic makes a lot of sense.  I know the early Brilhart LAs did not
use the date as a serial number.  But I do not think I&#39;ve seen an example
with a leading zero in the date like "01".  As for the 121yy confusion, I
think they may have just avoided marking batches of pieces made on
confusing days.  But I do not know for sure.
