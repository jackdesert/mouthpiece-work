            <pre class='message__body'>I think it took WW&B 8 months to ship my morgan kit.  I think the only substantial thing the morgan kit offers that you might have trouble finding is the tip wand; but others know better than I. Of course, I am having a little trouble finding .0015 feeler gauges.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Ferree Tool sells the Morgan kits. I&#39;ve not had any trouble getting
.0015 feelers in sets at Auto Zone.
 
BTW, Keith, thanks for the great pics of the Link STM work in progress.
