            <pre class='message__body'>I will be doing the detailed design work for these soon.  I&#39;m planning 
on a 6 reed set: SATB, clar, bass clar.

I need help deciding on a metal thickness.  I was originally thinking 
of 1 mm = .040".  But it may be more useful if te thickness was thin 
enough to flex some without bending.  This would allow the reed to be 
clamped or held against the table while pressing the tip down to see 
how well the mouthpiece tip curve matches the reed.  Test flexing my 
feeler gages, is seems like .016"-.020" is a better thickness for this.

Any opinions?

Hi Keith:

I think that for more open facings that .012" to .016" would be pliable 
enough to serve it&#39;s purpose and still be durable enough to last for 
these metal reed tools.  So one vote for .016"

            <pre class='message__body'>Did you measure the thickness of the metal reed that you currently have?

No, because it is too thick and will not bend. The person who fashioned 
this particular aluminum reed tool did not take into consideration the 
necessity of bending the tool with the curve of the mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think some pliability is a good thing, and once they&#39;re bent in the
general shape of a facing they can just stay that way anyhow, almost
self-adjusting to whatever facing you happen to be working with.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry for the shipping delay.  My shipping department (wife) works 
seasonally at the local music store.  This week is a heavy "show and 
rent" week to the local schools.  So she&#39;s been working days and 
evenings.  Should ship by Monday.

Only about half of those who said they were interested have placed 
orders.  I need the other half to break even.  So dont be shy.
