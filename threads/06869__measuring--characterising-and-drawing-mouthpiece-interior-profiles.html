            <pre class='message__body'>I am interested in making a drawing of the inside of some good playing sax mouthpieces.  Initially just the contour/shape of the baffle and chamber along the centre line of the piece like the drawings in Wyman&#39;s paper on alto sax chamber designs.

Wyman&#39;s paper describes his methodology for measuring the baffle contour, but do any of the members of this group do something simpler or better ?

The drawings in Wyman&#39;s paper also show the cross-sections at the throat and one inch from the tip rail.  With complex internal designs, like bullets, steps and concave sidewalls, is this enough to describe/characterise a mouthpiece design ?

And finally, does anyone have a basic drawing of a sax mouthpiece (alto or tenor) that they could share ?

Thanks

Rhys

I&#39;ve used a  wire contour gauge, eg.
