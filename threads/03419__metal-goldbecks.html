            <pre class='message__body'>Anybody know what these are made out of?  I&#39;ve worked on a few of them 
and they appear to be some type of cast Nickel(?).  Some have 
corrosion areas that may be due to specks of Iron contanmination.  

I may be able to get the lab at my day job to analyze it...
