            <pre class='message__body'>Hi All,

I&#39;m new and very surprised my application was accepted fast as it
was.  Question - Saw a site called Mouthpiece Works,POB 1111,
Bedford, TX  76095-1111.  Mailed a couple mpcs and two weeks later
get them returned along with unanswered emails. Can somebody tell
me what&#39;s the deal?  Thanks

Sincerely,
Harry

            <pre class='message__body'>The Mouthpiece Works site has nothing to do with this Yahoo Mouthpiece Work
site.  It was set-up by Joe Smallwood who apparently is not in business
anymore.  It is puzzling why the site is still active.
