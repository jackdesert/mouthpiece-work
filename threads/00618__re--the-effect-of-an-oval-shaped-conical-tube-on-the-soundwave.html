            <pre class='message__body'>Some observations on this:

The formula for determining the cross sectional area of an elliptical (just a special circle) air column is:

area =PI*a*b

       where:

 b is the distance from the center to a co-vertex 
 a is the distance from the center to a vertex 

If pull-down resulted in the perfectly round cross-section of my Martin Medalist neck, at the 23mm diameter end of the neck tube, just above the tenon, so that it was stretched/compressed +/- 2mm (dims then being 25mm x 21mm), the resultant loss in area would be less than 1% (0.76%, or 3.14 mm2).  

Certainly, anyone who found their neck so deformed by 2mm each way would consider it a major disaster.   It is interesting to note though, and it does say a lot about the way people are conditioned to think (or rather, not think) about their instruments, that while this 0.76% loss in cross sectional area would be considered a serious problem, starting less than 1mm down the tube, the cylindrical tenon bore error causes typically (best possible scenario on this alto) the cross sectional area to be 7.12% too large at one end and 7.12% too small at the other - ten times as extreme as the disasterous neck pull-down.  The actual Martin tenon, in this case is 8.51% too small at the top and a whopping, 20.67% too small at the bottom.  

I&#39;m inclined to think that, were the tenon bore errors visible externally, as dents or pull-down damage, no one would buy the instrument.  So, should one be concerned about neck pull-down, acousticall?  No, not if you are happy with your neck tenon the way it is.  There is no reason to be:-)

What are the noticeable effects of neck pull-down, tenon errors, or chewing gum in the neck air column?   Loss of tonal center and focus, and some instability of intonation.  This loss will be considerably less than that caused by a moderate mouthpiece volume/frs mismatch and/or poorly developed embouchure/upstream resonator control, so many saxophone owners won&#39;t actually notice any difference.
