I have a Dukoff D9 I picked up.  Hacked on chamber that I have cleaned 
up a bit.  I need a good facing too.  You are reputed to be the man for 
Dukoffs.  What facing numbers do you suggest for a .125?  A medium or 
medium long facing would be fine as its a larger tip than Im used 
to..or what ever you suggest.  

thanks

I may have done only one that large out of 40 or so I&#39;ve done.  I 
would use a verly long facing length with larger tips.  50-52.  But 
that is not unique to Dukoffs.  I would do that on any larger tip 
opening.  The other target numbers depend on your feeler set.  I&#39;d get 
them off the spreadsheet calculation.
