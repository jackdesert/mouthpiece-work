I find if the table is concave, you can lap in many directions and still make progress.  But if it is convex, the leading edge of you lap direction tends to dig into the sandpaper and you can easily make the table even more convex.  So you need to be aware of this and compensate by how you grip the mouthpiece and apply some force to it as you draw it.  I have a slide show presentation on my site that illustrates what I&#39;m talking about.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I've found it useful to take the .0015 measurement with my thumb close to the
glass gauge marking I'd expect (like pressing my thumb on the gauge around 60
for a tenor piece), then checking it with my thumb pressing much farther down
the gauge (near the heel of the table). If the measurement is the same, the
table should be flat. This won't detect a concave table, but if I've been
flattening it with sandpaper on plate glass, it won't be concave - the only
problem would be if it were convex (i.e., had a higher spot somewhere in the
middle), and this finds it pretty well.

What is your tolerance for this Dan?
I wanted to ask the forum this question long time ago.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think he was asking how much do you allow the facing length measurement to change as you move your thumb down the glass gage.  I think your answer is "none".

I also find if the glass gage is hard to hold in place and wants to swivel under your thumb, you have a high spot on the table.  You can also feel if you have a grain of sand from the sand paper between the table and the glass gage.  This scratches up your gage over time.  So you need to get in the habit of trying to keep make these surfaces clean before measuring.

I don&#39;t know what the tolerances are - I just know that if the .0015 feeler stays put, the table isn&#39;t convex for the practical purposes of refacing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Another test of a "true" table is the method of moderately wetting the table and adhering the mouthpiece to the glass with the mouthpiece under the glass.  If it stays put and does not rotate or fall off for a good length of time you have a level table.  

Be ready to catch the mouthpiece or have padding beneath to prevent damages from the forces of gravity.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Yes, true - thanks for clarifying. With metal mouthpieces in particular,
setting it on glass and trying to gently spin it can find major high spots -
tap the side of the shank and see if it spins at all. It's a pretty coarse
test, but it can graphically illustrate to the client that his mouthpiece has
a convex table.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: basics of getting a flat table

  
Another test of a "true" table is the method of moderately wetting the table and adhering the mouthpiece to the glass with the mouthpiece under the glass. If it stays put and does not rotate or fall off for a good length of time you have a level table. 

Be ready to catch the mouthpiece or have padding beneath to prevent damages from the forces of gravity.

the table versus the bottom no matter how flat the table is you will get at
least 1mm different reading due to the lever principles. That for the metal
pieces. On some softer HR you may get same reading. So that 1mm is my
margin.

...There should be no rocking of the gauge on a FLAT table.

I am having success holding my 1ft(30cm) steel ruler up to the light, lengthwise and across the table surface. This shows humps or hollows. 

Sliding the ruler edge, gently across the table a few times lengthwise, also shows up all the high spots on the surface of the table, even on brass.

I then hold the MPC in one hand while sanding these out. Continuously repeating these visual tests with the ruler, until it is ready for a final sanding on the glass plate.

I find this gives more control than using flat plate sanding alone and reduces the tendency to dig-in on the leading edge of the forward stroke, if you already have a hump. 

This gets humps down faster without closing the tip unnecessarily, thereby reducing the amount of relaying required IMO.

---Glad to be of help Peter. I developed the technique after trying unsuccessfully to flatten a Weltklang table which had a hard lump imbedded in it. This refused to sand down at the same rate as the surrounding material.

It is a hobby and a learning curve for me.....pun intended. Eddie.

With your method, it seems that there is a high possibility of creating a high spot in the center of the table if you are not holding the mouthpiece firm enough.  Is there a way to avoid this?
The only why I have been able to make a good flat (which I don&#39;t do a lot, I like a slight hollow) is to sand lengthwise, holding the MPC firmly, but with very little pressure downward.  It takes a bit of time, but it does come out flat eventually.
It is very very hard to avoid the leading edge becoming more sanded than the rest of the table.

  His comment was that if you don&#39;t hold the mouthpiece correctly, you won&#39;t get proper results. My comment is simply in agreement, nothing more. We sell a DVD at www.nationofmusic.com which shows and explains the procedure in detail. 



  I don&#39;t see how my comment was a harangue or anything but helpful, or was in any way contrary to the intent of this board. That was certainly not my intent, and if my comment was taken that way, I apologize.

      I think that I&#39;m safe to say that if you cannot figure out how to hold the mouthpiece, you should most likely not be attempting any refacing or leveling.....

        Steve,
        With your method, it seems that there is a high possibility of creating a high spot in the center of the table if you are not holding the mouthpiece firm enough. Is there a way to avoid this?
        The only why I have been able to make a good flat (which I don&#39;t do a lot, I like a slight hollow) is to sand lengthwise, holding the MPC firmly, but with very little pressure downward. It takes a bit of time, but it does come out flat eventually.
        It is very very hard to avoid the leading edge becoming more sanded than the rest of the table.

            <pre class='message__body'>It is true that  when we get past those nice milling marks on certain brands of mouthpiece, underneath them there is often a very unlevel table with only the ridges giving it a semblance of flatness.
   When these ridges wear down in time with the continuous beating of the reed against them  we are often left with a very uneven table. This applies even more to the side rails, leaving a rather inaccurate curve. Of course the softer the mouthpiece material the worse this  gets.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, 

I agree about the hand method and do flatten all rubber and composite mouthpieces by hand. I have however had very good outcomes with the mill on metal mouthpieces and again I say that the trick is to get the mouthpiece perfectly flat in the mill holding device which does take some expertise and patience. Especially the harder material metal mouthpieces it just takes to long and the variables of removing the material by hand are tedious at best and subject to some removal of material from one side or the other or back or front by an imperfect or fatigued hand. The mill is actually scientifically flat if the mouthpiece is put on flat to the holding device.

One thing I struggled with a whole lot at first was learning not to apply much pressure to the mouthpiece from the top when flattening a table. The very first mouthpiece I tried to work on, I (mistakenly) figured that it must take a lot of downward pressure while making passes on the sandpaper to flatten a table. I thought the harder you pressed down, the more flat the table got. However, I quickly found out that putting downward pressure on the mouthpiece while making sandpaper passes will cause you mouthpiece to develop a lot of convexity, and I eventually ruined that mouthpiece... But, after someone pointed out my mistake, it became clear that you don&#39;t need to really do anything but hold the mouthpiece steady as you make sandpaper passes on your flat working surface (i.e. glass plate or granite bench block or whatever), and then you can just let the flat working surface do its job of flattening the table. It seems like it works much better just to use very light pressure, basically just enough to hold the mouthpiece on the sandpaper steadily/evenly, as you make passes on your flat working surface with the mouthpiece table. It takes quite a bit of time sometimes to get a table flattened, especially if you&#39;re trying to remove a damaged spot such as a deep scratch or knick in the table, but it seems to only work well for me to use light pressure to sand the table. 
I have, however, started gripping the mouthpiece a little more firmly than before because if you don&#39;t hold it firmly enough, the mouthpiece can shift around in your grip as you make passes and cause problems as you&#39;re trying to flatten the table - meaning that although no more downward pressure than normal is added to the sandpaper passes, you just hold the mouthpiece a little more firmly from the sides as you make passes to keep the mouthpiece moving steadily without "catching" on the sandpaper. I usually use 400 grit to sand tables on hard rubber, and then 600 grit for the facing work on hard rubber. 
I like the idea that Morgan Fry has of using a flat surface to test for table flatness visually by holding the table on the flat surface and holding it up to the light. And as people have already mentioned before, I&#39;ve definitely found that it helps to keep an eye on the bottom of the table between sandpaper passes to make sure material is being removed from where you want. I was working on a damaged trial-model Bari Associates soprano mouthpiece last night that I got for cheap a long time ago from a music store, and one of the problems was that there was this really weird circular high spot in the table near the left-back part of it. It was several millimeters wide, no idea where it came from and it didn&#39;t become apparent until a pass was made on the sandpaper to check for table flatness. Took a long time to get it out, but after a bunch of passes gradually it became smaller until it went away. Thankfully the tip didn&#39;t get closed up too much after that either, maybe only about .010".

In the Erik Brand repair manual, page 127 shows a drawing of the grip
for getting a flat table under topic Lapping the Table.

Thanks for posting the steps AND materials. The manual talks about 4/0
and 8/0 pouncing paper. Ask for that in an American hardware store and
they send you to the Disneyland to see Tigger and Pooh.

Also, thanks for the clarinet ideas in the other posts lately!
