            <pre class='message__body'>Runyon magazine ad from the 1990&#39;s......I&#39;m holding "Big Mambo", my 30M......Jody Espina and I were both students of Santy Runyon during this era......check out Jody&#39;s outfit.......note dangling saxophone earring.......I used to buy those by the case and present them to young women who had met certain "tests"........the coat I&#39;m wearing in that picture was a very shiny silver satin with a tiny sequin in the middle of each square which looked great under stage lights!.....I&#39;m not real sure about that particular hat, though
