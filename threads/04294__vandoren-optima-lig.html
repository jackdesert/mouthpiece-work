Any thoughts?

Vandoren, Selmers and Morgan fit.

The V16 metal does not fit a lot of tenor mouthpieces.  So I gave up
trying.   Recently I tried it on a Link and I was suprised it fit.  But I
like the simplicity of a 404 lig on a Link.

The Vandoren "Optimum" tenor lig was a bit too large for my Ponzol M1.

I cut a small cylindrical plastic pill container to shape, and super-glued
it into place as a "lining" for the ligature, to shim it out to fit the
Ponzol. This has worked well.

Like mouthpieces, there is no single ligature design that works for
everyone.  

The Winslow is probably more adjustable/configurable than any other
ligature ever made.  It can be configured in a dozen or more different ways
by moving several reed contact points among a 3 x 3 grid (9 locations). 
The idea is to test various configurations out to see what works best for
your mouthpiece and reed choice.  This can take hours.  But once you
determine a good arrangement, you can just use it without doing any
follow-up testing.  

I like them.  But I also use other ligatures that work great, or good
enough, and cost a lot less.  Rovner Lights are a great value.
