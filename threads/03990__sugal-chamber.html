            <pre class='message__body'>I got a Sugal Gonz II 8* on internet and bought at nice price. Than I
analyze the inside chamber... how many imperfection are there!
Mp play quiet good, but it&#39;s not confortable for pianissimo on the low
notes.
I need to understand if I can feel this piece better giving up the
wrong level right/left inside the chamber or if this imperfection
involve the sound and I can correct. In theory all have to be perfect
pair and looking for it from the neck side hole I can see well is not
centered, and from window I&#39;ve seen there are like two small grinded
holes of 2 mm., on a corner where the roof is going into the bore, and
only on the right side... than left opposite side is smooth and flat !!!
So two options... or Gary was so drunk to start to grind only one side
and forgot the other, or there is a reason for that, a specifical
reason that I would like to know... if was made on purpose.
Somebody can help on this point?
Gian

It may look bad but sloppy chamber work does not affect how a mouthpiece
plays very much.  The quality of the tip rail and the facing curve is more
important.

I have a Sugal to work on now.  This one is the first Sugal I have seen
with a decent facing and tip rail on it.  So they do exist.  

Many of the mouthpieces he sells on eBay are really sloppy ones that no one
would buy at full price.

Hi:

Not to pimp Sugal, but I got to tell you, I have a
Super Gonz II 8 that is really a killer piece,
especially for commercial stuff.

By the way, has anyone noticed that the Jody Jazz EXP
metals are unusally dark without the spoiler?  Kind of
like a New York Link on steroids. 

Bob
