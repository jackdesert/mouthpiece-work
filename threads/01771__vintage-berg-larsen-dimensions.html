            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:

First of all, this site is great!  Now a question.  I recently 
aquired a Berg Larsen Metal bullet chamber 110/2 M, (stainless).  It 
currently measures: Tip: 265, 50 40 30 26 20.  I would like to get it 
up to an actual .110.  Any suggestions on the measurements on the 
facing curve for the .110 facing?

Thanks, Bluesnote

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Vintage Berg Larsen Dimensions</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>MOST of the curve would be the same, with only the slightest change on 
the .024", .031" (or .035"), .048" (or .050") and larger feelers.  Only 
about a 1mm change on the .063" and .077" feelers.

How are your spreadsheet skills?  Have you tried to use the sample facing
curve spreadsheet on the site?  I can give you a fish, or try to teach you
to fish...

What is that?  Does it give measurements, because that
would be sweet. How do I get to it.

Thanks for the tip on the larger feeler gauges.  Cool.
