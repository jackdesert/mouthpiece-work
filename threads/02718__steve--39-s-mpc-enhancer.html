I was just thinking: changing the inner diameter of the mpc throat (which is basically what your enhancer does to match the neck opening, right?) should actually alter the tuning in the very highest notes--for better or worse. I was wondering if you had noticed any differences in intonation up in the palms and altissimos with and without the enhancer in place. 

It might be worth checking--it could be another selling point if it pulls things more in tune.

Hi Steve and all,
 
I was just thinking: changing the inner diameter of the mpc throat (which is
basically what your enhancer does to match the neck opening, right?) should
actually alter the tuning in the very highest notes--for better or worse. I
was wondering if you had noticed any differences in intonation up in the
palms and altissimos with and without the enhancer in place. 
 
It might be worth checking--it could be another selling point if it pulls
things more in tune.
