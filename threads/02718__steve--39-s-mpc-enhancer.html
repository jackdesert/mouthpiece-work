            <pre class='message__body'>RE: [MouthpieceWork] Re: Large chambersHi Steve and all,

I was just thinking: changing the inner diameter of the mpc throat (which is basically what your enhancer does to match the neck opening, right?) should actually alter the tuning in the very highest notes--for better or worse. I was wondering if you had noticed any differences in intonation up in the palms and altissimos with and without the enhancer in place. 

It might be worth checking--it could be another selling point if it pulls things more in tune.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes. It seems to bring sharp palm key notes into line. However, we haven&#39;t
tried this with enough different horns to be ready to make this claim.
