            <pre class='message__body'>OK, I&#39;ve got most of my tools together now. I&#39;m just waiting on my 
glass gauges.

I&#39;ve got the Brand book section on refacing, and I&#39;m digesting that, 
along with the info on here.

I also managed to snag a couple of handfuls of damaged Selmer S80 
m/p&#39;s to practice on. Man! they&#39;ve got nearly non-existent tip rails!

What should I used for small chip repair in HR pieces? I&#39;m talking 
about chips that are not on the tip or rails...

2-part epoxy JB Weld is good to work with.  Its a dark gray color.  For
black, Ferree&#39;s sells a Jet Black.  Its not as creamy as JB Weld, but works.
