            <pre class='message__body'>I think more friends, with better knowledge of that, will tell you later about Guardala. I play Morgan Excalibur on alto and Barone on tenor, and I experienced Guardala a couple of time. Never heard anyway about a MB made in laser trimmed. Similar of it is the Studio model. Unfortunately I know that Guardala today have a production of mp made as franchising. In Europe, for example, a dutch factory made Guardala and distribute too! So, as you can well understand, one thing is the master make the mp and another is he let other to... have a big business together.
 Personally I like person like Mojo... still able to talk to you about your mp, about how to make it better, and without have the market crazy for him just because one day a Brecker was passing there... but I would like to see on the box of Michael how many mps are there!

            <pre class='message__body'>Pictures I have seen of the LT MB2 indicate that it is a MB2 in name 
only.  Its baffle and chamber design resembles a Guardala King.  Dave&#39;s 
original partner is Jeff Powell.  He is also the co-holder of 2 patents 
with Dave Guardala.  Jeff has posted that he believes these are 
unauthorized editions of Guardalas.  The German merchant claims Dave 
Guardala authorized him to make these.  It is difficult to determine 
the truth but the facts are that these are being sold and they do not 
appear to be copies of handmade MB2s.
