            <pre class='message__body'>Hi!
I read the article Mojo on Reworking Steps.doc and I found this step
10 that I would like to know more about it.   

"10. Go for the final facing curve.  Start play testing.  You&#39;ll start
to develop a feeling for how some minor changes make a big difference
while others are not worth messing with."

Where on the facing curve minor changes make big difference and where
they are not? 
I &#39;m sure the knowledge of it will benefit many. 
Thank you
