            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been trying to work backwards from a lot of the numbers that 
Ralph Morgan published some years ago in regards to the facing curves

Actually I&#39;m only partially serious.  I know we&#39;ve had some

degree.  Needless to say my brain hurts.

I have access to a whole bunch of old reeds and I think I&#39;m going to 
measure them.

I&#39;ve picked up a lot of great information from the list and I hope 
someone can shed some light on some of this.

The facing numbers Ralph published in the Sax Journal are from an 
earlier printing of the Erick Brand manual.  I can only speculate how 
they were determined.  If they are from measurements of one example 
of each mouthpiece, we know that mouthpieces are not that 
consistent.  I have spot checked a few vintage Woodwind mouthpiece 
facings against the charts and they do not agree that well.  Just 
Ballpark.  If you plot the curves, some are erratic shapes.  I 
concluded they were not that usefull.  I think if you use them as 
standards, you will be repeating some facing errors in your facings.

Ralph makes great mouthpieces, but he is not real articulate when it 
comes to explaining technical things.  He either does not fully 
understand the theory or is just not a great communicator.  I think 
the charts he uses were once derived from a reed cut.  The curvature 
of the facing depends on the the thickness of the reed cross secion.  
So the facing curve would have a shorter radius as it approaches the 
tip.  How much so would depend on some scaling factors (theoretical 
or emperical) and the reed cut used.  Alexander has 3 reed cuts.  
Vandoren has more.  What about reed strength?  

I&#39;ve only measured a few Morgan pieces.  Not enough to determine what 
kind of curve he is shooting for.  They vary some, like most 
mouthpieces.

I use some elliptical facing curves that deviate from a pure radial 
curve.  But I have not found them to be significantly better than a 
well-constructed radial curve.   They usually blow with a little more 
resistance and edge, which some players actually like, some dont.  
Ponzols and most Bergs seem to have elliptical facings.  Bergs vary a 
lot.  But metal Ponzol tenors have ellipses where the major axis is 5 
times the minor axis.  This sounds like a lot, but only a very small 
section of the the ellipse is used for a facing curve.  You&#39;ll need 
to work out the math yourself.

I concluded early on that constructing my own facing curves using a 
spreadsheet was superior to measuring and duplicating facings from 
even good pieces.  You can get good results from duplication, but you 
always risk duplicating facing errors too.  It is tough to know what 
is an error and what is a desirable feature.  Some flat spots were 
desirable since they were a method of adding edge to a piece.  But I 
think they hurt response and there are other ways of adding edge 
besides messing with the facing curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve plotted a number of pieces this week using some of the wonderful spreadsheets that you have posted.  I started out by plotting the curve differences between a radial curve, parobolic curve, and the published curves.  After going through this excercise I was able to conclude that most of the published numbers match up better to a radial curve but are not exact.  I then repeated the process with all of my Morgan pieces and came to a similar conclusion.

I measured the pieces that I had that were on the list and like Mojo found that they varied - sometimes quite a bit.

I wonder if they weren&#39;t simply working off of some accepted ratios related to reed thickness or they may have been simply derived from trial and error.

My goal of this excercise was to try and work through the numbers in order to get a better feel for any school of thought of the old makers.  Thus far, I haven&#39;t really accomplished that goal.  But it was interesting anyways.

I&#39;m thinking that what Ralph didn&#39;t say was that his pieces are designed around a given reed (which guys like Phil point out about their pieces).  I&#39;m still planning on doing some measuring of a lot of the really old reeds that I have in the hopes of generating some standard numbers.  Thankfully most of the old reeds that I have are original and have not been worked over.

I remember commenting years ago that I wouldn&#39;t ever find a need for any of the advanced math I took in High School and College.  Lately, I&#39;ve been using most of the stuff I figured I could forget!

Putting a good curve on a piece that allows it to perform as well as possible is the goal.
I wonder how the major companies like Runyon and others decide on their curves.

Keith:

I could use the following tip opening plus facing
schedules for a Selmer table stamp D soprano piece in
hard rubber, also, for an E.

I appreciate your time,

            <pre class='message__body'>Greetings,
I am in receipt of my new (stainless steel)  Berg Larsen 110/0M. It was 
a new "B stock" MP, which the vendor claimed meant that it was 
cosmetically flawed but it would have nothing to do with function. 
Therein lies my question. (Asked because I can return it.) The only flaw 
is a small casting flaw right at the very tip. About a fingernail width, 
it goesparallel to the lenght of the MP, and if one closes off the end, 
you can see light though it - perhaps the size of a sewing thread. What 
say you? Play it and forget it? Put on a day of epoxy and sand it down? 
Thanks for any input. By the way, the B stock did lower the price to 
around $125, so it was a considerable savings for a new MP. Thanks for 
any input. JimG

            <pre class='message__body'>If the void goes through the tip rail, you will need to fill it in with
epoxy.  $125 does not sound like a super great deal unless it is the newest
edition of Bergs instead of new old stock.  I have not seen the new ones
but I&#39;m hopin they are worth their higher price.

I would be inclined to buy a Berg on eBay if I wanted to fix one up.

I can generate what I would use, but I do not know Selmer&#39;s specs.

What set of feelers are you using?

Look in the Files Clarinet section for an article by Santy Runyon.  This
gets you into his head a little.  

He decided radial facings were the best for his goals and even designed a
machine that makes only radial facings.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Old Mouthpiece Makers</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>Ed:   Runyon, for the most part, has medium length facings on all of 
their mouthpieces.  There are a few exceptions, such as the Jaguars are 
1mm longer.

They keep the facing length constant, and vary the tip opening. 

They have two facing machines.  One is their "old facing machine", which 
is infinitely adjustable.  It moves the cutter along a straight track, 
cutting the table.  Then it hits a stop, and rotates on a radius, 
cutting the facing curve.  This is the arc of a perfect circle.

The mouthpiece is put in a fixture that exactly fits the contour of the 
top half of the mouthpiece and supports the bore section and beak.  
There is a bar that goes into the bore and is clamped down to hold the 
mouthpiece solidly in place.

By adjusting where the pivot is, they can adjust length of facing.  By 
adjusting length of radius, they adjust tip opening.

This "old facing machine" takes about 1 minute to cut the table and 
facing, and is used for all of the Customs, and other pro plastic and 
metal mouthpieces.

The "new facing machine" (which is about 25 years old) works like a key 
copier.  It works by use of a "template" (like copying the original key) 
to guide the cutter.  The template is made on the "old machine". 

The mouthpiece is clamped into a similar fixture, and the cutter cuts 
the facing following the template.  It is very fast, and cuts the facing 
in under 1 second.   Cutting the facing on both machines is done under a 
jet of water to cool the cutting tool and mouthpiece.

It takes far more time to place a blank in the fixture, ZAP!--the facing 
is cut, then to remove it, than the actual cutting of the facing.

This new machine is used for the various student models, where very 
large numbers are done with a single facing.

By measurement, I see that most of the Runyon baris are 24 mm long 
facings, tenors 22 mm, altos 21 mm.  And this seems to be "medium" and 
used by other makers.

Those are the tip openings I used in the spreadsheet I posted.  However, I
used 20 mm facing lengths.  I think I found them on a Selmer web site. 
Perhaps the vintage ones are shorter.  Like you said, they vary a lot.  I
use a S80 C* on my Asian curved sop sax but it measures as a D.

            <pre class='message__body'>Here&#39;s what Selmer has listed as their current Soprano specs:

I wonder if Selmer is using 20mm as the 0 feeler rather than .0015.  I would think 18mm would be a more reasonable facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>I got 16mm (with .0015" feeler) from actual measurement of Selmer sopranos.

 

I notice that Vandoren&#39;s facing lengths are the actual calculated 
length, as if measured with a 0 thickness feeler.  It is longer than the 
.0015" measurement.  Perhaps Selmer does this, too.

 

So, I think we are both on the same page, Ed.

 

Though Selmers measure 16mm, I feel 17mm-18mm is better facing length 
for soprano.
