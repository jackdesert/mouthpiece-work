            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
I made the mistake of registering the other night
(LATE at night!) and used a &#39;user name&#39; instead of my
own. After receiveing your email, I went back to try
and correct it, but I&#39;m unable to even login. Should I
reregister completely (new password, etc) or is there
a way to replace the user name? Take care. Peace.
