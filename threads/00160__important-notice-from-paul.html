            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Sax On The Web friends, and others...

Harri, webmaster at Sax On The Web, has informed me that someone has
sent out viruses using my address, but originating from AOL.

If any of you have received anything like this you think is from me,
please let me know.  I update my virus program daily, and have not had
any problems.  In fact, I just did a scan this afternoon with the latest
virus definitions, and my machine appears to be clean.

Any technical help in how to track down this person would also be
appreciated.

Paul
