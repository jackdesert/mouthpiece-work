            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve just uploaded some photos of a modern Link that I have just 
finished a total reface including a huge amount of baffle and interior 
smoothing.  It was brush plated with silver then gold.  The secret is 
to get as high a finish as possible before you start the plating. The 
results can be spectacular.
cheers
