            <pre class='message__body'>Last summer I got an old (@1948?) metal Link in a trade.  Now it  has 
become my favorite and I use it for everything.  It is pretty much down  to bare 
brass (a few touches of silver remain here and there).  
 
My question for the group is:  Since I don&#39;t want to wear out the  facing 
or tip or anything else, should I have the piece plated?  If so,  with what?  
Just silver?  Also gold?
 
Will plating alter the dimensions (internally or externally) in a negative  
way?
 
I want to do my best to preserve this old treasure--and I don&#39;t want  ruin 
it.
 
Thanks for the advice,

            <pre class='message__body'>I wouldn&#39;t call them a problem, rather, a characteristic to embrace or not.  Whereas Morgan discussed making his mouthpiece beak thin to maximize wall vibrations, I, preferring a solid, stable feel, opted to eliminate them as much as possible.  The results of both are perfectly satisfactory.  I&#39;m inclined to think that I won&#39;t feel the need to add more weight (blobs of mass) on the neck to influence the sound.  Its nice the way it is.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks.  Yes.  Snug but not too much so.  The idea is to have it shoved all the way in and to forget about it, i.e., the inner and outer lengths are optimized for a particular horn.  In the event it becomes tight or stuck, wrapping thick rubber (vacuum cleaner belt) around the knob on the end of the shank and gripping with normal pliers breaks it free easily, without marring the finish at all.
