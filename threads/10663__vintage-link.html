            <pre class='message__body'>Last summer I got an old (@1948?) metal Link in a trade.  Now it  has 
become my favorite and I use it for everything.  It is pretty much down  to bare 
brass (a few touches of silver remain here and there).  
 
My question for the group is:  Since I don&#39;t want to wear out the  facing 
or tip or anything else, should I have the piece plated?  If so,  with what?  
Just silver?  Also gold?
 
Will plating alter the dimensions (internally or externally) in a negative  
way?
 
I want to do my best to preserve this old treasure--and I don&#39;t want  ruin 
it.
 
Thanks for the advice,

I have sent mouthpieces for plating to him and they came back with the
exact facing specifications I sent them with.

Squeeze chambers have some acoustical advantages over Link chambers.  I&#39;ll be going into those specifics on my website for anyone interested.

The shank design looks pretty clever.  Snug fit like a flute head joint?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks.  Yes.  Snug but not too much so.  The idea is to have it shoved all the way in and to forget about it, i.e., the inner and outer lengths are optimized for a particular horn.  In the event it becomes tight or stuck, wrapping thick rubber (vacuum cleaner belt) around the knob on the end of the shank and gripping with normal pliers breaks it free easily, without marring the finish at all.

 A thin walled MPC vibrates in sympathy outside the mouth. Whether this is good or bad is open to debate.
I have a much relayed old rubber Larsen which is like this and needs a rubber patch to stifle teeth vibration.  Eddie
