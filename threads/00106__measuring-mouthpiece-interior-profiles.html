            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been working on adapting an old Pantograph to draw the inside 
profile of mouthpieces on a sheet of paper.  Its kind of rickety so 
far.  I made a 3/16" dia metal U-shaped probe to reach inside the 
MP.  I&#39;m trying to keep the probe tip in line with the original 
Pantograph tracing point.  I also need a better mouthpiece clamping 
fixture.

Something like this can work, I just need to get the bugs out.

I think a better method would be some kind of probe that can be 
inserted horizontally at, say, 1 mm intervals and a vertical 
measurement made.  This would generate X,Y coodinates that could be 
computer plotted to make a profile drawing.  More tedious, but I 
think better.

I&#39;ve seen high cost machines that can do this.  Large machine shops 
have 3D digitizers.

Anyone else have ideas on how to do this inexpensively?  I&#39;d like to 
make records of some shapes before a sell off more of my mouthpiece 
pile.
