            <pre class='message__body'>If any of you paid by credit card you can invoke any number of Federal Regulations with your credit card issuer to receive a FULL (and complete) refund.  It&#39;s called a chargeback - happens every day.  First you have to call your credit card issuer and give a verbal complaint. Then you will need to immediately follow-up with a written complaint on a special form which is provided by the credit card issuer.

Even if much time has passed (lets just say for this discussion - less than 6 months) you can still get a refund via the chargeback route.

If you paid other than by credit card, make sure you use one next time - and just give Theo some time.  We&#39;ve done much business with Theo, mostly wholesale with a sprinkle of retail, and have been very pleased with Theo.  His heart has always been in the right place and we&#39;ve always had our $$$ matters squared away.

SO - take action or be patient as the case may be & best of luck with your "mouth-peeces".

sincerely,

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: Theo Wanne owes me money



  In a short follow-up to my last post regarding Theo...

  I have recently done some work for a guy in Washington D.C.   The 
  poor fellow dropped his horn and broke the tip off his favorite NY 
  Meyer...  I bonded the pieces back together, and refinished his 
  piece and all is well in that regard.

  However, my customer asked me if I knew anything about Theo???  I 
  told him how Theo still owes me $715 for the two mouthpieces...

    Well this poor guy ordered $1500 worth of soprano mouthpieces 
  (attempting to try a bunch to find ONE that he liked).  Got them, 
  tried them all and then sent them all back - for a refund.  Never 
  got his money back.  He tried to get it taken care of, and then to 
  his dismay - the Mouthpiece Heaven site goes down.

  He&#39;s upset as I am.

     Man...  I would love to give Theo the benefit of the doubt, but 
  the man owes me over $700+ and now I find a new story... there are 
  no-doubt more out there.

  (That I know of) Collectively he owes his customers in excess of 
  $2000
     
  Are there more people out there?

         What&#39;s Up Theo???  -- You have chance to make these wrongs - 
  right.
