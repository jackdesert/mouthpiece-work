            <pre class='message__body'>I saw that this was talked about in the past, but there didn&#39;t seem to be a real resolution of how to do it.  I have a couple Brilhart Ebolins that have tooth wear marks.  One is completely through the white overlay and into the black.  The dental repair kits that I&#39;ve seen imply that the repair is temporary until you can get to the dentist (Dentemp filling glue and Temparin at about $6).  Dental epoxy starts at about $75.  More exotic dental epoxies are $125-150.  

Has anybody had experience and, hopefully, success with the over-the-counter white fixit kits?  If not, I&#39;m tempted to take the mp with me to the dentist next time.  He always asks if I brought my night guard to be cleaned by the hygenist while he&#39;s doing the exam.  Maybe I could say "No, but how &#39;bout having her do a little filing right here?"
