            <pre class='message__body'>I have just bought an 1964 SDA  Buffet Crapon TENOR
Mouthpiece was not included.

Any recommendations regarding the  Type, material, opening?
I am still a newbie (1.5 Yrs player).
I like the Stan Getz sound, Coltrane also (among many others) - soft
and rich , not so edgy.
Main types available in Israel are: Meyer, Otto-link, Vandorn, Berg,
Yamaha, Yanagisawa - may be others - but the selection is limited, so
general directions will help me more.

All the best.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you have only been playing for 1.5 years, i would recommend you get 
something with a moderate chamber and a moderate opening.  i would look for 
a rubber meyer/link in a 5 or 6 facing but be careful as they can be 
inconsistant.  you might also look at the new selmer soloist, its not quite 
like the old soloist but in a E or F facing it can be a decent mouthpiece, 
and I find the chamber works better for me than a link a meyer.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Vintage NY Meyer BROS that that seems to work very well for 
many applications. OR.... TRY a Sumner HR piece.

            <pre class='message__body'>For a beginner I would suggest a Vandoren V16 for tenor players 
maybe the T75 facing. Easy to play. You&#39;ll like it very much.

And they are well made.

            <pre class='message__body'>Since you have only been playing 1 1/2 years, let me suggest a 
mouthpiece, for general playing, that I have fitted for literally 
thousands of students at trade shows, clinics, etc.  The Runyon Custom 
Spoiler.  For you, I would suggest the #6 facing.

This mouthpiece is

Moderately priced

The #6 facing is not too large, but large enough to get a good, full 
tone without requiring "iron jaws" to play.

The tone, with the "spoiler" insert removed is nearly dark enough for 
concert band, well suited to 1940&#39;s "Big Band" playing, or general combo 
jazz playing.

With the spoiler insert the tone is brighter, bolder, projects better.  
So, essentially you have two mouthpieces in one.  At first I would 
advise not using the Spoiler (r) insert until you have more experience.

This mouthpiece gives good intonation on most saxes.

As I said, I have had literally thousands use the mouthpiece for their 
first jazz mouthpiece with good results.

Woodwind & Brasswind carries this model, and I have shipped to Israel, too.
