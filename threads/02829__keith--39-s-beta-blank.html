            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,
Thanks for sharing your two finishing details!  I&#39;ll voice the question 
I am sure everyone is thinking..... "SO, HOW DO THEY PLAY??!" and which 
would you advise a "follower" to emulate? JimG

            <pre class='message__body'>They play well, but are both a brighter than what I am currently playing on
(a Ponzol M1).  For a brighter sound, I still prefer my tricked-out Delrin
Quantum.  But if I were still playing bar jobs, I would give these a try.
