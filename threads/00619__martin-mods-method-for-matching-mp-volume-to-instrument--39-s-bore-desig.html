            <pre class='message__body'>Ok Lance.  I would like to hear in detail your system for determining the correct mp volume for a given instrument&#39;s bore taper in order to produce good intonation in all octaves and registers.

Since the information has been obfuscated and sidetracked in other threads by arguments, I have never been able to clearly understand the technique from start to finish.  

This is your opportunity to present your case.  Please do so as clearly and succinctly as you are able.  I may ask a few questions at the end, but will not interrupt the flow of information with "cross talk" and argument.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for that invitation, John.  I am currently in the process of publishing a detailed guide/explanation for this method, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll understand if I refrain from spilling all the beans here and now.  I will touch on some interesting issues however, for the sake of conversation.  

First, some clarification.   The wording of your request implies that mouthpiece volume is the only important parameter to consider in matching a mouthpiece.  Volume is of course, only one of the two important parameters that need to be dealt with, the other being the mouthpiece cavity&#39;s own resonant frequency as it is positioned on the neck.  Being aware of these two parameter is still only half the story.  One must understand how they interact and affect one another.  The matched mouthpiece provides the optimal value of both simultaneously, at the individual player&#39;s normal embouchure "point of equilibrium", ie., where the player is most comfortable while playing.  

Secondly, you imply that a mouthpiece can be adjusted to provide "good intonation in all octaves and registers", regardless of bore taper.  This is certainly not the case as there are limits.  Some bore shapes are simply musically useless.  What is important to remember, is that the mouthpiece completes the instrument&#39;s design and it is senseless to attempt to evaluate/modify the instrument, without first having a thorough understanding of what the mouthpiece is doing.  In my experience with good vintage instruments however, the intonation problems commonly believed to be characteristic of the instrument (sharp E2/F2, flat C/C#, throw-away C#, flat D1 , flat palm keys, sharp palm keys, etc.) are just the result of a good instrument being crippled by the available mouthpieces completing the design inadequately.

The key to understanding how all this can be, and how to take advantage of it, is in the realization that, despite what is commonly believed and taught,  a saxophone&#39;s conical air column does not behave as an open cylinder, i.e. 1 cycle = 2 x tube length transits.  The cycle of a complete cone does, but the saxophone is truncated, with a quasi-cylindrical mouthpiece that completes the design, and as such, behaves as a closed cylinder, 1 cycle = 4x tube length transits, BUT, the cycle is interrupted in the first part of the 3rd length transit by the pressure wave of the mouthpiece cavity resonance, returning to the reed, which initiates a new cycle.  The saxophone cycle then consists of reed to open hole, to reed, to end of mouthpiece resonance (determined by neck taper), to reed transits.  Rockaboy described this as has Nederveen, and Dalmont.  Even Ferron mentions it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lance,

I was actually hoping for a set of instructions I could try myself.  You have repeatedly challenged me on other forums to begin by setting the mouthpiece on the neck to where the D1 - D2 relationship is a perfect octave regardless of the tuning.  I was interested in what comes after that in order to test your theory.

I have no desire in hashing through all the theoretical background here.  I tried reading the "Spread Octaves" thread on SOTW to try to glean some information and my eyes glazed over by the second page.
