Of course you are logically correct in this - as the old saying goes-
A place for everything and everything in it&#39;s place.

Only wish I could follow it myself....

I do have just one nagging feeling - that when I have visited /seen the workplaces of some of our countries very finest repairers their benches usually look like a tip.

I&#39;m not advocating this - just observing!!
