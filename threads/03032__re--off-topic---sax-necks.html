            <pre class='message__body'>If your current neck has been damaged and reworked several times, it 
might not be worth working on.  The neck is the most critical part of 
the horn.  It affects EVERYTHING below it, to the better or worst.  A 
little bulge here, a dent there, all can adversely affect the horn.

I have a great Mk VI with a very good undamaged neck.  I thought for 
sure that is as good as it gets.  Then I tried one of the Silver necks 
currently available from Selmer.  It was good, but no better than what I 
had already.

But then I was arm-twisted into playing one of the Unison Masterpiece 
necks designed by Steve Goodson.  I really went into that as a skeptic.  
I changed my mind immediately.  It was like going from a mediocre 
mouthpiece to a really good mouthpiece.  Totally different horn, and 
improved in all ways... response, particularly the low end, evenness of 
scale, tone, all of it.  That is what I use on my Mk VI now.

But I don&#39;t know if these are available anymore.  Goodson is working on 
some new necks for VI&#39;s now which should be even more advanced over the 
Masterpiece.

necks for Selmer horns, which we make in our shop. I&#39;ll be happy to provide
information to anyone who emails me privately, as it&#39;s OT for this group.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have two 10M saxes.  One had a lot of neck dents taken out.  Decent job
but you could see ripples.  The undamaged neck plays significantly better
on both saxes.

On my YAS-62 I tried a stripped then silver plated neck.  Looked cool but
played identical to the original neck.  I also tried a Ponzol neck. 
Significant difference in intonation that I did not want to adjust to.  I&#39;m
playing on the original neck.

So necks can make a difference.  But in my case, the originals are the
best.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would be willing to try other necks rather than repair this one but I would want to A/B the necks live. Any ideas who in the NYC/NJ/PA who might have a selection of selmer necks?
