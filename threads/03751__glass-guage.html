            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

I was wondering if I could get in on this group buy for the glass 
gauges?

I would like a wide setback (metric) type.


I wanted to add that I appreciate that you would be willing to take 
this on.   I&#39;ve been scouring the web trying to find anyone that 
lists these gauges as available and haven&#39;t had much luck.   It even 
seems like the Morgan and Winslow kits are hard to find.


Thanks,
Dwayne Irvin
