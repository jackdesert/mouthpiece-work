I have found out that I&#39;m in tune with the metronome at A440 but my

about a whole half step down from the normal tuning.

I want to know if the horn is defective or is there some way I can play

I want to know if the horn is defective or is there some way I can play some

The saxophone is a transposing instrument in the key of Bb (or Eb for altos and baris).  That means that when the saxophone plays a C, it is the same as a Bb on the piano.  (or Eb for alto and bari).  

Mr. Goodson is correct, a metronome is for tempo and not tuning, but many metronomes today come with a tuning note built in (such as the Seiko metronome).  It&#39;s likely that&#39;s what Brother Jackson is referring to.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you are referring to a whole and a half step, and you are playing an
alto sax then there is no problem.  Since the saxophone is in the key of
Eb when you play your "C" it is the same as the concert  pitch of Eb
which is a step an a half away.  When you play the F# with the octave
key on your sax, it sounds the same as AD0 on the tuner.

Many tuners nowadays also have a metronome built in.   I hope this
helps.
