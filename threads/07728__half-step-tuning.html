            <pre class='message__body'>I want to ask you a personal question because I&#39;m embarassed to ask this 
question to the group.

I have found out that I&#39;m in tune with the metronome at A440 but my 
saxophone generally tunes
about a whole half step down from the normal tuning.

I want to know if the horn is defective or is there some way I can play 
some notes for you to
analyze.  I have never heard of this much of a tuning problem with a 
saxophone before.

Will/can you please help me with this?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m confused. Can you tune to A = 440 or not? It sounds like you can, but then do you mean that the rest of the notes, or some of the notes are a semitone low?

Can you give us a bit better description of what is in tune and what isn&#39;t?

I want to ask you a personal question because I&#39;m embarassed to ask this
question to the group. 

I have found out that I&#39;m in tune with the metronome at A440 but my
saxophone generally tunes 
about a whole half step down from the normal tuning. 

I want to know if the horn is defective or is there some way I can play some
notes for you to 
analyze.  I have never heard of this much of a tuning problem with a
saxophone before. 

Will/can you please help me with this?

            <pre class='message__body'>If you are playing a tenor or soprano saxophone, your "A" will not be the same as A 440.  Your "A" is actually a "G".  Tune to your note "B", that is the same as A 440.  

The saxophone is a transposing instrument in the key of Bb (or Eb for altos and baris).  That means that when the saxophone plays a C, it is the same as a Bb on the piano.  (or Eb for alto and bari).  

Mr. Goodson is correct, a metronome is for tempo and not tuning, but many metronomes today come with a tuning note built in (such as the Seiko metronome).  It&#39;s likely that&#39;s what Brother Jackson is referring to.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you are referring to a whole and a half step, and you are playing an
alto sax then there is no problem.  Since the saxophone is in the key of
Eb when you play your "C" it is the same as the concert  pitch of Eb
which is a step an a half away.  When you play the F# with the octave
key on your sax, it sounds the same as AD0 on the tuner.

Many tuners nowadays also have a metronome built in.   I hope this
helps.
