            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m new.  But it&#39;s an old subject.  Quickly, I&#39;m a retired oboist.  
Playing the saxes and tired of spending fortunes for mpcs.  I just 
want to be able to help myself fix a mpc so it works for my 
embouchure.

Motivated by my total inability to get my beautiful Yani soprano to 
play easily past a high "D"...or even not so so easily...just play!

Have corresponded with the always great and helpful Paul C.  he 
turned me on to the Runyon stuff, and the Winslow stuff.  I am 
looking for the particular pieces in the kits.  I haven&#39;t got 
hundreds of bucks to spend on stuff I&#39;ll not use.

Can anyone tell me where to get the Winslow glass gauge?  And the 
Micrometer pressure indicator in the same kit?  I don&#39;t need to buy 
mpcs, as I have a whole drawer to fool around with.  I can get the 
feeler gauges at a car supply, etc......

So, help, and thanks,

Fred

            <pre class='message__body'>Welcome!  Look on the MouthpieceWorks site in the Files area.  There are
lists of suggested equipment and sources where you can get it.  The glass
gage you asked about is easy to get from Babbitt for about $15.  I think
Babbitt may have wand tip gages too.  I like to use digital calipers to
measure tips.  Plus, they can be used to measure other parts of the
mouthpiece and can be used to verify what your feeler gage thicknesses
really are.  MicroMark has some econimical calipers.

Look through the early posts in the archive.  We talked a lot about
equipment when the group was first started.  Later, one of our members
compiled all the info into the lists in the Files section.
