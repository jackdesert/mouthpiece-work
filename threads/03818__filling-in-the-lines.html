Years ago I used to work at a ski shop where we did engraving on skis and 
bowling balls. We filled the engarving in by rubbing over the top of it with 
a sort of waxy crayon then just rubbed the excess off with a rag. I&#39;m not 
sure if .005 is deep enough to hold material like this but it might be 
easier then trying to paint them.

We use the same technique you describe to highlight trademarks on clarinets
and to add color to engraved saxophones. I am not sure that .005 is deep
enough to hold the material.
