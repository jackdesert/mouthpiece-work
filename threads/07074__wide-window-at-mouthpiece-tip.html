>Thanks. I mean the widest at the tip. From any manufacturer. Who is making the most of standard reed width at the tip. I know I have to trim reeds down on many.

If you are looking for the most rail overhang, that would be a Sugal.  If you want a wide window at the tip with no overhang, one of the thin side rail mouthpieces would be it.  Like one of the Guardala LTs, a Jody Jazz DV, Brancher, SR Tech...  all are CNC MPs.
