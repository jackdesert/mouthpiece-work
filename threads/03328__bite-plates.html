Yes, I realize this. But it seems to me it would be far easier to craft one 
for any mouthpiece out of a 1 inch square by 1/8 inch thick blank then to 
hack & grind at an old clarinet mouthpiece or use an epoxy that may or may 
not be safe.

  I&#39;m surprised it would be so expensive just to get little plastic chips - 
I mean, half the stuff in the world is made out of some form of plastic.

Whadda I know,

12"x12" sheets of acrylics in .060-.080" thicknes can be purchased for $2-4
from McMaster-Carr.  1/16 x 1" wide white Delrin for $.62/ft.

I have not tried these.  I&#39;m into casting and shaping acrylics instead of
shaping and gluing solid pieces.

For example, a die and core set for a mouthpiece is more than $50,000.

Thanks Mojo, this is more what I had in mind. (Though something a little 
thicker so you&#39;d just be dealing with a single piece would be nice.) It 
seems like this would be easier and less work then trying to cast them in 
place or otherwise fabricate one out of an old mouthpiece. However, I 
haven&#39;t attempted either method so I&#39;ll yield to those with greater 
experience.

My original point was that this discussion seems to come up about once a 
month; with so much stuff being made of plastic and many of the bite plates 
being similar in size - if one had a blank to work with, it wouldn&#39;t be too 
hard a process to sand it down into shape.
