The facing curve struck me as being very nice... for an alto mouthpiece!.  It has a .060" tip and a 40 facing length.  Has a medium elliptical facing curve with a major/minor ratio of 3.6 by my curve fitting.  It was very even left to right.

I guess a lot of kids are learning on these.

Any thoughts about the actual tip radius out there...?
What would you expect the change to be, between a flatter radius and one that was a bit rounder.

I&#39;ve been experimenting with the reed radius and the roundness at the tip corners, thinking that less weight would be better, but results seem to be pointing in the other direction.

Any ideas?

            <pre class='message__body'>I was thinking the tip radius from side to side... The width of the reed, as well as the rads. on each corner of the tip.
The changes I tried were small, and simply varied "where" on the rails, the reed actually landed.
Increasing the roundness of those areas didn&#39;t produce the results I was expecting.

The "effectively lengthening the tip rail" suggestion sounds logical though. Something else to think about.

      I do not understand the original question.  Are you asking about the same of the tip rail as compared to the reed tip?  Or, the facing cuve at the tip or the baffle at the tip?  Or what?

            <pre class='message__body'>Widening the tip end of the reed channel increases the air flow into the mouthpiece and increases the reed surface that mouthpiece pressure can act on.

Changing a straight-across tip rail/reed tip profile to a rounded tip rail/reed tip profile just increases the tip rail length and the amount of reed surface in the tip area.  It wouldn&#39;t increase input air flow as long as the channel remained the same width.

I&#39;m inclined to think that the amount of radius on the corners is significantly less important and noticeable than having the optimal baffle shape/height directly under the reed in those corners, whatever radius is used.

      I was thinking the tip radius from side to side... The width of the reed, as well as the rads. on each corner of the tip.

The changes I tried were small, and simply varied "where" on the rails, the reed actually landed.

Increasing the roundness of those areas didn&#39;t produce the results I was expecting.



The "effectively lengthening the tip rail" suggestion sounds logical though. Something else to think about.

I do not understand the original question.  Are you asking about the same of the tip rail as compared to the reed tip?  Or, the facing cuve at the tip or the baffle at the tip?  Or what?

      I think a rounder radius means more thin tip means softer. Not a question of weight, but of mechanical stiffness and the gradient of mechanical stiffness.

Interesting question. There must be a point with decreasing radius where things start to get weird. Also, I wonder about Bernoulli forces when the direction of air flow gets farther and farther from perpendicular to the reed tip edge.

            <pre class='message__body'>Overhanging the reed--or a thick tip rail is something like clipping the tip--the reed can only respond from the point where it touches the back edge of the tip rail, because that is where the forces are generated that cause and govern the closing cycle.

France to the left of the table and 3* to the right. If it had the Brilhart
trademark on top with hard rubber below it would be worth much more. Does
anyone know the origin of these blanks? My guess is Riffault. @yahoogroups.com
