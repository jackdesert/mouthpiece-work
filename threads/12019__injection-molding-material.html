            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,
 

 I know there is a lot of proprietary knowledge out there, so I won't ask for someone's secret ingredients... but could someone please recommend a starting material for injection molding mouthpieces?  I've read that 82+ shore D is the minimum recommended hardness.  
 

 There also seems to be some reluctance on the part of injection companies to produce something that is not "food safe".  Is "food safe" applicable for mouthpieces?  Isn't it a similar risk as a water bottle, or straw?
 

 Thank you,
 

 -Bill

            <pre class='message__body'>As the mouthpiece will spend the important part of its working life in 
your mouth then I&#39;d say yes, it is important.
