            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all

I&#39;m new to the group and to refacing mouthpieces. 

I thinking of getting some bakelite mouthpieces from China through ebay as a way of getting some hands on practice. They sell for around $5 each.

I&#39;d be grateful for any opinions on this proposal.

Thanks

Robert

            <pre class='message__body'>I did that (I think is was 5 tenor, 2 alto and 5 soprano).  2-3 of the tenor mouthpieces are now played by profesional saxophonists. Two of them I custom made for a jazz player who put away his JodyJazz NY tenor 7* for this mpc - made from a $5 China piece... 
He had special requests, and we worked our way until till he was satisfied. It was a very educational and fun process.

They call it bakelit, which I guess is a form of plastic? It was not as easy to work on as i believed. But the result was pretty good. If it is more durable than other forms of plastic I do not know.

            <pre class='message__body'>several years ago, I bought a couple of hundred mouthpieces in China  
that were represented to me as bakelite.....they cost next to nothing,  
so I wasn&#39;t worried.....they were in fact polystyrene

Bakelite was one of the first plastics I think. If you&#39;re old enough to remember the old black telephones, they were bakelite.

            <pre class='message__body'> Bakelite was one of the  thermo- setting  plastics.  Once set the material was permanent and if you tried to heat it again it would not melt but burn instead.  We now use  thermo-plastic plastics instead, which melt again when reheated.  Are there still any thermo-setting plastics around for certain applications?  There probably were many different types of Bakelite material with different properties for various applications. Not all were brittle and prone to breaking when dropped. Some probably had good acoustical properties. </pre>
