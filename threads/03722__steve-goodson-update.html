            <pre class='message__body'>I just spoke with Steve about an hour ago.  He can&#39;t always get to the 
computer to post, so he asked me to just give a quick update.

He is still in Alabama but plans to head back to NOLA Wednesday as he 
mentioned - depending on the condition of Sharon&#39;s Mother.  Much of 
their time has been spent dealing with Insurance, FEMA and all the red 
tape that goes with this situation.  Fortunately, Sharon has 
experience in this area and they both know how to get things 
accomplished.

He seemed to be in good spirits and has many plans in place to rebuild 
his home and his business as quickly as possible.  He and Sharon have 
many friends and connections helping them out (some, I&#39;m sure, are 
posters here).  He definately is anxious to get home and plans to "hit 
the ground running".  He also seems anxious to get back in business 
and help his friends and clients who were affected by Katrina.

I would imagine he will be posting his own update once he gets back to 
NOLA.
