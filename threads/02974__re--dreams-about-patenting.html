            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Dmitri - Have you actually "invented-developed" something of use  re: mps 
?  If so, I&#39;d suggest not publicizing it widely, before you  write-up a 
"Disclosure of Invention" with your signature and "invention" date,  and have 
someone [knowledgable] sign/date it as "Read and Understood By" , for  your 
"ownership" protection [in the US, if you live in another  country, other patenting 
laws may apply] . Then develop it, engage a patent  attorney, file an 
application for patent, then "sell" it as best you can.   Luck, Don

Thanks Don. 
This way is new for me. I&#39;ve got also really informative e-mail with 
other mature answers to my questions. Also I&#39;ve read a lot and do not 
have more question.
   As this fixture can not be serious commercial product I&#39;ll try 
patenting it here, in Canada because patenting here is cheap ( 500 
CAD for primary fees), for my self satisfaction.
I hope it would make possible patenting attempts in other countries 
invalid as &#39;no novelty&#39; presents. I will stick to the plan if my wife 
will not kill me on a half way. 
Sorry for bringing patenting issues in this group but I checked: many 
patenting related groups are filled with Perpetum Motion enthusiasts 
and lawyer&#39;s adds. Official regulations are the main source of the 
information.

The fixture is on a concept stage now and going to be expensive.
Mouthpiece makers may be interested. I&#39;ll post any worthy results if 
they appear.

Dmitri
