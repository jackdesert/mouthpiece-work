            <pre class='message__body'>Anybody know of a source of relatively inexpensive metal blanks? I&#39;ve 
just about gone through all my Babbit HR blanks and Ricos and I&#39;d 
like to work on more metal pieces.

There&#39;s a shop in my area that sells cheap Asian instruments and has 
some gold plated mouthpieces on Ebay. I called him and he says they 
are "Gold Star" brand pieces made in Taiwan. Anybody heard of these? 
At $38, they aren&#39;t a bargin, but if the material is good I would 
mind buying a couple for rework.

            <pre class='message__body'>$38 does not sound too bad for metal blank.  But I have not tried
suppliers.  Runyon may sell you some unplated unfaced blanks.  Phil Barone
has listed some on eBay in the past.

You can just bottom surf eBay for damaged metal pieces.
