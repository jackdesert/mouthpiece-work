            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Guys, 
 I've got some new glass gauges for sale. Been working on this for a couple of years and I'm finally happy with the results so I've got them for sale. Â£25 each, I've uploaded a couple of images in the photos section.
 

 cheers
 Morgan

            <pre class='message__body'>I'm very interested in this glass gauge.  

 I know your internet site(https://morganfrymouthpieces.com)
 

 Is it right? But I can't find glass gauge in that site.
 

 How can I purchase it?
 

 I live in seoul in south korea.
 

 My email is fodera.mg5@gmail.com
 

 I'm using theo wanne gauge. But it is very weak in scratch.
 

 so i can't see the scale easily when I use it.
 

 Is it strong in scratches?

            <pre class='message__body'>No, I don't have it on the website yet. I'll get some proper photos taken and get it up there eventually but probably not until summer or autumn of this year. It's not a very profitable item for me so selling volume is a low priority. Email me at morgan@morganfrymouthpieces.com and I'll send you an invoice. 

 As to scratches, it's a little more scratch resistant than regular float glass, but scratching is still how it's going to reach the end of it's useful life. Do enough mouthpieces and it'll die from scratches like all the rest.
