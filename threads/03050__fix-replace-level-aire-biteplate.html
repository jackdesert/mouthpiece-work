            <pre class='message__body'>Greetings,

I&#39;m not sure that I will actually attempt any of this myself, but
figured I would ask anyway.

I&#39;ve got a tenor Level Aire mouthpiece that needs some work.  I&#39;m not
sure about its exact vintage but I&#39;m fairly certain it was made by
Brilhart. (s/n 14362)

I thought I remembered reading that replacement biteplates were
available somewhere.  Anyone know more about this?  Along these lines,
how do I remove the old biteplate without damging the rest of the
mouthpiece?

I&#39;ve also heard of taking a chunk out of an alto mouthpiece and
machining it down to the size and shape of a biteplate.  I&#39;m not sure I
have the skills or equipment that would allow me to do this.

Given all the discussion about certain plastics, epoxies, etc. possibly
being toxic, what else can I do to fix deep gouges in a Level Aire
biteplate?  I was thinking I could avoid the issue by using some kind of
natural material.  All I can think of at the moment is beeswax and
obviously I would just chew right through it.  (And as for adhesive
biteplate patches, what is the adhesive made out of?)

(The SOTW forum just came back up so I will dig around for answers
there, as well.)

Thanx in advance,

--Joe C.

            <pre class='message__body'>Joe, if it were me... I would put a drop or two of 5 min epoxy in the 
teeth grooves, file and sand smooth, polish, and put a clear patch over it.

I don&#39;t know of any source of biteplates.

            <pre class='message__body'>Most manufacturers and repairers use thick, or gel type CA glue to glue 
bite plates.

            <pre class='message__body'>Theo lists LA biteplates for sale on his site.  Its buried in his rates for
services.

I would fill the depression with a 2-part acrylic.
