            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all...
I know this issue has been discussed before here but not to a final 
end... 
I am wondering how to secure a mouthpiece to the lathe using only one 
side (ie no live end)as the beak end of the piece is not centered.
I imagine there is a thing like a expanding arbor or mandrel( although 
a mandrel goes all the way thru the work) that would be used for this.
Interior chucks just look too shallow and I am afraid the work will 
just fly off when force is applied.
Thanks in advance.
Patrick

            <pre class='message__body'>I think it is better to have a jig made that envelops the beak end of 
your casting at least halfway so you may be able to work on the body of 
the mouthpiece firmly and securely in place.

            <pre class='message__body'>Patrick,
   
  Check out "the saxophone is my voice" by Ernest Ferron..he has a schematic for just exactly that thing.
