            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all...
I know this issue has been discussed before here but not to a final 
end... 
I am wondering how to secure a mouthpiece to the lathe using only one 
side (ie no live end)as the beak end of the piece is not centered.
I imagine there is a thing like a expanding arbor or mandrel( although 
a mandrel goes all the way thru the work) that would be used for this.
Interior chucks just look too shallow and I am afraid the work will 
just fly off when force is applied.
Thanks in advance.
Patrick
