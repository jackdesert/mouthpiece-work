            <pre class='message__body'>A quick couple of questions - 

If you want to make the window uniform on both sides, but one side is different than the other, then what&#39;s the best way to go about doing this in terms of tools and/or technique? When this problem has arisen for me, I&#39;ve tried to just even out with window shape with files, (this usually also means some table undercutting after that to get the area under the table evened out again too). However, I&#39;ve found it to be pretty difficult to get the window shape to be uniform just using my small needle files and a 4" regular half round file, and much more so with metal mouthpieces than hard rubber. Do you guys have any suggestions for this? 

Also, does anyone here use their flex shaft to shape the window and/or the thicker part of the side rails near the window? I don&#39;t have one, but am guessing that the spinning bit might cut pretty jaggedly, which is why I&#39;d also guess that this wouldn&#39;t work. However, just thought I&#39;d ask.

Thanks guys.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sounds like you could use some riffler files.  These are bent curved files.  I 
have a couple of sets from Micro-Mark.  Once set is fairly coarse and the other 
is fine.  I could not find any in-between years ago when I was looking for 
them.   Not all sizes in the set are useful.  I just use 3 of the coarser ones.  
The files are shown in some of the rework photos on my site.  


I may try some Valtitan (hard metal) "0" cuts.  I prefer "00" cuts. Also these 
look a bit long. Shapes 611, 663, and 681 look useful.

A rotary tool set-up is useful if you end up doing a lot of mouthpiece work.  
They do not leave a jagged surface but they can leave grooves and craters if you 
leave the tool in one spot too long.  Since they remove material fast, they can 
do a lot of damage fast.  They can also jump on you due to the rotary motion.  
Like a wheel falling off a car at high speed.  But no guts, no glory.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Window shaping technique/side rail cutting question

  
A quick couple of questions - 

If you want to make the window uniform on both sides, but one side is different 
than the other, then what&#39;s the best way to go about doing this in terms of 
tools and/or technique? When this problem has arisen for me, I&#39;ve tried to just 
even out with window shape with files, (this usually also means some table 
undercutting after that to get the area under the table evened out again too). 
However, I&#39;ve found it to be pretty difficult to get the window shape to be 
uniform just using my small needle files and a 4" regular half round file, and 
much more so with metal mouthpieces than hard rubber. Do you guys have any 
suggestions for this? 


Also, does anyone here use their flex shaft to shape the window and/or the 
thicker part of the side rails near the window? I don&#39;t have one, but am 
guessing that the spinning bit might cut pretty jaggedly, which is why I&#39;d also 
guess that this wouldn&#39;t work. However, just thought I&#39;d ask.

Thanks guys.

Yes, it seems that the Valtitan "00" works a lot better especially on metal pieces. Strange that "00" doesn&#39;t seem to be available as a riffler file cut option. 
I&#39;ll look for those coarse and fine cut rifflers on the micromark site. Thanks for the tips.

I keep Dremel (or other) power tools well away from mouthpieces.  There is no way to control it by hand, and it will walk across other areas and tear up a lot of mouthpiece in a fraction of a second.  Then you get to call your customer and say, "Ooops!  Sorry, man."

Just wanted to make sure to get the right ones since I don&#39;t know exactly what to look for. I&#39;d try the Valtitans, but wish they came in "00" instead of just "0".

I was just wondering if you&#39;d gotten those Valtitan riffler files in the "0" cut yet that you&#39;d mentioned, and if so, how you think they compare to the Micromark "coarse" set. I found a set of riffler "rasp" type files the other day in a woodworking shop that I passed by, but didn&#39;t get them because the file teeth on them were more like "spikes" compared to the more regular type of file teeth that you&#39;d find on needle files.

I do now have 3 Valtitan riffler files in the "0" cut.  They are about 2X
large to use for most mouthpiece work.  They wont fit inside a most sop sax
MP chambers and barely fit in an alto.  I think I will occasionally use them
to do some baffle work, but they are too large for side wall shaping.  The
"0" cut does not look too bad. 

 

The Micro-Mark coarse riffler files I have sound similar to the "spikes" you

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Mojo,

Thanks so much for the info - interesting and very helpful too. I didn&#39;t realize that those spiked rifflers would be ok, that&#39;s good to hear as I&#39;d much rather buy locally anyway. The ones I saw looked very much like these: http://www.amazon.com/Steelex-D2862-Medium-Riffler-8-Piece/dp/B0000DD334/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1293416558&sr=8-1
I suppose that these would be helpful for roughing out the shape of the window, and then you could clean it up with some smoother files and sandpaper. It&#39;s just been too hard trying to get the whole window normal even looking with just a half-round file. Thanks again for the help.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Matt,

It was a short post, here it is again.

 

"I bought a set of no-name rifflers that were too wide for mouthpiece work,
but I carefully ground them on a wheel, taking care not to let them get hot.
They work just fine now."

 

I carefully thinned and narrowed them, leaving the working surface intact.
If they&#39;re double sided, you lose one surface, so you may need to buy a few
spares.

Regards,

Tony F.

Hi Mojo,

Thanks so much for the info - interesting and very helpful too. I didn&#39;t realize 
that those spiked rifflers would be ok, that&#39;s good to hear as I&#39;d much rather 
buy locally anyway. The ones I saw looked very much like these: 
http://www.amazon.com/Steelex-D2862-Medium-Riffler-8-Piece/dp/B0000DD334/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1293416558&sr=8-1

I suppose that these would be helpful for roughing out the shape of the window, 
and then you could clean it up with some smoother files and sandpaper. It&#39;s just 
been too hard trying to get the whole window normal even looking with just a 
half-round file. Thanks again for the help.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well, the riffler files I ordered earlier this month arrived this weekend, and I actually had a chance to use them on a job for someone this weekend. This particular mouthpiece had a window that was not nearly as long as the "U" shape of the reed vamp, so during the reface I lengthened the window "U" shape to match the length of the reed vamp "U" shape. This really seemed to make a pretty big difference in response, especially in the low end. One thing that happens is a big wall builds up under the table, but this just needs some extra undercutting and it&#39;s easily taken care of. After the mouthpiece was finished to about .061" and 38L (a 19mm facing length), I tried it out and it responded much better in the low end. Actually, I also tried it before finishing the reface, but after lengthening the window (just to see what difference the window lengthening made on its own), and this really did make quite a difference in response even before the curve work was done. 
So, I have a question about window lengthening - I did some searching and it has been said here that once the window gets long enough, extending it further doesn&#39;t make too much difference. However, I&#39;m wondering, what is a good target for window length? What I&#39;ve been doing is just matching the window "U" shape to the same length of the reed vamp "U" shape, as mentioned above. That does seem to help and often this is quite a bit of lengthening (takes a while to do it by hand with files!), but I guess I&#39;m just wondering if you should go even further a little past the reed vamp for best results, or how to determine the appropriate length for the window. I&#39;ve noticed that older mouthpieces a lot of times have longer windows than modern pieces.  
Thanks for your help! It&#39;s much appreciated.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks very much for your reply Matt, I really appreciate it and that sounds good. So, it sounds like that&#39;s a good target to shoot for - I guess the problem I was having before was that sometimes the windows on some blanks would be relatively short, much shorter than the reed vamp, and that does seem to make a negative difference. So cool, the reed vamp length sounds like a good window length target. 
Thanks for the info! Best,

Matt

However, I&#39;m wondering, what is a good target for window length? What I&#39;ve been doing is just matching the window "U" shape to the same length of the reed vamp "U" shape, as mentioned above. That does seem to help and often this is quite a bit of lengthening (takes a while to do it by hand with files!), but I guess I&#39;m just wondering if you should go even further a little past the reed vamp for best results, or how to determine the appropriate length for the window.

the Jody Jazz "2 window" pieces.  I hated the Rovner (glad they&#39;re gone)

decided to stay with my older "single" window Jody piece.  The great 
thing about running a repair/pro shop is that I get to try everything I 
stock.  Plus trying stuff at the shows.
