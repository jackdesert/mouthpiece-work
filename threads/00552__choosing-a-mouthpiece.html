I DISAGREE.  WW&BW Mouthpiece Return Policy (as stated on pages 50 and 
58 of The Woodwind Catalog, Fall-Winter 2002) says---

"Orders of up to 4 mouthpieces may be purchased in full or with a 25% 
down payment."  "There is a $3.50 cleaning and sterilization charge on 
all mouthpieces returned ($7.50 charge on mouthpieces over $300 
selling price)."  "Mouthpieces must be returned free of blemishes and 
in the original packaging."  "Late returns will be subject to a $10 
late fee per mouthpiece.
