Hi Keith
If you get closer to the subject than your camera will focus, it will always be blurry....
Close-up filters may help, (Inexpensive from a camera store)

Any camera movement during the exposure is  also damaging.....

Maximum light will also help to sharpen focus.....
Direct sunlight is one of the best....

At least with digital, you find out right away.

Keep trying....It&#39;s easier than facings....:)

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

2 Mpix is plenty for prints up to 8x10. One thing you have to consider is the minimum focus distance--different cameras have different minimum focusing distances in macro mode. The old standard used to be about 20 cm--about 8 inches. New cameras have macro modes down to 1 cm. Also the minimum distance is usually at full wide, so you can&#39;t get away with zooming in when you are in macro mode.

Try using flash or bright illumination if you are not, as this will give you better depth of field and higher shutter speed, but I suspect that you just might be too close. You can try holding a decent magnifying glass or convex lens over the prime lens which will act as a close-up lens--you&#39;ll need to check your focus on the LCD screen on the camera to get it exactly right. The stronger the lens the closer you can get--you can change the magnification by changing the zoom. This will degrade the sharpness marginally but not enough to make any real difference.

  Anyone have tips on how to take better close-ups of tip rail quality? 

  My camera is a 2 Meg Canon so it is old by today&#39;s standards.  It has a 
  close-up mode (tulip icon) but its still not clear enough for me.

2Mp is OK for 8x10&#39;s, but you&#39;re better to keep them to 5x7 at most.

As far as getting better closeups:

1. Tripod

2. Macro mode at the wide angle setting

3. Slow ISO setting

4. Sunlight OR cover the on camera flashtube with a double layer of 
20lb copy paper to diffuse and reduce the amount of light.

Keith - remember the pic I sent you of the really worn Guardala? It 
was done on a Canon A60 using these techniques.

down to 1 cm. Also the minimum distance is usually at full wide, so 
you can&#39;t get away with zooming in when you are in macro mode.

act as a close-up lens--you&#39;ll need to check your focus on the LCD 
screen on the camera to get it exactly right. The stronger the lens 
the closer you can get--you can change the magnification by changing 
the zoom. This will degrade the sharpness marginally but not enough 
to make any real difference.

Agree, with the caveats that with care you can do decently without a tripod 
and that a high ISO setting increases noise somewhat, but usually not that 
much unless you are at 1600, and a high ISO setting allows for both greater 
depth of field and a higher shutter speed so often the tradeoff is 
worthwhile. Diffusing the flash is a very good idea. Thinner paper farther 
from the flashtube gives more light and diffuses it even better.

2MP will not give you a decent 8x10.  There&#39;s just not enough information
there.  If you are printing to your color printer you need to be able to
print at around 200 dpi.  There&#39;s a host of arguments about if anything is
gained by printing at 300 dpi on a color printer - not worth getting into
here.  The bottom line is that a 6 MP is going to give the average user
usable 8x10&#39;s.  I might get something I like out of it depending upon the
camera.  In the Canon world, I have big glass and the first affordable
digital SLR that Canon has brought out that appeals to me is the 20D.  It&#39;s
reasonably fast and has enough resolution to approach or surpass film
(depends on the film - IMHO).

Use a tripod - the best advice anyone can give.  The other thing I would say
is know your equipment.  My wife recently got some amazing images from her 3
MP point and shoot because she knows her equipment so well.

I used the A60 for a lot of shots, but I&#39;ve replaced it with an 8Mp 
Canon Pro 1.

The best thing for me is being able to use off camera flash. Much 
better control over lighting and reflections that way.

For product shots on the web though, a 2Mp cam does just fine...

I just bought my daughter a Sony 93, 5 Meg (closing out). Mostly selected
it because it takes short videos better than most.  Twice the resolution
and frames/sec.  She does not want to take a lot of videos, but liked the
few snipets I took with my camera.

I admit that 2Mpx is getting down to the limit but an 8x10 viewed at a distance of 1 ft or so will look fine.

I heartily disagree, however, that you need 6 Mpx for a good 8x10. I&#39;ve done lots of experiments with a 4000 ppi film scanner and resizing in PS and you usually will not see any marked improvement in prints after 150 ppi--which translates into a file 1200x1500 for an 8x10 or 1.8 Mpx. And yes I do have a good photo printer and I sell prints as well as being a photographer for the Photonica agency.

  camera.  In the Canon world, I have big glass and the first affordable

  MP point and shoot because she knows her equipment so well.

  2Mp is OK for 8x10&#39;s, but you&#39;re better to keep them to 5x7 at most.

  As far as getting better closeups:

  1. Tripod

  2. Macro mode at the wide angle setting

  3. Slow ISO setting

  4. Sunlight OR cover the on camera flashtube with a double layer of
  20lb copy paper to diffuse and reduce the amount of light.

  Keith - remember the pic I sent you of the really worn Guardala? It
  was done on a Canon A60 using these techniques.

  Agree, with the caveats that with care you can do decently without a tripod 
  and that a high ISO setting increases noise somewhat, but usually not that 
  much unless you are at 1600, and a high ISO setting allows for both greater 
  depth of field and a higher shutter speed so often the tradeoff is 
  worthwhile. Diffusing the flash is a very good idea. Thinner paper farther 
  from the flashtube gives more light and diffuses it even better.

I took this pic with a 2mp camera on macro mode. It look good to me and you 
can zoom in fairly close.
I think the camera was a little less than a foot away.

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

As you know opinions vary on what is the right amount of DPI for printing.  I personally prefer to error on the side of too much rather than not enough.  My preference is to still shoot with film cameras and scan when necessary.  The 20D is the first offering from Canon that offers the amount of features and speed that I consider reasonable for my use.  I use to shoot a lot of autoracing but these days stick to taking photos of family or nature.  Regardless the idea of being able to stick a few 1 GB Compact Flash cards in my pocket and having the ability to store about 90 images per is something that bears looking into down the road.

---------------------------I&#39;m taking it with a grain of salt...I&#39;ve got an old 3Mpx Fuji point and shoot and it gives me surprisingly good 8x10s. Much better than I expected. I admit that 2Mpx is getting down to the limit but an 8x10 viewed at a distance of 1 ft or so will look fine.

I heartily disagree, however, that you need 6 Mpx for a good 8x10. I&#39;ve done lots of experiments with a 4000 ppi film scanner and resizing in PS and you usually will not see any marked improvement in prints after 150 ppi--which translates into a file 1200x1500 for an 8x10 or 1.8 Mpx. And yes I do have a good photo printer and I sell prints as well as being a photographer for the Photonica agency.

I also have a Canon...PowerShot A40. If you use the manual mode and
set a slow exposure with very small aperture, then light the specimen

This works better with film in a manual camera, but I have had some
success on closeups.

            <pre class='message__body'>I experimented some last night.  I think my biggest problem was that I was
too far away by standing over the piece placed on a table.  I was using
some zoom which gets real blurry on close-ups.  Using no zoom (wide) and
getting 2-3 inches away was mucho better.  I think I tried up close a long
time ago but did not have the macro mode on at the time.

I think using a single focus point will help.  I still need to play with a
tripod and high ISO w/natural light vs low ISO w/diffused flash and other
supplimentary lighting.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, since you are doing close-up work you might try one of those cheap high intensity lights quite close to the mpc. The biggest advantage with using a hot light instead of flash is that you can position it to best light the work--for instance way to the side to highlight the rail and leave the baffle darker, or wherever it needs to be to avoid specular reflection off polished metal surfaces. If you decide to get fancy you can also bounce it off of a white surface--like a piece of styrofoam--to get a soft light. Best of all you can see the effect with your eye, unlike when using a flash.

  I experimented some last night.  I think my biggest problem was that I was
  too far away by standing over the piece placed on a table.  I was using
  some zoom which gets real blurry on close-ups.  Using no zoom (wide) and
  getting 2-3 inches away was mucho better.  I think I tried up close a long
  time ago but did not have the macro mode on at the time.

  I think using a single focus point will help.  I still need to play with a
  tripod and high ISO w/natural light vs low ISO w/diffused flash and other
  supplimentary lighting.

Just watch out for the colour balance - you probably have tungsten 
lights, and that tends to make things very yellowish/overly warm in 
tone. Halogens are usually fine though.

I don&#39;t know if anyone already mentioned it, but especially from a 
lighting standpoint, taking pictures of mouthpieces is much like 
jewelry photography. Do a google search on light boxes and you&#39;ll get 
a bunch of tips:

I thought that I&#39;d add that I built a 14" by 14" light box from a 
plastic bin with the sides cut out to make a frame and a thin cotton 
sheet stretched over three sides. Then a couple of clip-on goose-neck 
high-intensity desk lamps (about $10 a piece) to provide the diffused 
lighting through the cotton sheet. Then some velvet material to put 
the piece to photograph on.

Works great for taking pictures of all sorts of small objects.
