Ive been working on a large chambered mouthpiece for the past week.  It 
seems that every time I try to lengthen the facing it becomes a bit 
tubby sounding and the highs loose something.  The piece was made with 
a facing of 20.  Even at 22 it starts falling apart.  Currently Im at 
about 21 and it may be fine.  Am I doomed to have to work with baffles 
if I am to lengthen the facing on this piece?  I really dont care for 
them.  If given the choice between a baffle and a piece that requires a 
bit more work to play I may choose to work harder.  Is this my choice 
or are there other options?

You should feel fortunate that there is a solution to your problem, not
doomed.  The key is moderation.  Just try a small baffle to get rid of the
tubbys.  You can also try roll-overs and short straight baffle.  These are
best done with the material you "gain" as you open a tip up.  You can also
try filling the sidewalls in to make them straight.  (This may lead you
away from Links to get a sound you want.)  

JVW liked to coat the entire chamber of some Links with a layer of J-B weld
epoxy to make them smaller.  But this may not hold up well over time.  I
have repaired 2 of them for clients.
