            <pre class='message__body'>This is my first post here.  I&#39;m relatively new to the world of 
mouthpiece work, and don&#39;t know much, but I&#39;m hoping this group will 
give me some tips.

I have a question relating to a sax mouthpiece I&#39;ve got.  It&#39;s an old 
plastic Conn piece called a Comet.  I haven&#39;t been able to find any 
information on them, and have only seen a couple on eBay (I have been 
lucky enough to snag one for both alto and tenor).  It&#39;s a great 
piece, very responsive and reed-friendly, although it has some tuning 
problems in the altissimo register and tends to be a bit bright.

However, it&#39;s made of incredibly cheap plastic.  Both of my pieces 
has cracks through the base and deep tooth marks, and I doubt that 
either one will last more then a couple more years.

Is there anyone out there who could make an exact copy of my 
mouthpiece out of a stronger material?

            <pre class='message__body'>Andy:  The Conn Comet was produced back in the 50&#39;s.

During the late 1930&#39;s Santy Runyon was one of the three man design team
for Conn for the Conn Constellation alto sax.  I know, people say... but
that wasn&#39;t made until the 1950&#39;s, you must have your dates wrong.  No,
the instrument was being developed in the late 30&#39;s, early 40&#39;s, but
WWII caused all production to be switched to war production.  Then,
after WWII, there were several years while people found jobs, and the
country got back on its feet, and people began buying luxury items.  The
Constellation was not marketed until the early 1950&#39;s.

The Conn Comet was specially designed by Santy Runyon for the
Constellation alto sax.  He also designed Comet tenor and baritone
models.  Unfortunately, no Constellation tenor or baritone sax was
designed.  Runyon produced these mouthpieces for Conn.

They were produced in a transparent amber color, a Conn decision to
match the gold lacquer of the Constellation alto.  They were also made
in an ivory color and black.  I have only seen baritone models in these
two colors.  All of the altos and tenors I have seen were transparent
amber.  In my personal collection I have an amber alto and tenor, and
black baritone Comet.

Plastics then were not what they are today, and yes, they crack at the
shank sometimes.  They can be banded as a repair.

It might interest you to know that Marshall Royal, lead alto of the
Count Basie Orchestra, played the Conn Comet mouthpiece.

These mouthpieces play quite well, with a near classical tone, yet with
good projection.

The Runyon Model 88 baritone sax mouthpiece is nearly identical to the
Comet bari sax mouthpiece, except for the shank, which is plain on the
88, fluted on the Comet.  The Runyon Model 88 alto and tenor are quite
similar to the Comets externally, again, differing on the shank.  But
the chambers are somewhat larger and more rounded on the Comets.

His site is in the Links area.

But I would persue a Runyon before copying a Comet.

I agree.  If you like the Comet, you&#39;ll probably love the Runyon 
Custom. www.runyonproducts.com

            <pre class='message__body'>The Runyon SR has a chamber very close to the Comet, as well as tone and 
response.  It is current production, available only in transparent red 
and black.

            <pre class='message__body'>Wow, I didn&#39;t expect such a response from my question.  Thanks to 
everyone who gave advice.  I am looking into the runyon piece now.

Mr. Coats, you say that all alto and tenor comets you&#39;ve seen have 
been amber.  My tenor piece is (and it looks horrid with my silver 
horn), but my alto piece is black.  Is it more valuable then the 
yellow ones?

Anyways, thanks for all the help.
