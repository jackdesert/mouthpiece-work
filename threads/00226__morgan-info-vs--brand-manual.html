            <pre class='message__body'>Browsing some archieved email about MPC refacing on www.sneezy.org, I 
ran across some information stating the pamphlet Ralph Morgan 
includes, or used to include, in his mouthpiece kit is simply the 
same chapter about refacing that&#39;s in the old Erick Brand/Selmer band 
instrument repair manual.  Can anyone verify this one way or the 
other?

Thanks.

            <pre class='message__body'>That would not surprise me, since Ralph Morgan worked for Selmer.  But
regardless of the age of the manual, the information there is just as
relevant today as it was then.

There was a small hardback book by Eric Brand on mouthpiece refacing,
and it was simply the chapter from the Eric Brand band inst repair
manual, now being reprinted and sold by Ferree�s.  So, if you have the
full manual, don�t waste money looking for, or buying the mouthpiece
manual.

I have a dial caliper from MicroMark, which sells for about $35, which I
find to be more than adequate.

For polishing, I use Kit Scratch-Out, a polish for Plexiglass
windshields and other plastics.

Keith and I need to get together on the Runyon articles, which have good
info on how various facing contours and baffle shapes affect the
clarinet tone and response.  These are equally applicable to saxophone.
I will see about retyping all the text, and perhaps scanning or maybe
even redrawing the sketches, and putting all into a pdf file.  Then
Keith can post them for download.

These three one-page articles are from a magazine, Woodwind World,
written in 1960, titled �On Clarinet Mouthpieces�.  There were six other
articles written by Runyon in the old Woodwind magazine, about 1952-53,
titled �The Mouthpiece Story�.  These are listed in the bibliography of
older prints of The Art Of Saxophone Playing, by Larry Teal.  The old
versions had a bibliography, the current printing does not.  Larry Teal
used these articles, and interviews with Santy Runyon at his studio in
Chicago, for his mouthpiece chapter in his book.  These articles are
several pages each, according to the bibliography.
