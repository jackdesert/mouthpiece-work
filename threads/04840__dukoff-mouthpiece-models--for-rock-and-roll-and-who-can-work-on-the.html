            <pre class='message__body'>I have decided on buying( it fits my budget and is a good mouthpiece) a Dukoff tenor mouthpiece for my saxophone, however, there seems to be all different chambers, example P,S,X...I supoose they are all "power chambers" but which one would be best for Rock and Roll...they all say they project well and all have edge, but again which one would be best for rock and roll....???
  The second problem is the "silverlite" metal is very soft and dents easily. Is there anything that can be done to harden the metal, like cryoing(cryogenics) the mouthpiece??? I know they do crogenics (low temperator freezing )on saxophones, but would it work on a mouthpiece to harden the metal. I can cryo it myself with liquid nitrogen, if I was given the submerssion time.....and ,if it would in fact,help.
  The third problem is who will work on Dukoff mouthpiece,like making sure the rales are even that the table was flat, and so one....

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree with Paul: Dukoff&#39;s are just TOO soft! There are plenty of high
baffle/small chamber mouthpieces out there that will give you a rock and
roll sound.
 
I&#39;ve had lots of my personal mouthpieces cryoed. Unlike the horn itself,
cryo doesn&#39;t seem to have ANY effect on mouthpieces. I keep trying, but have
never found any benefit. I do have all of my personal saxophones cryoed, and
don&#39;t understand people who don&#39;t do likewise....

Dukoff has quite a following.  Even one of my idols, Boots Randolph loves

But the silverite material is so soft that just measuring with glass gauge
and feelers damages the table and rails.  I no longer accept Dukoffs for any

You really should test play mouthpieces to find out what works for you.
Either at a retail outlet, or through local sellers. Woodwind & Brasswind
will let you try up to 3 mouthpieces at a time, with a modest fee for
disinfecting them on return. Likewise, many mouthpiece makers and refacers
will let you purchase mouthpieces with a test-play return policy.

Test-playing doesn&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;ll still like your purchase 1-2
months later, but it helps you rule out pieces that you find unplayable or
unsuitable.

I wonder if some kind of metal plating could create a hard surface that
would make these mouthpieces more durable. Chrome plate might accomplish
this, IIRC it&#39;s a very hard surface, but how does it stand up to saliva?
(chromium salts are quite toxic).  Also, plating would alter the dimensions
of the rails slightly, and not necessarily for the better.

            <pre class='message__body'>The newer Dukoffs I have worked on the past couple of years are
Nickel-plated on the outside.  The chamber, table and rails are not plated.
 This gives the piece a tad more strength and it does not get so ugly over
time.

There were plastic and brass Dukoffs made, but you need to keep an eye on
eBay for a while to find them.
