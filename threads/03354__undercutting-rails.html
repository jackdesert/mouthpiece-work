            <pre class='message__body'>Aside from removing material from the mpc and thus making the chamber 
larger does undercutting in the rail section have significant tonal 
influences that removal from the floor doesn not?  ie...does it make 
for a huskier sound or do both achieve making for a darker tone?

            <pre class='message__body'>I think curved sidewalls and curved baffles/roof (or floor depending on you
terminology) do much the same thing.  They trade off between
darkness/spread and brightness/focus.  Generally, changes in the baffle
area seem to have more impact.

Two extremes to consider are a high baffle RPC with curved sidewalls as
compared to a Wagner that has a low baffle and narrow window with tall
straight sidewalls. Both have a complex sound that is very interesting. 
Its like comparing a bright mouthpiece on a dark sax to a dark mouthpiece
on a bright sax (or bright player).  Next to the player, the mouthpiece
dominates.  But you can still hear the lesser effects in side-by-side testing.
