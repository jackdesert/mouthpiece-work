            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,
I hope you are well.
I&#39;ll take 5 please.
I will want to make them Brecker 1&#39;s and 2&#39;s so ones with the large 
chambers would be good. If you have them without the flutes, that would 
be great.
Please advise how to pay and postage normal air post to

            <pre class='message__body'>I have had much more interest in these than I expected.  I priced them under what I thought you could buy Asian mouthpieces on eBay for, thinking they were serving the inexpensive "one off" mouthpiece blank market.  I think I misjudged that. 

 So I have $ in hand so to speak for 15 of these.  Ross, Steven, Eduard.
 

 6 other buyers are interested in 1-20 of these but no $ has been sent.  Julian, Dimitri, Matt, Paul, Richard, Fraser.   Two of you wanted 20 pr more but I can not fill those unless someone pulls out.  The max I can fill is 10 and try to get some blanks to everyone who has been in contact with me.  
 

 So I will put a freeze on any new orders for now.  I will take payment until 8 AM Friday my time (~ 23 hrs from now).  If they are not sold out, I will report back the the buyers who wanted 20 but I could only commit to 10.
