I hope you are well.
I&#39;ll take 5 please.
I will want to make them Brecker 1&#39;s and 2&#39;s so ones with the large 
chambers would be good. If you have them without the flutes, that would 
be great.
Please advise how to pay and postage normal air post to

            <pre class='message__body'>I have had much more interest in these than I expected.  I priced them under what I thought you could buy Asian mouthpieces on eBay for, thinking they were serving the inexpensive "one off" mouthpiece blank market.  I think I misjudged that. 

 So I have $ in hand so to speak for 15 of these.  Ross, Steven, Eduard.
 

 6 other buyers are interested in 1-20 of these but no $ has been sent.  Julian, Dimitri, Matt, Paul, Richard, Fraser.   Two of you wanted 20 pr more but I can not fill those unless someone pulls out.  The max I can fill is 10 and try to get some blanks to everyone who has been in contact with me.  
 

 So I will put a freeze on any new orders for now.  I will take payment until 8 AM Friday my time (~ 23 hrs from now).  If they are not sold out, I will report back the the buyers who wanted 20 but I could only commit to 10.

Objet: [MouthpieceWork] Brass Tenor Sax Mouthpiece Blanks For Sale 






I have a bunch of mouthpiece blanks I am selling for $18 each. 5 for $80, 10 for $150. All have high baffles and small to medium throats. Many are similar to a DG King design. But they do vary since these were prototypes made by Carlos Atti of Italy. They play as-is but need hand finishing and plating. They can be customized by enlarging the chamber, lowering the baffle and putting your own facing on it. Some are engraved and most have side flutes on the body. Email me if interested and I can send you a spreadsheet of what I have. The photos on my site are a sampling of what is available.
