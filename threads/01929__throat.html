Question to experts.
What is the role of THROAT (shape where the chamber meets the bore)? How its size and form (square, circle, horseshoe etc.) influences a sound? What size and form of throat is the best, in your opinion?

Thanks,

This is not a well understood area.  My impression is that straight 
surfaces add brightness, curved are darker.  But size is a big deal 
too.  Large and rectangular can be darker than small and round.  

Part of what confuses things is that (I think) the baffle design has 
a bigger effect on the tone and makes it difficult to compare the 
throats from two different mouthpieces because their baffles are not 
the same.  Baffles and chambers/throats work together to give the 
piece its tonal character.

Eperimentation is difficult too since you need to consider if the 
results you are getting are due to the change in chamber volume as 
opposed to the chamber shape (or a little of both).
