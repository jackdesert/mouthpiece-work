            <pre class='message__body'>We&#39;re still figuring this out, and NOBODY&#39;S CONFIDENTIAL DATA WAS  
COMPROMISED, but sombody got into our server last night and is using  
it to send out their own messages. This spam will NOT say anything  
about Nation of Music, Saxgourmet etc.....they are just using our IP  
address to send their messages, or at least they were until my ever  
vigilant webmeister, Eddy, put a stop to it! This is fairly common,  
since the spammers IP was probably blocked, they just look around for  
another server which is not blocked to send their messages. They do  
NOT have access to customer data, forum membership lists etc., as that  
is stored elsewhere. While Eddy gets this figured out, there will be  
no email coming out of our server, so the "ask Steve" function and new  
member requests for the www.nationofmusic.com forum will be  
temporarily disabled. We&#39;re on it, and will have it fixed as soon as  
humanly possible. They sent about 7000 emails using our server. The  
emails all went to THEIR mailing list, not ours, and made no reference  
to us. It appears at this time that they are simply using our servers  
capacity, and not any data from our server.

On another note, somebody (and we are pretty sure we know who) has  
been opening email accounts at various places using our registered  
trademark "saxgourmet".....go figure......I guess imitation is the  
most sincere form of flattery.....the ONLY email we use with  
"saxgourmet" is saxgourmet@........if it&#39;s not from there, it&#39;s  
NOT from us!
