When we talk about the opposite problem: how to avoid all the high notes split - the solution is to make the baffle just behind the tip rail lower, and maybe do the last part of the rails closest to the tip flatter. So I would think it is an advantage of high baffle just behind the tip rail and that the latter part of the curve (nearest the tip) is slightly higher than what one would normally have made&#8203;&#8203;.
