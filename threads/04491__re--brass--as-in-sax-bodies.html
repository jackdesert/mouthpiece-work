I accept that mouthpiece material has less effect on tone than design
characteristics and player input.
In my experience this does not apply to saxophone material.
I once owned a Grafton acrylic alto which was dead compared to a brass
one.
I had to change my steel Larsen 100/00SMS which Berg had custom made 
for me, to a low baffle bronse Lawton, just to tame the high frequency
response, when changing from a cheap tenor to a Selmer MKVI.
The experiment with a sax made out of concrete, gave a saxophone sound
 apparently, but I bet it would have been rich in harmonics if it had
been made from top quality brass.    Eddie

The only thing that really matters is the bore geometry. Certainly brass composition plays a large part in the sound of pipe organ reeds; a maker told me that it is impossible to duplicate the sound of old pipe organs because there is no way to get modern brass with so many impurities...But this is because the reed is doing the vibrating, coupling to the air column inside the pipe; in a sax it is the cane reed that sets the air column to vibrating, and the metal body is only there to define and delimit the air column - the minor vibrations of the body are on the order of 10000x smaller than those of the air column and are insignificant to the final sound.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree the material makes no difference -- I believe what gives the 
vintage horns most of their character is the tuning centers for each 
note.  In later horns they placed the tone holes and adjusted bore 
geometry for a more "perfect" tuning, but that took away the voice 
those horns had.  For instance, an old Balanced Action has certain 
notes that are tuned much differently than modern horns.  Hearing the 
players from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s (and earlier) is what forms a lot of 
opinions on what is a great sax sound, with their intonation 
tendencies.  Those differences are pretty much subliminal, so people 
tend to think it&#39;s the material that&#39;s doing it, when it&#39;s the 
different designs and craftsmen that were making the horns. My 2 
cents anyway.... Thanks, Ken

Possibly tone hole diameters too.  

Does anyone know if the Selmer Reference Saxes try to match bore and

            <pre class='message__body'>I think this is quite true. Comparing my old Conn soprano to a modern Yani is quite telling. The Conn is like a car that oversteers, you have to do a lot of work to keep the tuning right--small embouchure changes seem to lead to big intonational variations. Not so the Yani, it understeers. As you say, it has much more solid intonational "centers". Most modern sops have a "hump" near the top of the bore--an area of wider flare--which helps accomplish this. And yet in terms of response and tone quality (IMO) the Conn wins hands down. These things are not unrelated.

Bore designs are always compromises between various factors. I learned this from making shakuhachi flutes, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, where the bores are handmade and changeable. It&#39;s true that there are fairly strict limits to what constitutes a decent bore--get outside of those specs and things really fall apart--but within the critical range there are countless variations that work well, and what you sacrifice for what is a matter or taste.

For instance, a wider bore generally gives a better low end at the expense of response and clarity at the top end. There&#39;s no real way around this; it&#39;s just a fact that a bigger bore tends to give precedence to the lower harmonics and fundamental. So every manufacturer has to try to strike a balance, and this often is predicated on the "fashion" at a given time. 

This was very clear, for instance, in oboe design. In the early part of the 20th C the ideal oboe sound was light and airy--the "French" sound, and to some extent this was also true of the flute sound. As the century progressed the fashion swung towards the darker and more powerful "German" sound, and oboe bores were completely redesigned as a direct result of that preference. Modern flutes have various headjoint modifications, such as more radically undercutting of the embouchure chimney, which result in a more powerful, clear tone, but without the lyrical airy quality which makes early flutes such as the Louis Lot so prized. 

Speaking of tuning and character: there is an interesting and relevant story about the bassoon. It is really the most primitive of woodwinds, with all kinds of compromises (such as small finger holes cut on a bias) which result in wildly varying tonal and response characteristics for different notes. A number of improved designs (and they really were improved) have been forwarded, but all have failed, because they don&#39;t sound like bassoons anymore...or at least what people have come to know as bassoons.

 vintage horns most of their character is the tuning centers for each 
 note.  In later horns they placed the tone holes and adjusted bore 
 geometry for a more "perfect" tuning, but that took away the voice 
 those horns had.  For instance, an old Balanced Action has certain 
 notes that are tuned much differently than modern horns.  Hearing the 
 players from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s (and earlier) is what forms a lot of 
 opinions on what is a great sax sound, with their intonation 
 tendencies.  Those differences are pretty much subliminal, so people 
 tend to think it&#39;s the material that&#39;s doing it, when it&#39;s the 
 different designs and craftsmen that were making the horns. My 2 
 cents anyway.... Thanks, Ken

 50s saxes for a premium? It&#39;s all bullshit. The only thing that 
 really matters is the bore geometry. Certainly brass composition 
 plays a large part in the sound of pipe organ reeds; a maker told me 
 that it is impossible to duplicate the sound of old pipe organs 
 because there is no way to get modern brass with so many 
 impurities...But this is because the reed is doing the vibrating, 
 coupling to the air column inside the pipe; in a sax it is the cane 
 reed that sets the air column to vibrating, and the metal body is 
 only there to define and delimit the air column - the minor 
 vibrations of the body are on the order of 10000x smaller than those 
 of the air column and are insignificant to the final sound.
