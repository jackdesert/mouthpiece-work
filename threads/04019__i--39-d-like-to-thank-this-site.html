            <pre class='message__body'> &lt;http://mitchellstore.com/index.html>  I just recieved my shipment of
large feeler gages with them I refaced my Oleg tenor mouthpiece it cost
$400 and was a good piece but it  always chirped when I pushed it hard.
It was scary  to work on a piece that cost me that much and the first
play test was bad it wouldnt seal at all. I kept at it and now it seals
the best I have ever seen and it plays like a dream no more chirpes. I&#39;m
selling the large feelers on my site I think you will be very happy with
them. Thanks again for all the information at this site  mitchstore

            <pre class='message__body'>I used one of your glass gauge, the one you send me, and is a simply but very good product and I think was made in the right size. In Italy we don&#39;t have kind of instrument to work, so we need to built or buy from States... but yours is sold at nice price and cheap enought to choose to buy than built and it&#39;s trouble free.
 Do you know how much it cost there a micrometer to size the inside part? A good one here is a fortune!
