Ouch! I&#39;d be very interested to know what shortcomings you felt you had in
the Oleg, what you did to it that helped... and then... what you did that
messed it up, and then what corrected it.

>OK Barry where do I start I got that mouthpiece with my Oleg gold 
plated tenor.It is a prototype and it played well except it would 
chirp when I pushed it hard. The rails were a little off so I flatten 
the table and evened the rails.I was careful not to change it much 
because I liked the sound. Every thing went well and it played great 
not more chirps.But I&#39;m always going for that little extra like make 
it look great touch up here and their.Well the next day after I 
worked on it more it didn&#39;t play as well as before.So a little more 
sanding here and there and it didn&#39;t play at all!So I start major 
work when you work them to much the tip gets real thin so you have to 
shorten it the rails are to thick you have to thin them.It took about 
3 hours or so to get it to play right.It seams like the measurements 
should be all you need to get, but I think that feel has more to do 
with getting them to play great.Anyway now it plays better then ever 
and I will never tough it again because I have no more room left to 
work it.
