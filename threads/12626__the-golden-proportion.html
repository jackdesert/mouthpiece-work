            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys...
 

 

 I just went across reading one article that featured the Fibonacci numbers and saw some circular arc drawings on that same article..
 

 From that article also I remembered an interview on Jody Espina's mouthpieces "Jody Jazz" and he mentioned in the article was his application of the Golden Ratio to his mouthpieces. 
 

 With those sources, I went to on to hypothesise the calculations that we use here esp. on the radial or circular arc. Are the formula we use here is related to the said golden proportion?
 

 

 What are your thoughts on this?
 

 

 I'm just curious
 

 

 Thanks
