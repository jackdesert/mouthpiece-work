Subject: Morgan glass gauges

Hello all,

I ran across a lot of Morgan glass gauges (they&#39;re not like my kit, so 
I don&#39;t know if they are prototypes or what, exactly but the 
measurements are accurate) at a sale and bought them.  If anyone needs 
a glass gauge, I&#39;ll be glad to sell them.  Please make an offer for 
them.  I&#39;ve got 8 of them.  Thanks.

Ben
