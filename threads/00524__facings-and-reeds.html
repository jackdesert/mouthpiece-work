            <pre class='message__body'>Absolutely.  That&#39;s why some reeds work better than others on mouthpieces of
given designs.  But it varies from player to player depending on their
morphology, which is why it&#39;s next to impossible to come up with a "use this
cut of reed on this type of mouthpiece" list.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes.

If all else remains the same:

Bigger tip openings require softer reeds.

Longer facings (but same tip opening) requires harder reeds.

A high baffle can make for easier response, feeling like a softer reed,
and vice versa, but not necessarily.

But you may find a guy who plays a #37 tip opening and uses #10 reeds...
Hah!  And there is at least one mfg (Yanagisawa) where the larger the
tip opening, the longer the facing.  So, they all play with about the
same strength reed.
