            <pre class='message__body'>Hi! 
Thank you so much! I received a mail with a Mouthpiece Facing Specs 
From Vintage Models of the 1950s from Keith Bradbury (published in 
the Saxophone Journal) and a lot of useful information from all of 
you. This year I&#39;m working in England in a Big Music Shop (MIR - 
Musical Instrument Repairs - www.mir-sales.co.uk) repairing Woodwinds 
and it is a beatiful experience. I like this work! Before I worked in 
Germany (www.luettke.de) In Februar I&#39;ll do a 3 Months Course at 
Buffet Crampon, and after I would like to work again in another 
Woodwind&#39;s Workshop. At the end of the next year..  maybe..  I&#39;ll be 
ready to open my own shop in Genoa - Italy, the City where I live. It 
is a beatiful, long way, the only I found to learn this work in a 
seriuos way. Sorry for my English, I haven&#39;t time to study in this 
period, but I&#39;ll try to improve it, because it is a very useful 
language, especially to get information about this work. So, I hope 
that in the future I could be also useful for some of you. 
My Best Wishes, Giuseppe.
Of course I&#39;ll have a lot of questions for you in the next Months!!
