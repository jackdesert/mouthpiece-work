            <pre class='message__body'>I opened up a Bari Buddy DeFranco clarinet mouthpiece #3 facing.  It is now 1.70 mm  approx   .067". (It was a requested opening from a jazz tenor player)   I decided to keep the original facing length and the next station as I didn&#39;t want to create a mouthpiece that would be "chop buster".   What I ended up with is 38, 26, 18, 12.5   .   It plays nicely with a Rico #2 reed.  The upper register needs a little attention as it tends to be low(pitch) but otherwise it plays great.   I am unable to compare this to your curves in the "files" section as I don&#39;t understand how this works.   It seems reasonable to me that a large tip opening for clarinet.....067 should have a different facing length than an alto sax with that tip opening.   Clarinet reeds being narrower and shorter are not suited to alto facing length numbers.    Any comments?    thanks   John

John, I wonder why the Jazz tenor player thinks a .67 tip on clarinet is ok?
As a player of Jazz tenor I have experimented with lays that are unconventional on clarinet. IMO the chops and reed are the limiting factors here. The extreme tip coupled with the long .748 lay, makes control of the upper register very difficult. If he treats it like a sax, he may not want to play that high anyway. The tone also becomes airy. 
For me, an open tip seems to benefit from a shorter lay on clarinet.
The reed problem then comes into play, with the narrow softer reed used, bending in quickly, closing the tip, thereby defeating the logic of choosing an extra open tipped &#39;piece.
I find as a tenor player, that .50 to .55 tips are perfectly adequate if you like something more open on clarinet.
I would be interested to know what lay he uses on tenor John.

            <pre class='message__body'>I do agree with Eddie here John, it is not easy to control the pitch with
this opening on a clarinet. When it comes to the high notes, it can be
easier to control these notes and play in tune if you give the lay a little
more curve the last 3  4mm against the tip. Not much, just a couple of
thousands of an inch. This is more common on clarinet mouthpieces than on
the sax mouthpieces.

Good luck!

 

Best Helge

            <pre class='message__body'>An extremely open tip on the clarinet is neither practical, nor sensible because of the excessive jaw pressure required to play this setup. What you are attempting will lead to many control and intonation problems as well as being very uncomfortable to play,even with a soft reed. The curve that you are using seems to be more suited to a tip opening of about .052"  

It may work out to have your client play the piece and then make the necessary adjustments to make the piece work for him, rather than target a tip opening.

If the curve I&#39;m using is more suitable to a tip opening of .052 what are the drawbacks here?  Does this big curve in the tip area create more resistance or brilliance of tone?

My suggest is simple, without touch the table, you can polish with isopropilic alcohol and peck or scratch with a needle all curvatures and tip rails, (that solutions are very aplicatte with me on most variates mouthpiece that i has reparated with all succefull result).This scratch will have very little and sufficient by allow grip the material fill.

Once that material is careful placing, the mouthpiece can be place with window down on a flat polyetiene sheet. This promote for gravity a capillarity that match between the curve and tip rails the fill material.  Maybe appear to be silliness, but i guarentee this simple system.

Never i do a final work on a mouthpiece without the collaboration of the player or performer, which will be the definitely the arbiter of our work.
Good Luck, and tell me if this solution is for you. Important: The Epoxies and cianoacrilate materials can produce allergy reaction,  please probe to do a little test first before begin the final work.

I am interested in your procedure and will read it several times before I ask a few questions.    How do you come up with numbers for facing curves?
