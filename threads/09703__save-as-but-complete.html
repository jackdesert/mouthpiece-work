            <pre class='message__body'>Hey guys
I do the following:
If I&#39;m on a page I want to keep or guard, go to SAVE AS and in the interface or 
menu appears I&#39;m going to TYPE and drop or get complete web page because it can 
not save at all. Notwithstanding this page should be accessible to be saved in 
this way, not all are. For years I do well and I have saved thousands of pages 
with all kinds of data and aids. In case you need to return to the HOME of the 
page (since it does not open from the internet but from the folder where this 
file) can search in the menu on that page that will surely have some link or 
links to other data on the same page . Let&#39;s face it is not always feasible 
because some pages will not allow it or have links or connections and also 
because they have disappeared or been deleted.
Fraternal greetings
Silverio
