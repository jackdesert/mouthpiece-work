            <pre class='message__body'>I created a new Links section with a few interesting Patent Links.  
You can search the US patent site quite a while by doing searches and 
clicking on the older patents that the newer patents reference.

To see the images, you may need to download and install an upgrade to 
your browser.  Links to a free one is on the patent site.

If anyone finds one really interesting, go ahead and add it to the 
Patent Links.
