            <pre class='message__body'>Micromark also sells some rubber molding material.  It can be poured in, 
and after it set up, the flexibility of the rubber allows it to be 
pulled out of the chamber.

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Baffle memorizing by a high plasticity metal</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>

Canadian Office Depot (it may have other name in USA?) sells some 
item for a curve copying on drawings. It is a square lead wire coated 
with thick PVC. A naked wire size is about 4x4 mm.It does not flexes, 
only bends. It is bad thou that Lead is toxic, especially its grey 
oxide dust which  goes into skin or a MP material.  Probably there is 
proper elastic paint available which would stay on the wire as a sock 
even after the wire is pressed against some curve.
The source item can not be used directly because it is 10 mm thick 
and has two steel strips inside, making the &#39;memorizer&#39; bend in only
(!) plane and not too much. 
The square wire may be based on the table and a tip and &#39;remember&#39; 
the baffle shape and a window size.
I did not try.
