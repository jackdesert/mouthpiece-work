            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:

Does anyone have a set of meaurements, (morgan tools) for a good 
Soloist G  rubber soprano mouthpiece?  Also for a D, and E?

I am still trying to figure out the chart from msg. 1453.

Thanks,

BK

            <pre class='message__body'>Who knows WHAT the measurements should be from Selmer? 

A good facing length is 18-19 mm.

.0015"    18 mm
.0010      13 mm

Tip opening  D = .051", E = .053", F = .057", G = .061" 

This is what they SHOULD be... they all vary, facing lengths vary.

I snagged a chart off of the web a while back that listed the tip openings
and facing lengths for all the Selmer MPs.  Like Paul says, they can vary
so much the chart is just a guide.

I&#39;ll see if I can work something up for these.

            <pre class='message__body'>I measured a S80 C* just this afternoon... one side rail (back onto the 
table actually) was 23.5 mm with the .0015" feeler, the other side was 
17 mm.  After several sheets of cutting paper, I got the table flat.  I 
measured a S90 180 facing ALTO a few weeks ago, with a 16 mm facing 
length, and a ridiculously small tip opening.

With Selmers, I commonly see warped tables and facings, and out of spec 
tip openings.  No wonder players complain that you have to try more than 
a few to "find a good one".

I do not see why that fine company tolerates that.

> Hi:
I have been refacing Selmers all week, as they totally
lack any quality control.  Dig this... the Selmer
Tenor, (a "C star") that never sounded good for me was
actually LEES THAN A B STAR in tip opening.  I worked
on it for about four hours, and now its a pretty good
"E", but really; these things are out there.

Hi:

That would be great.  I love Gerry.  I grew up in
ersey, and used to hear him play at Gulliver&#39;s and
took some lessons from him in the early 80&#39;s at the
Ramapo Jazz clinic.

Peace,

BK
