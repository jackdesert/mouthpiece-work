            <pre class='message__body'>Some of each. Mostly a strength gauge. I didn&#39;t have samples of some,
although I did have some of most. We accumulated as many reeds in as many
strengths as we could get when we were developing the Saxgourmet reeds. I&#39;ve
got a bunch of old discontinued brands as well, but they are all so old that
I think a strength test would be irrelevant.
