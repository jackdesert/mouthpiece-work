            <pre class='message__body'>Cosmo, 

i think it is a link but it is not one that is identified on mouthpiece heaven it has two sets of double lines on the shank with what appears to be an mark on top of the shank; it appears to have some marking on the body, perhaps a serial number. it appears to be a florida version. but it is not like anything I have ever seen.
