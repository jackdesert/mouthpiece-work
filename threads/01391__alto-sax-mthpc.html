They have a lot more traffic than we do on general sax questions.

Now, what is your experiance level and what kind of music/sound are you
interested in?

            <pre class='message__body'>That depends on what you are looking to play.

 

For classical you could look at the Selmer S80&#39;s (although I am not a big
fan of them) or if you want to spend a little more and get a much better
piece you could get a Morgan 3C (really nice piece).

 

For Jazz you can look at all of the Meyer like pieces including the Vandoren
V16 A5M, Morgan makes a Meyer like piece, Runyon Custom, and maybe even a
Meyer if you can find a good one.

 

I like the old Selmer Scroll Shank and Soloist pieces a lot.

 

There&#39;s many more choices so gives us an idea about your setup and what
sound you are looking for and you&#39;ll be sure to get some great
recommendations.  In the end you will have to try a variety of pieces and
find the right one for you.

I want to start looking at alto-sax mouthpieces.  What are some that 
might be a good to try so that I can narrow out some choices, 
between costing $50&lt;x>$200?

Never seen or heard of a Dukoff V8. Dukoff currently makes their 
silverite mouthpieces in the following chambers: S, D, P, M, L and X. 
They also made an F chamber that is now discontinued.

Maybe the V chamber is something new?

:-)

It&#39;s the "right" mouthpiece if it&#39;s right for you!

"without any bad sides"? Depends on your perspective. I personally
don&#39;t like Dukoff&#39;s (though, I&#39;ve never tried a "V"8) - never heard 
of one - the Dukoff models I&#39;m familiar with are: D, M, L, P, X.

I find them to be overly bright and rather thin and strident 
sounding. But, it&#39;s just not my bag. Lots of people play on them and 
sound great!

Good luck!
-Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>Nathan,
You can do a search here and on the SOTW forums to get lots of 
opinions on the modern Dukoff mouthpieces.

I&#39;ve used Dukoffs on SAT almost exclusively for 20 years. When I 
first tried a Dukoff, I fell in love with its unique sound, but it 
was difficult for me to control (avoid reed chirps, tone it down to 
blend in a sax section). I ended up using it in the studio and in 
small groups and went back to a more moderate piece for playing in a 
section. After a while, I found I could tone the Dukoff down and 
switched to using it exclusively on tenor. On alto, I sometimes 
switch to a HR Lakey for big band situations.

You also have to watch out, because there are a lot Dukoffs running 
around out there that have defects (crooked facings, badly formed tip 
rails, etc.) I have a drawer full of bad Dukoffs that I&#39;ve collected 
over the years. Just recently, I&#39;ve started going through them one by 
one to fix whatever problem they might have.

Also, the alloy used in these mouthpieces is very soft. Drop a Dukoff 
and its a doorstop.

So, that is my take on these mouthpieces.
I hope this helps.
Jon
