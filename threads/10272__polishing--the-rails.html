            <pre class='message__body'>Grooves shouldn&#39;t be a problem once you deal with any burr raised from cutting them.  But I would double check the flatness of your table first.  With a flat polished table and wet reed the surface tension of the water should keep the reed stable enough IME.  Reed sliding around might be a sign of a slight Berginess to the table.

            <pre class='message__body'>I would say your table is slightly convex too.  Otherwise, just don&#39;t polish the table this way.  Rouge residue may be a lubricant.

            <pre class='message__body'>I turn a piece of 600 or 800 silicon carbide paper over, backside up.  I make several strokes polishing the table, then one or two on the facing. 

There is just enough very fine silicon carbide dust on the paper that it gives a very fine polish.

That&#39;s it!

      For metal mpcs, jeweler&#39;s rouge on a soft cloth will give you a mirror shine. I made the mistake of polishing the table too , and the reed slides like a hockey puck. I&#39;m considering cutting crossed grooves in in my lower table to avert that problem. Can anyone see how that would be a problem?

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah, it&#39;s true that the back end of the table is rounded.  The major part was flat, but the butt end was not contacting the table, and that along with the smooth surface was allowing the reed to slide. Leaving the table rough also helped. No need for grooves. Thanks.

Purely cosmetic.  It looks good to your customer.

Just like when your freshly repaired car is returned with greasy fingerprints and footprints on the carpet, vs. a clean car with the interior vacuumed and clean.

            <pre class='message__body'>Of course its purely cosmetic. Certainly not suggesting a job should be returned dirty; only that jeweler&#39;s rouge is overkill.
