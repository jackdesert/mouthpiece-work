            <pre class='message__body'>I have been reading the posts and today I finally got the nerve to pull out some 400 grit sand paper and clean up the table on my old Bobby Dukoff Tenor Sax mouthpiece.  I was amazed at how mis-shapen the table was.  I purchased the mouthpiece used about 16 years ago and it is a little beat up.  I can&#39;t believe how much better the sound is.  It&#39;s like night and day and it only took a few strokes over the sand paper to clean it up.  My question is this, I am getting a motorboat sound, flutter/gargle on the low end, particularly low D.  Is there a way to correct this?  I have tried this mouthpiece on two horns and it is happening on both, with the same note.  I don&#39;t have that problem with I play my Bobby Dukoff D7.  Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Thanks, 
Gerry

            <pre class='message__body'>After flattening the table, did you compensate for how much you shortened the facing?  Blend the back of the facing curve into the table gently and see if that helps.

After flattening the table, did you compensate for how much you shortened
the facing? Blend the back of the facing curve into the table gently and see
if that helps.

            <pre class='message__body'>You might try putting the mouthpiece slightly farther onto the neck and playing with a slightly looser embouchure to bring the pitch back down.  It is also important that the low C key opening at the front of the key is at least 1/3 the diameter of the low C tonehole for the low D to vent properly.

Thank you for all of the help and suggestions.  I need to get a glass gauge so that I can compare the curve of my Dukoff 7 to the 4.  I don&#39;t want to mess it up.  I will give your tips a try as soon as I get the gauge.

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>That seems pretty high, with a long key throw even at that height.

On my tenor and soprano, set up by Les Arbuckle, the pad height is about 1/4
of the tone-hole diameter.

I concur with others, that having flattened his table a bit, his facing
curve no longer transitions smoothly at the break, causing this problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>Any venting in excess of 30% of the tone hole diameter makes no difference
whatsoever
