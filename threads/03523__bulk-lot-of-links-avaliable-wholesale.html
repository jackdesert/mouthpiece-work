            <pre class='message__body'>I hope its ok to post this here.  If I didnt think it may interest some 
those who reface I would not.  I thought the opportunity to get these 
pieces at wholesale rates might interest memebers.  I am selling:

1 (maybe 2) metal NY Links 7

3 Link STM 7*  1 has been opened and only looked at

2 Hard rubber Tone edge 7  Plastic bags still sealed on both

I will sell these as a single lot  

Metal pieces $98  

Hard Rubber $58


PLEASE DO NOT POST REPLYS HERE!  EMAIL ME.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think it is fine to post ads for mouthpiece work related products and
"blanks".  Other music and sax-related ads are also OK but I would not like
to see us hammered by them.  There are better forums to post these at. 
This is a niche group with a small membership.
