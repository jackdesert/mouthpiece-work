Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit our best wishes 
for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low stress, 
non-addictive, gender neutral, celebration of the winter solstice 
holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the religious 
persuasion of your choice, or secular practices of your choice, with 
respect for the religious/secular persuasions and/or traditions of 
others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions 
at all . . .

. . and a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling, and medically 
uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted 
calendar year 2005, but not without due respect for the calendars of 
choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make 
our business and our personal lives great, and without regard to the race, 
creed, color, age, physical ability, religious faith, choice of computer
platform, or 
sexual preference of the wishee.

(By accepting this greeting, you are accepting these terms. This 
greeting is subject to clarification or withdrawal. It is freely 
transferable with no alteration to the original greeting. It implies no 
promise by the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for 
her/himself or others, and is void where prohibited by law, and is 
revocable at the sole discretion of the wisher. This wish is warranted 
to perform as expected within the usual application of good tidings for 
a period of one year, or until the issuance of a subsequent holiday 
greeting, whichever comes first, and warranty is limited to replacement 
of this wish or issuance of a new wish at the sole discretion of the 
wisher.)
