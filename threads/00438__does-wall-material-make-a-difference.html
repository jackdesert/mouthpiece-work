It seems that it would be a simple matter for a maker/designer to have 6 necks made of copper and 6 necks made of brass exactly to the same specifications and do a blind study with a skilled player playing the same excerpt on necks chosen at random using the same saxophone.

A spectrograph of identical long tones could also be made at the same time to compare the harmonics.

It puzzles me why no one in the sax neck business has taken the initiative to do this to back up their claims.  Perhaps they are afraid that this type of research might turn up results contrary to their marketing claims.

ads that metals/finishes make a difference, it seems to me that they
should be the ones willing to step up to the plate with some data to
back up their claims.

Cannonball Saxophones actually patented the process and concept of
adding weight/mass to specific areas of the saxophone and neck to change
the sound and did in fact include measurements of overtones in trials
with and without the materials added as a part of their patent.

Cannonball Patent
&lt;http://www.google.com/patents?id=fUXIAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4&&#92;
source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false>    The charts and
graphs are quite tedious to read and digest, but the figures do show a
greater "harmonicity" of the upper partials with the stones in the keys.
Whether this was unconsciously player induced or a result of the heavier
keys with the stones attached is anyone&#39;s guess.

Of course there has been controversy surrounding their results and how
"scientific" their tests really were, and there are differing opinions
about that.  However, the fact is that the Cannonball company was one of
the only manufacturers on record to make an effort to come up with some
data to back up their perceptions of how their saxes played differently
with different different variables in effect.

Whether they are right or wrong, I believe they should at least be given
credit for making the effort.  It would be great if more makers and
designers would make the same effort to put some science behind their
claims IMO.  And you are right Keith, it should not only apply to
saxophone makers and designers, but other instruments as well.

Letting manufacturers do their own trials and provide
their own data is putting the fox in charge of the
henhouse. No one with an interest in the results should be
doing the testing, as there are too many ways to skew
data, either consciously or unconsciously. This can and
does happen even in the most careful experiments done by
impartial and experienced researchers, which is why
nothing is released without peer review.

I am skeptical about the Cannonball data, to say the
least.

            <pre class='message__body'>No need to rehash the debate, but while I respect the CB folks for making an effort to verify their perceptions, I feel it is wrong to use such informal research publicly to give a mantle of respectability to their claims.

Anyone not familiar with the importance of rigorous scientific method, seeing all those numbers, is likely to place credence in claims that they might not if the evidence were simply, "five out of four professional saxophonists agree that our special plutonium necks give an extra glow to their sound."

As you well know, if the methodology is not impeccable, the results are garbage. Informal research is fine for determining a direction for formal research, nothing more--and certainly not for lending authority to a claim.

  I understand where you are coming from Toby, and I certainly don&#39;t want a rehash of the Cannonball topic. But I do place more respect on their attempts to produce some measurable data using scientific equipment than the anecdotal "all my friends who tried the neck said it plays better/darker/louder/brighter etc".

            <pre class='message__body'>Some manufacturers claim finish makes a difference in tone (Cannonball, among others). Some say the type of metal does (Saxgourmet among others). Some say neither(Buesher, among others) I don&#39;t think either claims have ever been backed up by research by the manufacturers.
I don&#39;t believe the finish can make any difference. It seems much too thin. I do believe the quality and type of metal can have a perceptible difference to the player, especially in the direct vibration that the player feels through his oral cavity and hands. I have two different horns with two necks that seem identical except the type of metal. In both cases the neck made with rose brass sounds darker than the one made with gold brass.

Could you direct me to your source for your statement that the Cannonball company makes the claim that the finish makes a difference in the tone?  Thanks.

The operative words here are, of course, "seem identical".
Without measurements accurate to within .1 mm you have no
substantive grounds on which to say that the material has
any effect at all. John posted a recent study in which
researchers found no significant contributions to the
sound via vibrations in walls of fifteen micrometers
thickness. The thickness of the average neck wall is about
40x thicker.

            <pre class='message__body'>Cannonball&#39;s own website where the finish options are listed and how they sound. Look under FAQs and what the sound differences are between finishes. Their marketing BS stinks just like everyone else&#39;s.

" black nickel has a big sound that projects into the room"

 "We experimented on the exact thickness of silver plating to make the horns sound the best and discovered that dipping the horn twice in the vat of silver created the perfect effect. Three times made their vibrancy decrease."

" Our unlacquered horns have a nice vintage sound."

" Our rich gold lacquered horns have a traditional sound." Rich gold lacquer, not poor gold lacquer, hmm.

"Typically iced finishes are a bit brighter."

I am surprised you are not familiar with this, John. I wonder why Cannonball hasn&#39;t done a study on the sound differences they claim for each finish as you expect other manufacturers to do. People in glass houses shouldn&#39;t throw stones.

> > I don&#39;t believe the finish can make any difference. It seems much too thin. I do believe the quality and type of metal can have a perceptible difference to the player, especially in the direct vibration that the player feels through his oral cavity and hands. I have two different horns with two necks that seem identical except the type of metal. In both cases the neck made with rose brass sounds darker than the one made with gold brass.

Your snarky comments aside Chuck.  I have heard the members of the Cannonball saxophone staff play both in person and on recordings.  I have a great deal of respect for their perceptions since Tevis, Ryan, and Randall play and acoustically adjust hundreds of saxophones each year in all of the finishes they offer.  To call their views BS shows a total ignorance and lack of respect since you have not had the same experience playing hundreds of their models from the factory, nor is your playing skill anywhere near the level of theirs. (I&#39;ve heard your recordings.) 

I have heard in person the before and after of their "acoustic customizing" of the necks on several models of saxophones they offer and it is the real deal.  These guys have "chops" and "ears" that are absolutely amazing. 

The bottom line here is that when someone is interested in buying a Cannonball, they can go to the nearest dealer and try different models in different finishes with the same set-up in the same acoustic surroundings and see for themselves which sax produces the sound and response that appeals to them the most.  With some other internet mail order vendors that is not possible and you "get what you get" without the opportunity to do side by side comparisons of different finishes and makes and models.

Ultimately it is the player&#39;s perception that counts more than anything else since the saxophone provides their personal "musical voice".   That said, I believe the Cannonball folks might be open to the idea of some type of demonstration or measurement of the difference in sound they perceive with different finishes. I will pass that on to Tevis next time he comes in our store.  Perhaps if I can get my artificial embouchure working to perfection that can be used to remove the player variable to produce more accurate results.

I do believe the quality and type of metal can have a perceptible difference to the player, especially in the direct vibration that the player feels through his oral cavity and hands. I have two different horns with two necks that seem identical except the type of metal. In both cases the neck made with rose brass sounds darker than the one made with gold brass.

But I do place more respect on their attempts to produce some measurable data using scientific equipment than the anecdotal "all my friends who tried the neck said it plays better/darker/louder/brighter etc".

I play the sax part time, about 3-5 hours a week, I run my business full time, play world class pool and have a family. I also get paid to play my horn, sometimes very well. I am not the best by a long shot, but I am having fun and getting to travel a bit too. I can&#39;t compete with guys who play every day. Checkout- Rick K and the Allnighters with the Viral Drummer himself, Steve Moore. I get to do 30+ shows a year with these guys. Right now Steve&#39;s youtube video " drummer is in the wrong gig" is about 5.5 million and climbing in all the different versions of the same video.

I have not measured the necks, that is why I wrote "seemed identical."  There very well may be small differences. Maybe they have been acoustically adjusted. I just know they play different, but look the same.

            <pre class='message__body'>There is an important element that you are overlooking Chuck and that is the interior of the bore.  Small changes in the texture of the surface and the geometry inside the bore of the instrument produce far greater changes in the sound than anything on the outside.

A saxophone in raw brass will have an acoustically different interior surface than one with silver plating or black nickel anodized plating.  The "Brute" finish which is chemically aged brass inside and out will have a different interior than a raw brass or lacquered saxophone.

It is an intellectually fallacious argument to state "If you don&#39;t believe A then you must believe B".  You will be the first to know what I actually believe when I actually make that statement, which I have not made yet because all the proof is not in.

I am not the best by a long shot, but I am having fun and getting to travel a bit too. I can&#39;t compete with guys who play every day. Checkout- Rick K and the Allnighters with the Viral Drummer himself, Steve Moore. I get to do 30+ shows a year with these guys. Right now Steve&#39;s youtube video " drummer is in the wrong gig" is about 5.5 million and climbing in all the different versions of the same video.

I have a great deal of respect for their perceptions since Tevis, Ryan, and Randall play and acoustically adjust hundreds of saxophones each year in all of the finishes they offer.  To call their views BS shows a total ignorance and lack of respect since you have not had the same experience playing hundreds of their models from the factory, nor is your playing skill anywhere near the level of theirs.

With some other internet mail order vendors that is not possible and you "get what you get" without the opportunity to do side by side comparisons of different finishes and makes and models.

That said, I believe the Cannonball folks might be open to the idea of some type of demonstration or measurement of the difference in sound they perceive with different finishes. I will pass that on to Tevis next time he comes in our store.  Perhaps if I can get my artificial embouchure working to perfection that can be used to remove the player variable to produce more accurate results.

I do believe the quality and type of metal can have a perceptible difference to the player, especially in the direct vibration that the player feels through his oral cavity and hands. I have two different horns with two necks that seem identical except the type of metal. In both cases the neck made with rose brass sounds darker than the one made with gold brass.

I am not the best by a long shot, but I am having fun and getting to travel a bit too. I can&#39;t compete with guys who play every day. Checkout- Rick K and the Allnighters with the Viral Drummer himself, Steve Moore. I get to do 30+ shows a year with these guys. Right now Steve&#39;s youtube video " drummer is in the wrong gig" is about 5.5 million and climbing in all the different versions of the same video.

I have a great deal of respect for their perceptions since Tevis, Ryan, and Randall play and acoustically adjust hundreds of saxophones each year in all of the finishes they offer.  To call their views BS shows a total ignorance and lack of respect since you have not had the same experience playing hundreds of their models from the factory, nor is your playing skill anywhere near the level of theirs. (I&#39;ve heard your recordings.)

With some other internet mail order vendors that is not possible and you "get what you get" without the opportunity to do side by side comparisons of different finishes and makes and models.

That said, I believe the Cannonball folks might be open to the idea of some type of demonstration or measurement of the difference in sound they perceive with different finishes. I will pass that on to Tevis next time he comes in our store.  Perhaps if I can get my artificial embouchure working to perfection that can be used to remove the player variable to produce more accurate results.

I do believe the quality and type of metal can have a perceptible difference to the player, especially in the direct vibration that the player feels through his oral cavity and hands. I have two different horns with two necks that seem identical except the type of metal. In both cases the neck made with rose brass sounds darker than the one made with gold brass.

But I do place more respect on their attempts to produce some measurable data using scientific equipment than the anecdotal "all my friends who tried the neck said it plays better/darker/louder/brighter etc".

            <pre class='message__body'>John, 

Since you seem to know some of the CB folks, and believe in their sincerity, why not suggest independent scientific verification of their claims? If they are right it will invalidate 150 years of scientific research and set the musical acoustics paradigm on its ear. 

Personally, between some guys who build and play instruments, and rely on their perceptions with no controlled setup, and scientists at the top of their field (as well as many others [see the bios of Coltman, Benade, Wolfe and Fletcher]), and whose methodology has been peer-reviewed, I tend to
 place more credence in the latter.

But as I say, some relative simple tests in controlled conditions would answer the question quite handily.

Show this mail to Tevis. I doubt that CB will be interested, since they have nothing to gain from such tests (except possibly to shut up doubters like me) and quite a lot to lose.

 Your snarky comments aside Chuck.  I have heard the members of the Cannonball saxophone staff play both in person and on recordings.  I have a great deal of respect for their perceptions since Tevis, Ryan, and Randall play and acoustically adjust hundreds of saxophones each year in all of the
 finishes they offer.  To call their views BS shows a total ignorance and lack of respect since you have not had the same experience playing hundreds of their models from the factory, nor is your playing skill anywhere near the level of theirs. (I&#39;ve heard your recordings.) 
 
 I have heard in person the before and after of their "acoustic customizing" of the necks on several models of saxophones they offer and it is the real deal.  These guys have "chops" and "ears" that are absolutely amazing. 
 
 The bottom line here is that when someone is interested in buying a Cannonball, they can go to the nearest dealer and try different models in different finishes with the same set-up in the same acoustic surroundings and see for themselves which sax produces the sound and response that appeals to
 them the most.  With some other internet mail order vendors that is not possible and you "get what you get" without the opportunity to do side by side comparisons of different finishes and makes and models.
 
 Ultimately it is the player&#39;s perception that counts more than anything else since the saxophone provides their personal "musical voice".   That said, I believe the Cannonball folks might be open to the idea of some type of demonstration or measurement of the difference in sound they perceive
 with different finishes. I will pass that on to Tevis next time he comes in our store.  Perhaps if I can get my artificial embouchure working to perfection that can be used to remove the player variable to produce more accurate results.

I do believe the quality and type of metal can have a perceptible difference to the player, especially in the direct vibration that the player feels through his oral cavity and hands. I have two different horns with
 two necks that seem identical except the type of metal. In both cases the neck made with rose brass sounds darker than the one made with gold brass.

            <pre class='message__body'>I appreciate your candor. However, this is exactly the problem in parsing out this whole issue. Without some controls (exact measurements, and the inability to distinguish the necks visually), it is really impossible to know what is causing any perceived differences.

 I have not measured the necks, that is why I wrote "seemed identical."  There very well may be small differences. Maybe they have been acoustically adjusted. I just know they play different, but look the same.

 A saxophone in raw brass will have an acoustically different interior surface than one with silver plating or black nickel anodized plating.  The "Brute" finish which is chemically aged brass inside and out will have a different interior than a raw brass or lacquered saxophone.
 
 It is an intellectually fallacious argument to state "If you don&#39;t believe A then you must believe B".  You will be the first to know what I actually believe when I actually make that statement, which I have not made yet because all the proof is not in.

I am not the best by a long shot, but I am having fun and getting to travel a bit too. I can&#39;t compete with guys who play

That said, I believe the Cannonball folks might be open to the idea of some type of demonstration or measurement of the difference in sound they perceive
 with different finishes. I will pass that on to Tevis next time he comes in our store.  Perhaps if I can get my artificial embouchure working to perfection that can be used to remove the player variable to produce more accurate results.

I do believe the quality and type of metal can have a perceptible difference to the player, especially in the direct vibration that the player feels through his oral cavity and hands. I have two different horns
 with two necks that seem identical except the type of metal. In both cases the neck made with rose brass sounds darker than the one made with gold brass.

I know the scientific studies as well as you Toby.  However, there are a couple of observations that I might add to the mix.  

(1) None of the scientists including Benade, Coltman, or Neverdeen although good amateur players have/had a professional level of playing skill.

(2) The professional level players who discern a difference in the perceived sound and response with different finishes, etc. do so through bioacoustic feedback that would be impossible to measure or replicate in the laboratory. 

(3) There are still many unanswered questions in this area---especially where brass instruments are concerned where the effects of metals and/or finishes are much greater than in woodwinds.

The professional level players who discern a difference in the perceived
sound and response with different finishes, etc. do so through bioacoustic
feedback that would be impossible to measure or replicate in the laboratory.

            <pre class='message__body'>Not at all Keith.  Both statements are true and defensible in my view. They are also not incompatible. The makers and sellers should be the ones to step up to try to back up their claims (as Cannonball has already done in their "stones" patent).  However, there is a component which involves the perception to the player through:

-the top teeth, 
-the bony structure of the jaw and skull, 
-the eustachian tube, 
-the "upstream" vibrating air column felt by the sensitive tissues inside the mouth and throat

that cannot be duplicated or measured in the labratory.  My point is that there is are limits to what scientific testing and study can do in this area of acoustics.  That is not to say that they should not try to gain as much knowledge as possible.

 It puzzles me why those makers have not already done so especially when their representatives call out other manufacturers.

            <pre class='message__body'>Of course you are referring to me Chuck.  I am not presently, nor have I ever been employed by the Cannonball Musical Instrument Company.  I am not now, nor have I ever been a representative for their company or their line of saxophones.  This is a lie that was perpetuated on alt.music.sax by the owner of another saxophone company.  I would appreciate it if you would stop repeating that lie or alluding to it on public forums since that puts you in the same category as the individual who started the lie in the first place.  Thank you.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well as long as we are jumpstarted:

The fact that you know the scientific studies is what makes me wonder about your advancing these tired old arguments.

1. First, we need to explore what the difference between a "good amateur" and professional player might be. Even before we get there, it needs to be said that Fletcher is a concert-level flautist, and Joe Wolfe was a professional sax player before going to Cornell. But apparently in your mind as
 soon as one starts making money playing, a whole new sensory area of the brain opens up. Somehow I doubt this...

 If there is a perceivable difference--whether to amateur or professional--that difference is easily measurable with today&#39;s scientific instruments. Are you then advancing the argument that Joel Gilbert&#39;s paper is flawed, since he does not have the requisite skill on an musical instrument to
 record and interpret the data his scientific instruments collect? Apparently all the peer-reviewers were similarly fooled.

2. Are you aware of Smith&#39;s study of trombone bells? That not one of ten top professional trombonists who thought they could tell various bells apart could do so in double-blind testing, even though there were clearly measurable differences of up to 2 dB in their output at the position of the
 players&#39; ear. 2 dB is well within the threshold of perception, especially of professional, as opposed to "good amateur" players? Where does this leave your storied "bioacoustic" feedback?

3. I am certainly not arguing the case of brass instruments, with their, thin, and wide-flaring bells, from which all the sound energy issues all the time. But don&#39;t cloud the woodwind issue with apples and oranges comparisons. In this sense, saxes are clearly in the woodwind category, and Joel
 Gilbert&#39;s study should tell you all you need to know about that, especially about how much difference one as opposed to three as opposed to four layers of silver plating is going to affect the "vibrancy" of a thick metal tube which hardly vibrates to begin with.

In any case, these are all straw men. One significant question is this: Does the finish of the instrument extend into the bore, and if so, does it significantly affect either the bore dimensions or the bore smoothness. I don&#39;t have that much experience with different horns, but I have yet to see
 any instrument where the finish extends in the bore past the bell section. 

And of course, these questions completely deflect the focus from the core issue: What would happen to CBs claims if the bores of their various instruments were measured, and operationally identical horns in different finishes were tested in controlled, double-blind situations.

Seems to me that you&#39;d rather blindly believe your friends, instead of suffering the embarrassment of bringing up the hard questions with them.

 I know the scientific studies as well as you Toby.  However, there are a couple of observations that I might add to the mix.  
 
 (1) None of the scientists including Benade, Coltman, or Neverdeen although good amateur players have/had a professional level of playing skill.
 
 (2) The professional level players who discern a difference in the perceived sound and response with different finishes, etc. do so through bioacoustic feedback that would be impossible to measure or replicate in the laboratory. 
 
 (3) There are still many unanswered questions in this area---especially where brass instruments are concerned where the effects of metals and/or finishes are much greater than in woodwinds.

            <pre class='message__body'>The perception of sound through bone conduction is extremely poor, which is one reason that cochlear implants only work near the cochlea.

I did an interesting little informal experiment on my last airplane trip. I have a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones, and I noticed that if I touched an earcup to the airplane wall, the sound of the aircraft was quite vigorously transmitted to my ear by its vibration. Since the negative
 feedback of the acoustic circuit in the phones effectively brought ambient noise down by about 20 dB as perceived through the ears, I thought this might be a good time to find out about just how strong bone conduction really is. First I touched my chin to the wall, wearing headphones. There was a
 barely perceptible difference, probably around 2 dB more. Then I touched my top teeth to the wall and pressed about as hard as I would playing the sax (my seatmate was asleep, luckily). I was surprised to find that there was barely more conduction that way: probably a maximum of 3-4 dB. Touching
 my temple to the wall, though, was quite noticeble, something between 7-10 dB.

This informal experiment leads me to believe that "bone conduction" as a source of feedback in sax playing is way overstated by those grasping at straws to explain perceptual differences that are more cogently explained by observer bias.

And as I have already observed, CBs data to back up their claims about stones is garbage as presented.

 their "stones" patent).  However, there is a component which involves the perception to the player through:
 
 -the top teeth, 
 -the bony structure of the jaw and skull, 
 -the eustachian tube, 
 -the "upstream" vibrating air column felt by the sensitive tissues inside the mouth and throat
 
 that cannot be duplicated or measured in the labratory.  My point is that there is are limits to what scientific testing and study can do in this area of acoustics.  That is not to say that they should not try to gain as much knowledge as possible.

            <pre class='message__body'>For one thing, given the wide variation in tone color that any player can achieve with minimal embouchure variation, it would be very hard to establish a reliable baseline, and of course steady-state notes do not really tell you about response differences in transients.

Only an artificial embouchure would give repeatable results, and even those would require repeated trials to average out small differences in reed and/or "mouth" placement. Real scientists have to know a lot about statistics...

Further, as necks are quite complex geometrically, it would not be so easy to control for measurement variablilty, especially as different metals respond quite differently to various forming processes.

If those problems could be solved, though, good double blind testing using skilled (not necessarily professional) players would certainly be relatively easy to carry out and quite illuminating.

Of course such testing has already been done on a respectable level by Widholm with flutes, and the results led inescapably to the conclusion that materials were not significant in terms of contributing to the final sound. 

Realistically, makers who make claims to the contrary have nothing to gain and everything to lose by trying to verify their results scientifically, since not one experiment in the past 100 years has given anyone any reason to believe that materials or finishes affect woodwind response.

And makers, like politicians, know that if you repeat something enough, it becomes a truth in the minds of all but the most aware people. Aware people are not a large segment of the market...

 It puzzles me why those makers have not already done so especially when their representatives call out other manufacturers.

            <pre class='message__body'>Oh boy!  We haven&#39;t had a good argument for a long time Toby.  This
should be enlightening an illuminating.  I won&#39;t quote but will respond
by number to your numbered statements.

1.  The professional performer on a wind instrument who plays the same
instrument with the same "set up" every day of the week 4 to 6 hours per
day in practice, rehearsals, and performance develops an intimacy and
acute sensitivity to the way that instrument plays.  Minute changes to
that instrument are readily perceptible to that performer even though
the passive listener a few feet away can hear no difference whatever.

Your mentioning that I am saying that Gilbert&#39;s study is flawed is a
straw man argument to say the least.  Gilbert found that the wall
vibrations of thin walled oval tube can have a measurable effect upon
the sound produced under certain conditions.  Although his study is the
most comprehensive to date discounting the effects of wall vibrations in
woodwinds,  he does leave the door open slightly with this comment.

  "For real orchestral instruments, although the previously described
mechanism is not to be excluded completely for a particular instrument,
similar effects are thus unlikely to be measurable and, even if they
were, would only occur for one or a few notes.

2.  Smith&#39;s study is one of the least professional papers that I have
read.  There is a much greater body of research done by Whitehouse that
seems to contradict Smith&#39;s findings.   Smith&#39;s conclusions relative to
the skilled players he tested is nothing more than "anecdotal" since he
gives no actual statistical charts or data.

3.  Gilbert&#39;s study is excellent as far as it goes measuring the sound
from a thin walled brass tube generated by an artificially blown
clarinet mouthpiece.  My point is that no study,  including his can
accurately measure the perception to the highly skilled  player
intimately familiar with the make and model of instrument of different
variables including metals and finishes.

The glaring omission from Smith&#39;s trombone bell study and the
Widholm/Lidortner flute studies is the failure to ask each of the
players,  "When you played those two instruments side by side, did they
feel and sound the same or different"?  It is one thing to be able to
"pick" which one is the thin bell, or which one is the platinum flute
and an entirely different thing to recognize that each instrument had a
different feel, response, and aural feedback to the player.

As far as plating and anodized finishes being both inside and out the
saxophone body, I will need to do some more investigation to say for
certain on the Cannonball and Yamaha instruments I have the best access
to.  I do know from taking with techs who do a lot of plating that
successive layers of plating do in fact tend to fill in microscopic gaps
in the surface of the brass---especially copper plating. Whether this is
enough to create an acoustically different surface, I don&#39;t know. 
However, I am open to the possibility.

As far as my "friends" at Cannonball who play hundreds of saxes each
year of the identical model in different finishes, all I can say is that
"I believe that they believe that they perceive a difference in the tone
color".    Since I don&#39;t have that experience, nor do I play at that
level, I would hesitate to say they are imagining things or being
deliberately deceptive.

I also know that players on the level of Pete Christlieb, Branford
Marsalis, Gerald Albright, and the New Century Saxophone Quartet have
all gone to the Salt Lake City headquarters and spent hours playing
dozens of saxophones and necks in different finishes to select the
instrument that most efficiently produces the "sound" and "response"
that most closely matches their concept.

I have never felt comfortable in the camp of those who have the audacity
to say that those professional woodwind players who are some of the most
intelligent people in the world are "deluding themselves" into the false
impression that when they play two or more nearly identical instruments
in different finishes that they perceive a difference in the response
and tonal color.

I believe that there are aspects of the bioacoustic feedback loop that
are not yet well understood, especially when it comes to woodwinds. 
Anyone who has ever heard themselves on the playback of a good solo
recording knows that the sound the listener hears is markedly different
from the sound "heard" (and felt) by the performer.  I know that I tend
to flip flop and argue both sides of this question.  That simply means
that I don&#39;t have all the answers, and that I believe there is a lot
more to learn on this fascinating topic.

            <pre class='message__body'>I want to add the "experienced professional" to the mix - namely, myself.  Well, that would be "experienced ex-professional", as I no longer make my living by playing woodwinds.

I *believe* that material does not matter, but I can&#39;t prove it, even to myself.  There are too many other variables involved.  I offer this anecdote.

I went to a well known music store in the Bay Area, around 15-20 years ago, to try out a bunch of new Yanagisawa saxophones.  I was invited to do this by an old friend, Mel Martin, who endorses these instruments.  I tried 3 different tenor models, and about a half-dozen altos.  They all played a little differently, and some were much better than others. Then Mel said "Here, try the altos with this silver neck".  I did, and all the horns played much better (tone clarity and evenness, as well as ease of production). The difference was very noticeable both to me, as a player, and my wife as a listener (and Mel, as a both listener and player). 

The obvious conclusion is that the silver neck (it was solid silver) made the difference - yet I still *believe* that material makes no difference.  Why?  Because I have had similar experiences on my very nice Selmer SBA and Mark VI horns with different brass necks.

I *believe* that the shape and finish of the neck is critical to saxophone sound.  This is because I have played necks that play well on lots of different horns; the neck is the only thing that changes, and the horn plays better, or worse, depending.  

My suspicion is that the Yanagisawa techs put a lot of extra work into finishing those solid silver necks (they are expensive), and that is the source of the "better sound".  Can I back this up with hard scientific evidence?  No, but I think that my experience points pretty strongly in that direction.  And, it fits with what little I know about acoustics. So until some hard evidence comes along which directly contradicts my belief, I&#39;ll act as if it were true.

But I do place more respect on their attempts to produce some measurable data using scientific equipment than the anecdotal "all my friends who tried the neck said it plays better/darker/louder/brighter etc".

            <pre class='message__body'>"My point is that no study,  including his can accurately measure the
perception to the highly skilled  player intimately familiar with the
make and model of instrument of different variables including metals
and finishes."

This has been mentioned quite a few times, at least once, by every party here over the last months.  That would include references to A. Benade&#39;s statements regarding the player being aware of microscopic (0.0x mm) differences in dimensions of seemingly identical, mass produces instruments.  In reality, I&#39;m inclined to believe that any differences noticed by the player, as regards different wall materials in saxophones, are simply due to the resultant minute differences in air column dimensions and shape, those being the results of the manufacturer&#39;s method of forming metals of different tensile and yield strengths.  Drawn tone holes from a tube of brass will have a slightly different shape at the tube/chimney junction, than those of a tube of pure silver, or copper.  Plating and lacquering, and their preparatory buffing/cleaning steps change the thickness of tone hole wall material and round corners.

            <pre class='message__body'>"My suspicion is that the Yanagisawa techs put a lot of extra work into
finishing those solid silver necks (they are expensive), and that is
the source of the "better sound"." 

A reliable informed source (returned from Yanagisawa factory tour - they quote his review on their website) told me that their necks are hydro-extruded.  They use the same mold for both brass and silver necks, though the silver sheet stock is thinner than the brass.  That makes the inner bore of the silver necks slightly larger than that of the brass.

1.  The professional performer on a wind instrument who plays the same instrument with the same "set up" every day of the week 4 to 6 hours per day in practice, rehearsals, and performance develops an intimacy and acute sensitivity to the way that instrument plays.  Minute changes to that
 instrument are readily perceptible to that performer even though the passive listener a few feet away can hear no difference whatever.
---Logically, this doesn&#39;t butter the bread. There are all kinds of minute changes to consider, including differences in the ambient environment, differences in setup and physiological and psychological differences. You know very well, although you don&#39;t want to admit it, that in order to test for
 changes in a given parameter, ALL other significant variables must be controlled. Otherwise you have no basis on which to make a judgment about what is causing any perceived change.  Nor are we talking about the difference between perception of the player and listener. 

*****

Your mentioning that I am saying that Gilbert&#39;s study is flawed is a straw man argument to say the least.  Gilbert found that the wall vibrations of thin walled oval tube can have a measurable effect upon the sound produced under certain conditions.  Although his study is the most comprehensive to
 date discounting the effects of wall vibrations in woodwinds,  he does leave the door open slightly with this comment. 


 "For real orchestral instruments, although the previously described mechanism is not to be excluded completely for a particular instrument, similar effects are thus unlikely to be measurable and, even if they were, would only occur for one or a few notes.

---This is a VERY long way from saying that dipping the sax more than three times in the silver limits the vibrancy of the instrument. I can&#39;t believe that you are seriously advancing this as a defense of Cannonball&#39;s marketing BS, ESPECIALLY since we are talking about differences in coatings only
 a few micrometers thick applied upon an identical substrate at least 100x thicker.

*****


2.  Smith&#39;s study is one of the least professional papers that I have read.  There is a much greater body of research done by Whitehouse that seems to contradict Smith&#39;s findings.   Smith&#39;s conclusions relative to the skilled players he tested is nothing more than "anecdotal" since he gives no
 actual statistical charts or data.

---Hmmm, John doesn&#39;t like the short summary of the study which he read. Well, of course that means that all the peer reviewers must have been wrong.  Although it is a summary, he does state conclusively (and I have no reason to suspect that he is lying) that ten top trombonists, under
 double-blind conditions, could not perceive difference in tone color of up to 2dB at the position of the player&#39;s ear, differences that are within the normal range of perception. This is a rather unequivocal statement, and not anecdotal in the least.

*****

3.  Gilbert&#39;s study is excellent as far as it goes measuring the sound from a thin walled brass tube generated by an artificially blown clarinet mouthpiece.  My point is that no study,  including his can accurately measure the perception to the highly skilled  player intimately familiar with the
 make and model of instrument of different variables including metals and finishes.

---John, this is totally tangential to the argument and you know it. We are not talking about measuring perception, we are talking about measuring the physical phenomena upon which perception rests.  You argue round and round the point without ever touching it. Yet it is quite clear that physical
 phenomena can be measured, accurately and repeatably, whereas perceptive mechanisms are neither as accurate nor as controllable. Perceptive systems are synthetic in nature, processing varied inputs into an impression. There is no way to parse those input streams and test them separately  in an
 analytical way, which is exactly what we must do in order to know what varies and how much it varies in order to produce a given impression.

This is exactly why science was invented! And exactly why we are now able to manipulate physical reality in repeatable and predictable ways. 

In terms of the sensory system: go to this page and after viewing it for a while, tell me just how reliable your sensory perception is:

http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/

The order of the day here is clear: take your CB experts and let them repeat their superhuman feats of exquisite discrimination in controlled double-blind testing. Short of controlling all the variables known to ambush the best perceptive systems, you cannot rely on perceptions, no matter what
 mantle of authority the bearers of those perceptions might wear. 

*****

---The glaring omission from Smith&#39;s trombone bell study and the Widholm/Lidortner flute studies is the failure to ask each of the players,  "When you played those two instruments side by side, did they feel and sound the same or different"?  It is one thing to be able to "pick" which one is the
 thin bell, or which one is the platinum flute and an entirely different thing to recognize that each instrument had a different feel, response, and aural feedback to the player.

First, the Smith study showed that there was NO PERCEIVABLE DIFFERENCE between the trombones with different bells. How could those pro trombonists comment on how the different instruments felt if they could not tell them apart?

And again, this is a logical fallacy. We are not talking about secondary material effects, but primary ones, to wit: does the material affect the SOUND, not does the material affect the player&#39;s perception of the sound. I would have not a complaint if CB marketing said that dipping the sax three
 times in silver gave the player the FEELING of vibrancy in the horn (whatever "vibrancy" is...more doctors recommend....), or that it looks totally cool, or that it feels wonderful to the touch. What burns my ass is that CB is making totally unsubstantiated claims about the primary effects of the
 finishes. Even you, in your state of denial, should be able to recognize this. Yes, I know, cognitive dissonance is a tough thing...

*****

As far as plating and anodized finishes being both inside and out the saxophone body, I will need to do some more investigation to say for certain on the Cannonball and Yamaha instruments I have the best access to.  I do know from taking with techs who do a lot of plating that successive layers of
 plating do in fact tend to fill in microscopic gaps in the surface of the brass---especially copper plating. Whether this is enough to create an acoustically different surface, I don&#39;t know.  However, I am open to the possibility.

---I am also open to this possibility. However I predict that the differences in inner smoothness between different finishes would be negligible. This also would be quite easy to test in a double-blind situation.

*****

As far as my "friends" at Cannonball who play hundreds of saxes each year of the identical model in different finishes, all I can say is that "I believe that they believe that they perceive a difference in the tone color".    Since I don&#39;t have that experience, nor do I play at that level, I would
 hesitate to say they are imagining things or being deliberately deceptive.  

---That is the kind of honest statement that should be in their advertising: "We play hundreds of saxes in different finishes each year, and we perceive a consistent difference between them."  Or, "Our experience here at Cannonball is that..." However, this is a far cry from their actual copy. 

I&#39;m not singling out CB in this regard; almost all makers except Buescher in the old days do the same thing. I expect nothing less in terms of current marketing practices in our society. However I will not allow such unfounded claims to go unchallenged on a forum such as this one, which hopefully
 is about unbiased information and penetrating the prevailing climate of BS.

I also know that players on the level of Pete Christlieb, Branford Marsalis, Gerald Albright, and the New Century Saxophone Quartet have all gone to the Salt Lake City headquarters and spent hours playing dozens of saxophones and necks in different finishes to select the instrument that most
 efficiently produces the "sound" and "response" that most closely matches their concept.

---More examples of the same fallacy do not a truth make as regards the primary effects of materials. Anyway, those folks are choosing horns, not finishes. I have sometimes played tens of flutes, plated, silver and gold, in order to find the one that most efficiently produces the "sound" and
 "response" that I most like. I then rank those flutes by how they play, not based on what they are made of.

*****

I have never felt comfortable in the camp of those who have the audacity to say that those professional woodwind players who are some of the most intelligent people in the world are "deluding themselves" into the false impression that when they play two or more nearly identical instruments in
 different finishes that they perceive a difference in the response and tonal color.

---The very fact that you use the word "audacity" accurately reflects your bias in that regard. Yes, I know your position very well, and it has not changed since the first day on SOTW that you wondered how I dared tell you what you were perceiving. But you seem to be missing some fundamental
 points, which are well summed up by Coltman&#39;s comments on his experiment in his response to a doubter:

"First, we need to be clear about the question. Mather&#39;s question is: &#39;Should we concluded that the differences in tone quality noted by generations of manufacturers, players and listeners are purely imaginary?&#39;. My answer to this is: certainly not. No one contends that a wooden baroque flute
 sound like a silver Boehm flute. The question is: is it due to the material? To find the root causes is not easy. Mr. Mather&#39;s article does a good job of pointing out a number of causes for tone variation, the possibility of interactions between these causes, and the difficulties of sorting them
 out. I disagree, however, with his final conclusion: &#39;No better way seems to be presently available than to poll the experiences of many flutists playing many instruments under many circumstances. Then the characteristic influences of each material or thickness can be recognized and they do
 indeed exist.&#39;

The last four words raise immediate suspicion as to the impartiality of the poll-taker. But more important, this method has obviously not succeeded in the past.  The literature abounds with statements, made by scholarly, experienced men, that take quite opposing positions. The reason it two fold.
 First, the player and experimenter rarely, if ever, have any way of knowing whether the instruments they are comparing have differences other than those of the material, in fact I know of no reports in which the claim for &#39;no other variation&#39; is made. Second, the musician cannot, under normal
 circumstances, dissociate his personal preferences and prejudices from the question at hand. In the case of the three &#39;flute&#39; I constructed, nearly every player who picked them up and tried them had a preference for one or the other. Often he would describe his impressions - the wooden flute has
 a &#39;fuller&#39; tone, the silver one &#39;projects&#39; much better, etc. He was then usually baffled to find that he could not identify any of the instruments under the &#39;blindfold&#39; conditions I described. The plain facts are that his judgment is influenced by preconceived notions and mental associations of
 tone quality with other properties of the material. This is a normal human reaction, intensified in those trained to incorporate feeling into their art, and to whom the instrument becomes, in effect, an extension of their own body and personality. I do not belittle this attitude;  it is,  I
 believe, a desirable condition for the achievement of the fullest artistic expression. It is just not suited for answering narrow, objective questions like the one I posed -  namely: can the material of which a flute is made directly influence the tone quality produced?"

*****

I believe that there are aspects of the bioacoustic feedback loop that are not yet well understood, especially when it comes to woodwinds.  Anyone who has ever heard themselves on the playback of a good solo recording knows that the sound the listener hears is markedly different from the sound
 "heard" (and felt) by the performer.  I know that I tend to flip flop and argue both sides of this question.  That simply means that I don&#39;t have all the answers, and that I believe there is a lot more to learn on this fascinating topic.

---Again, the bioacoustic feedback loop is not germane to the question at hand (and the claims made by CB and others) as regards the primary effect of wall material on tone color and/or response.

            <pre class='message__body'>Speaking logically, since scientific evidence shows that very small dimensional differences can affect the final sound (and the mechanisms for this are known), and there is no scientific evidence that materials in the thicknesses used in necks have any effect on sound (and no mechanism is known by
 which this might be possible), it is reasonable to conclude that it is the dimensions and not the material causing the difference.

It would, of course, be interesting to hydroform some brass necks of the same thickness stock as the silver (or vice-versa), measure them carefully to exclude significant differences in dimension or smoothness, and then test again players&#39; experiences both in open and double-blind situations.

Wall Vibration Study
&lt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/20370wn01t56544j/fulltext.pdf>


This study leaves me with the question that:

If for lip reed instruments the primary source of wall vibration is the
player&#39;s lips, then for the saxophone is the reed the primary source for
wall vibrations as well.

The corollary question is that:

If the interaction between the brass player&#39;s lips and the wall
vibration can change the timbre of the sound, then would it be possible
to have that same effect occur on the saxophone with the interaction
between the wall vibrations, the reed, and the player&#39;s single lip?

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,

Nothing new in that study. It does appear that there are significant vibrations caused by the beating of the reed against the mpc, and if you remember Nederveen even postulates that vibrations of the neck caused by the beating reed might affect the player&#39;s embouchure and possibly cause a maximum
 of 3 dB difference from what it would be in the absence of such vibrations.

However it is important to remember that the vibrational differences between different materials is small compared to "no vibration at all", so it would not be anywhere near 3 dB. 

Note also that in this study the main cause of vibration was the brass bell. We all know that brass bells, being wide and flared as they are, relatively thin and the only exit for all the sound power of the instrument (which is considerably stronger than that of any woodwind, by an order of
 magnitude or so (at least in the case of trombone)), are going to have a significant effect on the sound. 

There is no significant vibration in the puny flare of the sax bell, which only really comes into play anyway in the bottom couple of bell notes.

You should also note that the brass bell can actually couple and resonate at playing frequencies (one of the three conditions expressed in that paper), whereas this does not happen in the sax at all. This is an important, actually vital, condition to having enough vibration to affect anything.

Please also remember that in the Gilbert study, the beating reed did not seem to create any vibrations that materially affected the sound, and even when the resonances of the tube were brought into "ovalling" range by making it elliptical, those quite large vibrations only affected a few notes.

Extrapolating from all this data, it seems reasonable to conclude that even if the beating reed does introduce some vibration, it would be insignificant, or at worst it would have a very slight effect on a few notes. Gilbert calls even this "unlikely" in normal musical instruments, although it
 might have some effect in large and thin organ pipes.

Wall Vibration Study 


This study leaves me with the question that:

If for lip reed instruments the primary source of wall vibration is the player&#39;s lips, then for the saxophone is the reed the primary source for wall vibrations as well.  

The corollary question is that:

If the interaction between the brass player&#39;s lips and the wall vibration can change the timbre of the sound, then would it be possible to have that same effect occur on the saxophone with the interaction between the wall vibrations, the reed, and the player&#39;s single lip?

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby,

In particular, I would like to call your attention to this statement
from page 2 of the study.

Moore et al. (2005) has concluded that the most likely reason for the
wall vibrations having an effect is mechanical feedback of vibrations
from the bell to the players&#39; lips through the walls. The
players&#39; lip movements are then affected which then affects the
power spectrum. They also propose that slight changes in the input
impedance at higher frequencies are due to changes in the viscous
boundary layer, which increases with vibration magnitude; they postulate
that it is a combination of both of these two effects. There are three
couplings relevant for transfer of vibrations: (1) between the internal
air and the walls, (2) between the walls and the external air, and (3)
between the players&#39; lips and the walls.

I would also like to clarify my premise in this discussion.  That is
that believe that the wall vibrations of thin walled woodwinds (flutes
and saxophones) may effect the  perception of the highly skilled
performer.  I believe this to be a possibility even though the
measurable effects of the wall vibrations directly affecting the emitted
sound are negligible.

It is also well known that skilled players can alter the timbre of the
sound at will using the embouchure, air stream, and oral cavity.  I
believe it entirely possible that the different  bioacoustic feedback to
the player from a raw brass or plated instrument as opposed to a
lacquered one could affect how they interact with the instrument
resulting in a difference in tone.

Lastly, there is the "self-fulfilling prophecy" aspect which would mean
that a trumpet player who believes silver plated instruments sound
brighter and brassier  will unconsciously play with a brighter and
brassier tone when he plays one.  The question then becomes
philosophical rather than scientific.  Did the silver finish trumpet
sound brighter and brassier in this instance?  Certainly it did?  Did
the finish affect the sound?  Absolutely.  Did the player deliberately
deceive himself or his listeners (BS as some call it)?  I don&#39;t think
so, if the player honestly believed that the finish affects the sound.

One simply cannot remove the human element in these discussions and talk
about the physics and acoustics of wind instruments in a vacuum because
the interaction between the human being and the instrument is an
integral  part of the finished product that the listener hears.

John &lt;jtalcott47@...> wrote:                                              Toby,

In particular, I would like to call your attention to this statement from page 2 of the study.


Moore et al. (2005) has concluded that the most likely reason for the wall vibrations having an effect is mechanical feedback of vibrations from the bell to the players&#39; lips through the walls. The players&#39; lip movements are then affected which then affects the power spectrum. They also propose
 that slight changes in the input impedance at higher frequencies are due to changes in the viscous boundary layer, which increases with vibration magnitude; they postulate that it is a combination of both of these two effects. There are three couplings relevant for transfer of vibrations: (1)
 between the internal air and the walls, (2) between the walls and the external air, and (3) between the players&#39; lips and the walls.

----Is it not correct that the main mechanism being discussed here is powered by bell vibrations traveling back through the tube? This would not, at the best of times, exist at anywhere near the same magnitude in woodwinds, as I pointed out.

I would also like to clarify my premise in this discussion.  That is that believe that the wall vibrations of thin walled woodwinds (flutes and saxophones) may effect the  perception of the highly skilled performer.  I believe this to be a possibility even though the measurable effects of the wall
 vibrations directly affecting the emitted sound are negligible.

It is also well known that skilled players can alter the timbre of the sound at will using the embouchure, air stream, and oral cavity.  I believe it entirely possible that the different  bioacoustic feedback to the player from a raw brass or plated instrument as opposed to a lacquered one could
 affect how they interact with the instrument resulting in a difference in tone.

---Again, it would be very easy to do a double-blind experiment to test this premise.  Take four or five saxes that are shown to play and sound very similar, to the point that they cannot be told apart by players in the dark.  Now lacquer up all but one, cover parts that touch the skin, and run
 the test in the dark again. 

---Further, it is clear that how a player feels about an instrument is going to change the final sound. Recently in another forum I mentioned an experiment, and it bears repeating here. A number of test subjects were given two different wines to drink while being hooked up to an fMRI real-time
 brain scan. The point was to see how their reported sensations matched with actual activity in their brains. First they were given an ordinary red table wine to drink, then after a rare and costly vintage wine. All the subjects reported enjoying the expensive wine more, and the fMRI showed
 increased activity in the pleasure centers of their brains. Not only did they "think" they were enjoying the good wine more, they were actually physiologically experiencing more pleasure in drinking it.

---Of course the second point of this experiment was hidden from the test subjects, and that involved the fact that the wines were exactly the same, only presented differently.

--Again, I have nothing against people enjoying themselves, and if they enjoy one finish over another and play accordingly that is totally fine with me. But I resent the falsehoods in advertising that trigger the preferences. Everybody does it, but I find it unethical.

---The effect of material that you are speaking of, that of perception, is a secondary effect. There are plenty of secondary effects of this type, and no one in their right mind would deny the significance of secondary effects on the sound. However this is neither what we are speaking about, nor
 what CB is presenting in their copy.

Lastly, there is the "self-fulfilling prophecy" aspect which would mean that a trumpet player who believes silver plated instruments sound brighter and brassier  will unconsciously play with a brighter and brassier tone when he plays one.  The question then becomes philosophical rather than
 scientific.  Did the silver finish trumpet sound brighter and brassier in this instance?  Certainly it did?  Did the finish affect the sound?  Absolutely.  Did the player deliberately deceive himself or his listeners (BS as some call it)?  I don&#39;t think so, if the player honestly believed that
 the finish affects the sound.

---There is a zen parable about two disciples watching a flag waving in the breeze and arguing about whether the flag is moving or the air is moving. They ask their master, who says, "Neither. Mind is moving."

---So,  if I sell amulets to protect you from the evil eye, and that makes you feel safer, is that OK in your view? If I sell snake oil to cure your ills, and after drinking it you feel better because you believe it will make you feel better, it is OK to claim it is scientifically proven to cure
 your ills?

One simply cannot remove the human element in these discussions and talk about the physics and acoustics of wind instruments in a vacuum because the interaction between the human being and the instrument is an integral  part of the finished product that the listener hears.   

---In an overall sense this is certainly true, but there is an ethical issue in claiming that something does something physically or acoustically when it does not.
