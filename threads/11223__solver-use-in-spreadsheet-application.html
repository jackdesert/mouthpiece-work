            <pre class='message__body'>I am using the "Mouthpiece Facing Curve Analysis" (credited to Mojo & A. Donaldson) in Neo Office, and I want to start using the solver to calculate best fit curves. I believe it works very similar to Excel, so I hope that will not be a complicating issue.

Is there anyone willing to walk me through it?

This is where I&#39;m at:

1) I set the Error Sum cell as the "Target Cell" and check on "minimum."

2) Where it says "By changing cells" I think I need to highlight cell "Elliptical Radius."

When I try this, I get "Err:502" in many of the "Calculated Curve Fit" and "Diff" columns, which I believe means I&#39;m getting multiple possible solutions.

3) Then there are the "Limiting Conditions." I&#39;m guessing I use these limits to get only one solution?

Thanks in advance for any help!

There are 3 paramaters that need to be solved to get an ellipse of best fit for a set of data.  It depends on how the sheet is set up as to which 3 parameters these are.
 
I went looking for the spreadsheet you are trying to use but I could not find one with an error sum cell in it.  What is the file name and where is it located?

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s the "Facing Curve Worksheet." I believe I got it from the Yahoo Workgroup Files, but I&#39;m having trouble finding it again, so maybe I got it elsewhere.

I&#39;ll e-mail it to you so we can be sure to be on the same page.

So far I have just been playing with the Elliptical Radius and the Curve Start numbers to get the best match and thus minimize the error sum. I&#39;m guessing this is what the solver does, (only better!)

When I try to do this I get an error message saying "The model is not linear."

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>After a little more playing around and research I think I understand my problem and figured I would post it here in case it helps anyone else.

I downloaded a free trial of Excel and after adding on the solver feature it worked exactly like it is supposed to. While doing this I realized there are different solver settings in the Excel version, including the "GRG Non-linear" solver, which is the one to use for this type of equation.

I am trying to find a free spreadsheet program that can do this, but (as far as I know) google docs and NeoOffice don&#39;t have non-linear solver features.

OpenOffice (free open-source software) has an extension (add-on) called Solvit which apparently has a non-linear equation solver (some details at http://extensions.openoffice.org/en/node/4659 ) Although I haven&#39;t been able to get it to solve for facing curves.

Is there anyone here that has gotten OpenOffice Solvit to work solving facing curves? It would be great to have a free working solution for this.

In the meantime I&#39;ll be using the one month free demo version of MS Office.

Thanks in advance for any help!

            <pre class='message__body'>It is possible to set up a spreadsheet for iterative calculations.  I used to do it decades ago before built-in solvers were available.  It is a lot more involved and more things can go wrong.

I would suggest surfing eBay and look for some deals on MS Office.   I use a 2003 version still.  Some are there under $50.

            <pre class='message__body'>It is easy to throw out a point you do not want to include in your fit.  Just delete the diff^2 calculation in the cell for that point.
 
The fit is a way to study a curve.  But how you determine a target curve can be very different.
