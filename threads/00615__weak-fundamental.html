            <pre class='message__body'>Doing some research I have found this which opens the door a bit to
understanding this phenomenon.  From UNSW acoustics website.

For frequencies above about several hundred hertz, the resonances become
weaker with increasing frequency. This is due to the &#39;friction&#39; of the
moving air against the inside of the instrument (technically, the
viscous and to a smaller extent thermal losses in the boundary layer).
This affects higher frequencies more than low.

However, a problem faced by the conical instruments but not by
cylindrical instruments is that the first resonance is weak. We saw
above under cut-off frequency that, at low frequencies, it is easier to
move the air backwards and forwards, because less acceleration is
involved. This means that the impedance of the &#39;air at the downstream
end of the instrument&#39; (technically the radiation impedance at the end)
is low for low frequencies. Further, the cone is good at matching the
low impedance of the large end to the high impedance at the small end.
Together, these effects make the lowest resonance of conical instruments
weaker than those of their cylindrical cousins. That is why the whole
curve turns down to lower values at low frequency. (Compare with curves
for the clarinet.)
