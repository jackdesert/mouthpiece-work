            <pre class='message__body'>I recently bought this Mpce. I also bought a 50&#39;s Conn Nkd Lady bari 
in great shape. I&#39;ve been messing with Bari&#39;s for the last few years. 
I want to keep this one and incorporate it into our band. I bought a 
cheap Rico mpce.,B7. Tip opening is around .090". I don&#39;t get the 
response I&#39;m looking for with this mpce and want to use a more open 
tip. 
I currently play a Tenor with a Van Doren S, #9 with a tip opening 
of .110". This used Van Doren BAri mpce I bought off of Ebay needs a 
lot of work. These are the readings:
.001 - around .075"
.010 - 66
.015 - 48
.020 - 41
.024 - 39
.035 - 27
.050 - 18
.063 - 10
.078 - guessing .075", only makes it half way over the tip, not right 
to the corners.(I will get more accurate with the tip measurment when 
I start working on this pce and I don&#39;t know who makes the glass 
gauge I&#39;m using. It&#39;s the generic looking thin type and I&#39;m reading 
each line as increments of 2 (mm?))
These are median readings, left and right rails are uneven. This 
facing is way too long. I took these readings after flattening the 
table.  My tenor mpce opening is comfortable. I use #2 van Doren 
reeds. I like this strength but because I&#39;ve never gotten serious 
about playing a bari I don&#39;t know if I should try and duplicate this 
setup with a bari mpce. I don&#39;t have another mpce besides the 2 
mentioned. I realize that I can&#39;t open a mpce more than the mat&#39;l 
left at the mpce tip will allow me. 
So --- How much can I open the tip on this mpce?
(I can go to a harder reed but I like the opening I have with my 
tenor mpce)
   --- How would I approach this scenerio? 
   --- Is there some place on this site where a list of target 
measurements are that I can go for to make this a consistent, and 
even radial curve? ( I don&#39;t have the Excel problem solver software 
setup).
Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Get a simple ruler with a mm scale and hold it next to your glass gage. 
Try to figure out if the scale is in direct mm, or 1/2 mm per line
division.  Watch your decimal points.  Id you have a .001" feeler that
reads 75 on the your glass gage, do not call it .075".

Do you have a gage that measures tip openings like a set of digital
calipers?  Can you measure how thick the tip material is now.  This would
give a rough indication of how much farther you could go before the tip
runs out of material and gets sharp (pointy).  You will be able to go a
little farther if you trim back the tip but now the MP starts to become
distorted more and more.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Keith.
The scale of the glass gage, relative to the numbers stencilled on the gage, are 1/2 mm&#39;s. The actual lines are 1mm apart.  I goofed with the .001 reading, the facing length, thanks for pointing that out. I&#39;m still a bit fuzzy from pain killers after knee surgery. The reading for the .001 feeler gage is 66 or 33mm which would be my facing length. 

The .010" gage is incorrect, it reads 50 on the gage, the rest of the readings are correct. The tip opening is around .075". I do have the calipers and micrometers to do a more exact reading.

Any suggestions as to how much I can open this mpce tip, how long the facing should be and target readings for a radial curve?

Thanks again for your help.

  Thanks Keith.
  The scale of the glass gage, relative to the numbers stencilled on the gage, are 1/2 mm&#39;s. The actual lines are 1mm apart.  I goofed with the .001 reading, the facing length, thanks for pointing that out. I&#39;m still a bit fuzzy from pain killers after knee surgery. The reading for the .001 feeler gage is 66 or 33mm which would be my facing length. 

  The .010" gage is incorrect, it reads 50 on the gage, the rest of the readings are correct. The tip opening is around .075". I do have the calipers and micrometers to do a more exact reading.

  Any suggestions as to how much I can open this mpce tip, how long the facing should be and target readings for a radial curve?

  Thanks again for your help.

    Get a simple ruler with a mm scale and hold it next to your glass gage. 
    Try to figure out if the scale is in direct mm, or 1/2 mm per line
    division. Watch your decimal points. Id you have a .001" feeler that
    reads 75 on the your glass gage, do not call it .075".

      Thanks Keith.
  The scale of the glass gage, relative to the numbers stencilled on the gage, are 1/2 mm&#39;s. The actual lines are 1mm apart.  I goofed with the .001 reading, the facing length, thanks for pointing that out. I&#39;m still a bit fuzzy from pain killers after knee surgery. The reading for the .001 feeler gage is 66 or 33mm which would be my facing length. 
   
  The .010" gage is incorrect, it reads 50 on the gage, the rest of the readings are correct. The tip opening is around .075". I do have the calipers and micrometers to do a more exact reading.
   
  Any suggestions as to how much I can open this mpce tip, how long the facing should be and target readings for a radial curve?
   
  Thanks again for your help.

Get a simple ruler with a mm scale and hold it next to your glass gage. 
Try to figure out if the scale is in direct mm, or 1/2 mm per line
division. Watch your decimal points. Id you have a .001" feeler that
reads 75 on the your glass gage, do not call it .075".

Do you have a gage that measures tip openings like a set of digital
calipers? Can you measure how thick the tip material is now. This would
give a rough indication of how much farther you could go before the tip
runs out of material and gets sharp (pointy). You will be able to go a
little farther if you trim back the tip but now the MP starts to become
distorted more and more.

I put a a new file in the Files - Bari Sax section:

Bari Facing Curve - message 5939

It has an analysis tab and a target tab.

Some of the original facing readings from message 5939 and 5941 do 
not make sense when plotted.  .010"P and .015"H are too close 
together.  

The current facing length at ~66 is too long.  Once you close this 
down to ~50-53, there may not be enough material for you to easily 
get these targets for a .110" tip opening.  You can try angling the 
table and filing back the tip, but these can be challenging 
techniques to master.

 Obviously there is a flat spot on my gragh. I double checked these to make sure.

Thanks again Keith. I&#39;m going to mess with a couple of alto mpces relative to angling the table. I&#39;ve tried one in the past and your right of course, this is no easy task. I never did finish it. It got very difficult to make the table even. And then there is the facing curve... Oh well, it&#39;s the adventure...

  You can try these for targets.

  F [inch]L L [mm]
  0.001 53.0 26.5
  0.005 46.3 23.1
  0.010 41.2 20.6
  0.015 37.3 18.7
  0.020 34.1 17.0
  0.024 31.8 15.9
  0.035 26.2 13.1
  0.050 20.0 10.0
  0.063 15.3 7.6
  0.078 10.4 5.2
  0.093 6.0 3.0
  Tip 0.110 1.5 0.8

  I put a a new file in the Files - Bari Sax section:

  Bari Facing Curve - message 5939

  It has an analysis tab and a target tab.

  Some of the original facing readings from message 5939 and 5941 do 
  not make sense when plotted. .010"P and .015"H are too close 
  together. 

  The current facing length at ~66 is too long. Once you close this 
  down to ~50-53, there may not be enough material for you to easily 
  get these targets for a .110" tip opening. You can try angling the 
  table and filing back the tip, but these can be challenging 
  techniques to master.

Take a look at the file Facing Schedule.zip in the Methods folder in 
the Files area.  You do not need Excel to generate schedules for 
radial curves.  The spreadsheet works with OpenOffice Calc and 
Gnumeric, both free.  I also include a procedure to generate an 
accurate curve without the Solver add-in.  All you need is the facing 
length and the tip opening and you can generate a radial curve target 
schedule.

For a bari, I usually use either a 27mm or 28mm (0.0015" feeler) 
facing length.  If you are using a .110" opening on a tenor, you most 
likely would be comfortable with something in that range in a bari 
and probably a little more open.  Going from something with a 0.080" 
opening to 0.110" would be a bit of a stretch, but as was mentioned 
here, it depends on how much material you have at the tip before it 
gets too thin and sharp.

Rico Royal Graftonite mouthpieces are kind of fun to experiment with--
and cheap.  My favorite mouthpiece was a Yamaha 5C on my vintage 1923 
Buescher bari--until I hogged out a Graftonite mouthpiece. It took a 
while, but I took out the high baffle and  hogged out the sides.  Not 
quite a vintage pickle mouthpiece, but it has a pretty big chamber 
now.

Good luck with modifying your bari mouthpiece.
