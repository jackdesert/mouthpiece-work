Steve, Im new to this and Paul C. informed me I need one of these

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s used to measure the tip opening of mouthpieces. It does use a dial
indicator that I purchase from Harbor Freight, but that&#39;s all. The rest of
the tool I make. It&#39;s $29.00 for members of this group, shipped within the
US. That is going to change to $40.00 plus shipping really soon, though. So
I suggest you order now.
 
All the best,

Does it mount on to the mouthpiece, and what is the

Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>It doesn&#39;t mount on the mouthpiece, you set the mouthpiece against the stop
on the plate, and read the tip opening on the gauge. Theoretically you could
measure a tip opening up to 1.00", but I really don&#39;t think that will be
necessary. I have left the stop on the plate about 1/2" high so you can
measure basically any opening you want with ease. You can adjust how much of
the gauge is exposed by a collar on the gauge shaft that has a set screw.

I&#39;ll post a picture with instructions later this weekend. I have enough
material at this point for about 35 units. 

Later,

Steve
