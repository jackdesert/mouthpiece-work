            <pre class='message__body'>I am playing a very nicely modified lazer guardala studio on a MKVI. I 
am curious why the intonation on the guardala is so good, while a 
really fine sounding STM Link which is flat in first octave and that is 
10cents or more sharp on the palm keys, especially D. I literally lock 
in on the guardala but not on the link. Is there is anything that can 
be done on the link to improve its pitch? thanks in advance.

            <pre class='message__body'>The Link&#39;s chamber is too large.  You have to push it on quite a way to play up to pitch in the low register.  Then the palm keys are very sharp.  All symptoms of too large chamber.
   
  I fix Links by filling in the hollowed out side walls and some of the roof of the mouthpiece.  I literally make a new chamber.  It then has a good focus, a little brighter tone, and better intonation.

Thanks for the reply.  Do you put material on the floor of the chamber or simply the roof and walls?

  The Link&#39;s chamber is too large.  You have to push it on quite a way to play up to pitch in the low register.  Then the palm keys are very sharp.  All symptoms of too large chamber.
