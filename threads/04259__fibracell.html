            <pre class='message__body'>Hi there,

I thought I&#39;d give you all a tiny bit of info regarding the Fibracell reeds.

I use them for tenor and bari.  I love them.  However.....I&#39;ve had to return 3 to the manufacturer because after playing on them for a few hours, the lay of the reed starts to peel off.  Yup, that&#39;s right.

I&#39;ve exchanged numerous emails with the Fibracell manufacturers and what I&#39;ve ended up with....it&#39;s not a manufacturing or product default.....but my fault!  They made me wrong so they could be right.

They say, after I get done playing, wipe the reed off and dry the mpc, then replace the reed on the mpc is what&#39;s causing the reed to peel.....so my question to all of you is....?

Have any of you had that problem?

Thanks for your time,

A few years ago I had a few Fibracells that failed this way -  the bottom
membrane separated from the reed at the very tip. Fortunately, it never
happened at a gig - the reed suddenly becomes virtually unplayable.

But I haven&#39;t had this problem since then. Either you got a bad batch, an
old batch, or the problem is recurring - they have changed their reeds
lately; the color is different, the fiber is described as "new, improved",
and the reeds seem slightly less bright-sounding (I find I can remedy this
however using Ridenour&#39;s sanding block).

            <pre class='message__body'>In the past, I have modified a few Fibracells.  It does not work well. 
Instead I buy several of each strength from different lots (months apart)
and I grade them to 1/4 strengths.

To "clip" them, I used a stainless steel mouthpiece as a fixture and
overhung the Fibracell past the tip.  I then bent the tip of the reed over
and sanded it off against the tip rail of the mouthpiece.  I have only done
this twice but it worked well enough to get 6 months out of each reed.

I have scraped and sanded the vamps.  This raises small fibers that
irritate your bottom lip until they are worn off.  Wisking the reed over a
flame can curl the fibers up so they wear off easier.   It works, but not
well.

You can "drill" Fibracells too.  This works decent but I&#39;ve only tried it
once.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi there,

Well....it was simply a no-win situation for me to get through to the folks at Fibracell.....

All that I said was exactly what I do....i.e., take the reed off, wipe it dry, dry the mpc, put the reed back on, and that&#39;s it.

To make me wrong....Fibracell said....."oh no, you&#39;ve got to put the reed back into the little plastic case...that&#39;s why the reed started to peel....."

Peter....if I had told them that....when I&#39;m done playing, I take the reed off and wipe it dry, then put it into the little plastic case....they would&#39;ve said...."oh no....once you&#39;ve dried the reed off, you need to put it back on the mpc."  So you see, they were completely closed to the fact that the reeds have a serious manufacturing defect....upgrades and improvements notwithstanding.

Get it?  This is after returning 2 tenor and 1 bari reed, which they replaced on their good side.  But, it is a problem.

I do play a metal mouthpiece, which I mentioned, but that didn&#39;t matter.  So....go know?

Still love the reeds, but at $12-15 a pop, I&#39;ve started to use the bari reeds, which are a bit brighter, but I don&#39;t have to worry about the cessation of sound in the middle of a solo.

Thanks for asking,

Cheers,

Fred Gruenebaum

The last 2 times I ordered Fibracells from wwbw.com, the reeds were
back-ordered and it took weeks for the order to be filled.

Better service is obtainable from the late Charlie A&#39;s website, whose widow
now runs the business.  &lt; http://www.gigdust.com > They ship promptly,
reasonable prices.

They&#39;re also available from 
http://www.junkdude.com/saxes/fibracellreeds.htm,
shipping is only $1.50, though I&#39;ve never ordered from dave so I 
don&#39;t know what the service is like.

            <pre class='message__body'>I usually use a 2.5 Fibracell on sax.  Sometimes a 3 or an older MS or M.
 
The 3 has a darker sound and is easier to get high altissimo on.  The 2.5 is more vibrant to my tastes and it picks up a little edge.  A 2 is downright buzzy which some players hear in the 2.5 and harder Fibracells.
 
I can get an octave of altissimo out of them fairly easily (up to G4).  I can eek out a C5 most of the time.  It is part of my play testing to try it.  If the G4 does not respond, I adjust the tip rail to help.  I usually let the C5 go unless the client specifically states they use a lot of altissimo.  I think a good cane reed is needed to play above G4.  So if I get C5 with a Fibracell, a cane reed should be even better.
