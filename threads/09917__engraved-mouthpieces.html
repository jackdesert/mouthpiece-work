            <pre class='message__body'>We are considering offering hand engraved mouthpieces to our  
customers.....seems to me that more bling is needed......any interest?  
I have been in touch with master engraver Jason Dumars about providing  
this service.....Jason has engraved some of my personal instruments  
for me and his work is simply the best in the world.....we think some  
of our clients might appreciate it if this service were  
available....let me know your thoughts

            <pre class='message__body'>Sounds interesting.  I was looking @ Ivan Myers website, and his work 
looks good.  Might be nice to see a low rider dressed up!
