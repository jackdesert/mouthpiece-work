when one starts to play the reed feels great ,

low notes needs brute force to attack.

MPC and reed , right up to the ligature.

> Hi Keith and all,
>
> I went and had a look at all my mpcs re: table flatness. Another way to
judge this that I like is to lightly moisten the table and hold it flat up
underneath a (flat) piece of glass. It&#39;s then easy to see where the talbe
makes contact and where it doesn&#39;t, but bear in mind that the thickness of
the moisture layer can fill in slight irregularities.
>
> One perfect way to judge concavity is to give the table a couple of swipes
across some 2000 grit sandpaper pressed against a hard, flat surface and see
where the shine comes up. By that light almost all my metal pieces had a
slight concavity. But judging by the basic unevenness of the tables in
question (Beechler alto, Berg Larsen tenor, Brilhart bari) my guess is that
this is a bit of "insurance" for the mass makers to ensure that their sloppy
finishing doesn&#39;t include a high spot in the center, though I don&#39;t really
know for sure.
>
> On the other hand the hard rubber pieces I have all had reasonably flat
tables without any convexity (with the exception of an ancinet Berg Larsen
sop, which has a slight concavity). These range from some cheapies like a
Rico and a Lakey to my venerable and beloved MC Gregory. Probably much
easier to machine the softer material reasonably well
>
> The argument to hollow out a table so that the reed can swell into it
doesn&#39;t make sense to me. It seems to me that if the fibers are going to
swell they will swell equally, not just in the center in such a way as to
lift the edges up and create problems. I&#39;ve never had a problem with any of
the pieces whose tables I have flattened.
>
> As I say I think that creating a concavity in the table is just a
brute-foce approach to making sure there is no high spot near the center,
quicker and easier than finishing the table well.
