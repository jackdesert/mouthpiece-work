            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve been wanting to try this for years: use lead free solder to make 
baffles instead of epoxy. This was fairly easy to do since the solder 
melts at just slightly higher temps than standard 60/40. 

The main trouble is that the solder isn&#39;t very easy to file since it 
is softer than the Silverite that modern Dukoffs are made from. I 
ended up using cardboard fingernail files to remove the bulk of excess 
material and then finish with abrasive paper wrapped around files. 
After working up to 2000 grit, I polished with Flitz.

The main advantages are that is no waiting for epoxy to set, the 
baffle can be polished to a mirror finish and that the whole 
mouthpiece, baffle and all, can be plated over. I plan on finishing 
the soprano mouthpiece below and having it silver plated.

The photo you posted looks nice.  I see that as the only advantage.

Most of the time, I use an epoxy putty that sets in 5 minutes.  I can 
usually mold the shape I want with minimal filing and sanding.   It is 
the best option for "while-you-wait" service.

Could you please tell us the brand and source for the epoxy putty that sets so fast? The fastest setting epoxy putty I&#39;ve been able to find takes closer to an hour, and it can&#39;t be worked for a whole day.

I agree that a metal solder baffle will probably stay in better than most epoxies.  Also, being able to plate it is nice.  But that is for appearance too. 
 
Quick-set plumbers epoxy putty is found in home improvement and hardware stores.  I mostly use "Oatey" but there are similar ones out there.  Plumbers epoxy expands and contracts better with the metal thermal cycles than other epoxies like JB Weld or a brass power epoxy I used to use.    I have never had a report of Oatey falling out.

If you are concerned about an epoxy baffle coming out, just drill 4 shallow anchor holes in the sides of the mouthpiece, before you putting in the epoxy.

            <pre class='message__body'>Has anyone ever tried "FastSteel" from Home depot?  It is an epoxy that comes in a tube with one part of the epoxy rolled around the other in the tube.  When you mix them together with your fingers, kind of like mixing clay, it can be molded to a shape and sets up enough to be filed in about 10 minutes max. I have tried making a few baffles with it and it seems to work pretty well.  Not sure about exactly how long it will last, but I assure you it is the devil trying to get it out of a hard rubber mouthpiece.  Doable out of metal but not easy.  Let me know what you think.

I agree that a metal solder baffle will probably stay in better than most epoxies.  Also, being able to plate it is nice.  But that is for appearance too. 

Quick-set plumbers epoxy putty is found in home improvement and hardware stores.  I mostly use "Oatey" but there are similar ones out there.  Plumbers epoxy expands and contracts better with the metal thermal cycles than other epoxies like JB Weld or a brass power epoxy I used to use.    I have never had a report of Oatey falling out.

For me, there are other advantages besides the appearance. First, I&#39;ve 
seen many epoxy baffles fail after a few years in service. This could 
be due to porosity, shrinkage or other causes. I believe that the 
solder baffle will stay put. Time will tell.

The other advantage is that a mouthpiece prepared like this can be 
plated, baffle and all. Anderson Plating warns that epoxy baffles may 
fall out during the plating process.

This is something that I will probably use on my personal mouthpieces 
and a few others. It certainly won&#39;t work well for quick jobs.

I use the "Quik-Steel", which is a black epoxy for use with hard rubber 
mouthpieces.  I use another similar epoxy that is white on the outside, 
blue in the middle, and turns light gray when mixed and hardened, on 
metal mouthpieces.

            <pre class='message__body'>For a baffle I use too this Steel-Quick. Here in Europe is easy to find in any warehouse with Bostik name. Color is kinda brown-black on the outside and grey-blue inside. I use it one time to repair a table cracked on the arc of the window. It was a Florida so thin on this point... and with the time have had a piece of brass corrosed along the joint of the mpcs, as a stripe. I add a tape on the table and from inside I spread the epoxy in a thick manner and when dry I try to go back on the original thickness. Still my friend is playing that.

The only problem with this kind of epoxy is... it don&#39;t glue so good.
