            <pre class='message__body'>I recently bought a secondhand Boosey & Hawkes Emperor, and in the case was 
a spare black hard rubber mouthpiece. It&#39;s marked B & H England near the 
cork on the side opposite to the reed, and under it are the figures 593. 
Also stamped into the mouthpiece above the B & H marks is the number 2. The 
mouthpiece has very thick side rails, a very thin tip rail, and the facing 
curve is almost flat. The tip, looked at from above, is almost square 
instead of the normal curve. It&#39;s unlike any mouthpiece I&#39;ve ever come 
across and I find it to be pretty well unplayable. I&#39;d say it is unused, and 
I&#39;d be interested to know if anyone has any ideas as to what it might be.

From what you describe it sounds as if someone in tye past has tried to relay it and made a hash of it.

 I understood that the B&H 593 was a plastic mouthpiece supplied with the Regent student clarinet. This instrument had a bore of .593" like the Emperor and Imperial.
 I am working on a 926 which was the mouthpiece supplied with the intermediate and pro models.
 It seems to be made of a hard grade of ebonite. Lay(1)43/630...(2)46/650...(3)49/669

Tony, I think the B45 has a much smaller bore than the Emperor. Any intonation issues using small bore mouthpieces on large bore clarinets ?
 The Emperor is an excellent instrument. I have had mine for 50 years and many others have long gone.

I have just checked some mouthpieces for bore size.
Results show diameter at exit and 45 mm into bore in mm.

B&H 926 c 1980    15.3  -  14.3
B&H 926 c 1950s   15.3  -  14.2
Peter Eaton 926   15.3  -  14.3
Vandoren B40      14.9  -  13.9

The Emperor bore is 15.06mm parallel through top joint and barrel.
I have in past used various Vandorens including an A1 Crystal with reasonable success but for optimum intonation you are better off with the correct 926 bore.
Several UK makers have the requisite reamers and I guess it would not be too difficult to improvise something locally.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for that, Norman. I&#39;ve just checked mine, and it comes out at 14.65mm bore on my caliper.

Tony, is that 14.65 the bore of your Emperor?  and is it the bore of the top of the top joint?
With calipers it is only possible to measure the very ends of the bore and is is quite common for the bore at very top end of top joint to swell inwards over time due to moisture, especially if the wood is not oiled regularly.  Have you tried measuring the lower end of the joint as swelling is usually less of a problem there.
The only accurate way to measure is with a bore guage capable of going well down into the bore, this can also measure the barrel as well.
If you have problem with swelling at least on the B&H instruments it is relatively easy to ream to size as they are parallel and any competent tech should have a suitable expanding reamer (and know how to handle it).
Swelling at the top can play havoc with intonation so is well worth fixing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, Norman.
I&#39;ve had a look at the bore on the whole instrument, and have also checked it with a different caliper, and I&#39;ve established that the bore is parallel, with no swelling, and is indeed 14.65mm. I seem to recall reading somewhere that later production Emperors used a narrower bore than the earlier ones, and this one would have been one of the later ones, so might that be the case here, do you think? I used a tool normally used for checking gun barrels for bulging, and this bore is perfect.
I bought this on that well-known auction site about a year back, and when I opened it up I found an absolutely as-new 25-year old clarinet. My guess is that whoever originally had it decided after very little use that it wasn&#39;t for them and it was put away in the back of a cupboard somewhere. It&#39;s in a Besson case, and the serial number 575002 identifies it as very late production. I paid peanuts for it, so I think I scored a win.
It came with a Selmer HS* mouthpiece, which wasn&#39;t a great match for the instrument and gave stuffy throat tones. The Vandoren B45 fixed that problem, and the bore of the B45 at the end of the mouthpiece seems to be a close match to the instrument.

Regards,
Tony F.

Hi Tony
you have me stumped, I have never heard of an Emperor with a non-standard bore and I have handled many over past 50 years and at one time, as a NAMIR committee member, made fairly frequent visits to talk with the staff at the Edgware factory.
B&H did make some smaller bore models aimed specifically at the USA market but as far as I am aware these had totally unique model names or model numbers.
It&#39;s conceivable that they made some mistake in the factory and got their reamers or model marking mixed up.  Does is say Emperor on both the top joint and bell?
Yours must have been one of the very last clarinets made and things were going downhill in Edgware at that time so strange things could happen.
I own several Imperial 926&#39;s Bb&#39;s and A&#39;s including 1946, 1953 and 1979 vintages.
The bores of all except the 1979 are consistent at 15.0-15.1 even after all these years but the 1979 model is about 15.2 which makes me wonder if they didn&#39;t use a 1010 reamer on it, and this is an instrument that has probably only had 2/3 years playing since new.
Regards
Norman

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Norman,
It certainly seems to be an oddity. It&#39;s clearly marked Emperor on the bell 
and upperer joint, and the lower joint serial number is correct. Since my 
last post on this I&#39;ve checked a friends Emperor, and the bore on that one 
corresponds to yours, although his dates back to the early 60&#39;s.
The keywork on mine is silver plated brass and is clearly B & H. It has the 
typical B & H fat keys, which I&#39;ve thinned with a dremel to fit my rather 
large hands and fingers.The tenons are metal tipped. Despite the curious 
matter of the bore it&#39;s a delightful instrument to play

Eddie,
I&#39;ve oiled the bore on mine using peanut oil with 5% methylated spirit. It 
seems to work OK. It&#39;s the mixture I&#39;ve used for years, and I&#39;ve never yet 
had a clarinet split on me.

Hi Tony, my mechanical calper can only measure to the first decimal place, 
but the top joint of my 1959 Emperor Ser.No.172381 is 15.1mm & the bottom 
14.9mm.As the tenons are finished with metal rings, this suggests a reducing 
taper.It does appear that the later versions were of smaller bore.
The makers made a point of advertising the early ones as not needing oiling 
of the bore, because this was waxed.
I didn&#39;t want to take any chances and used the then recommended Linseed oil. 
No cracks, but dulling of the bore resulted. Changing over to Almond oil 
seemed to help.
