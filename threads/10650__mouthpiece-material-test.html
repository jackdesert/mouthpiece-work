            <pre class='message__body'>I took the test, listening with a pair of decent headphones to the MP3 files.  

My score was 50%.  Which is good, from my standpoint, as I am one of those that think that material doesn&#39;t matter - except to the player WRT things like beak size and the overall feel of the piece (and perhaps small bone conduction differences).  

I agree with other comments about the small differences in tone, I found myself going through the clips about 8 bars at a time trying to hear the resonance of the various notes for comparison. 

This is a good, if very casual, test.  Once you reveal the results I may have a few other comments, but I don&#39;t want to skew people&#39;s perception any.

            <pre class='message__body'>I took the quiz admittedly under the worst circumstances (crap headphones and mp3).  But I listened only for sound because things like intonation, attack, and other such factors can vary so much due to the player it&#39;s hard to attribute any of those differences to the mouthpiece material.  I found each of the clip comparisons to be very, very similar and I would not be able to tell you which was metal vs. plastic/hard rubber.  Like others have said, the player probably feels a difference but the sound heard by the audience is indiscernible imho.

Nice project...thanks for sharing.

I&#39;m having trouble visualizing a mechanism by which body vibration of makes the chamber smaller.    

Let me get this straight -- a more flexible (i.e. one with less inertia, less resistance to moving due to the pressure wave) material bows out more at the pressure antinodes, making it effectively larger than the same shape in a material that bows less from the pressue.  Is that what you&#39;re saying?

            <pre class='message__body'>Excessive wall vibrations alter the effective cross-sectional size of the air column for resonances according to frequency relationships.  Resonances with frequencies below the wall frequency will behave as if the bore were enlarged.  Those above wall frequency behave as if it were decreased.  So states Benade, who did extensive experiments to verify his writings.  I assume i&#39;s not about the hard-walled dimensions changing, rather, how the air next to the wall behaves.

It would be simple enough to evaluate the mouthpieces for effective volume/frequency characteristics without making any measurements.  Regardless of what the cause (vibrating beak, mouthpiece placement, etc.) the recordings displayed two distinctively different degrees of mouthpiece induced conical
 air column effects - one good match, one considerably less so.

The second reed idea is misleading.  The way the reed resonance can contribute energy that sustains the harmonic regime is similar to how you push someone on a swing to keep them swinging.  Pushing only works within a narrow range of the swinging cycle and within that range, the efficiency of pushing varies from just functional to optimal, depending on the exact point of the cycle in question.  The reed resonance must satisfy certain conditions, and then, for each air column resonance, it can only contribute energy at one specific frequency which is somewhere below that particular air column resonance&#39;s peak amplitude frequency.  The reed resonance must be flexible and controllable enough to enable the player to place it, via minor embouchure pressure changes, optimally over the entire range of the instrument.  The idea that you can design a mouthpiece beak to
 function in the same manner with the air column is a bit unrealistic IMO.

The player will most certainly experience the beak vibration through the teeth/bone to the inner ear however, however musical that may be or not.

      That hadn&#39;t even occurred to me, except to consider that possibly if the tip vibrates enough it could increase fuctional volume by acting like a second reed to an extent.  I&#39;m having trouble visualizing a mechanism by which body vibration of makes the chamber smaller.    



Let me get this straight -- a more flexible (i.e. one with less inertia, less resistance to moving due to the pressure wave) material bows out more at the pressure antinodes, making it effectively larger than the same shape in a material that bows less from the pressue.  Is that what you&#39;re saying?

What could be different -- deburred lightly by hand, could make some difference.  the attack transients, IDK maybe the lighter beak is vibrating and acting a little like a second reed or something.

https://ccrma.stanford.edu/marl/Benade/documents/Benade-Physics323-1977.pdf - last few pages on reed transconductance.

Anyway, I thought I might have noticed some very slight brightness differences on note attacks (termed transients - that specterally rapid changing first part of the note from which we recognize (mostly) the type of instrument it is) but it was hard to nail down since Dave was playing different licks in the samples.  I guess for Joe Blow&#39;s practical purposes it debunks the "material" issue if you have to get that nit-picky.

Actually, hard rubber dulls cutters pretty well, too -- it cuts fast but it&#39;s pretty abrasive, seems like I&#39;m always going through roughing cutters.  IDK, maybe I&#39;m feeding too slow. If I was going to use anything besides hard rubber I&#39;d probably use acetal (delrin).  Cuts like butter, holds tolerances well, cheap, machined finish is good.  Bit of a pain to hand finish and never got it to polish well, though.

            <pre class='message__body'>Though I&#39;ve done pretty well on PC using carbide grit so maybe a carbide tipped cutter will work better.  Have to try it.  It&#39;s nice (when it happens by accident) to be able to drop the mouthpiece on it&#39;s tip from 4 ft, on a cement floor, and not get a scratch on it.  LOL.

      Yeah, that&#39;s the problem with pc.  I&#39;ve never used it, just dismissed it out of hand because it&#39;s hard to machine. 



Actually, hard rubber dulls cutters pretty well, too -- it cuts fast but it&#39;s pretty abrasive, seems like I&#39;m always going through roughing cutters.  IDK, maybe I&#39;m feeding too slow. If I was going to use anything besides hard rubber I&#39;d probably use acetal (delrin).  Cuts like butter, holds tolerances well, cheap, machined finish is good.  Bit of a pain to hand finish and never got it to polish well, though.

shouldn&#39;t this be on the mouthpiece acoustics site and not here?
