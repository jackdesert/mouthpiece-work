            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all
This is my first post . I&#39;ve been enjoying reading through the old
ones and learning a lot .
My Tenor V16 has bite dents that are becoming very annoying .
It seems like I should try filling the teeth dents before actualy
replacing the plate.
Regarding epoxy I read that JB Weld was good but that Plumbers Putty
was better because it doesn&#39;t have as many carcinogens . I tried
"Magnum Steel" 5 minute epoxy. It was supposed to work on metals and
plastic and be sandable but it wouldn&#39;t stick so I am now trying super
glue gel .
After it dries I&#39;ll mask and file then use a clear patch .
Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated .

Regarding the clear plastic patches I got a roll of something at Tap
Plastic (I think it&#39;s for auto masking} . It was under a dollar for a
couple feet and is a little thinner then the Runyon clear patches.
With contact cement it will never come off but I recently discoverd
after being cut they stay on pretty well with no glue at all .

They have been implicated in all sorts of nasty ailments including testicular cancer and falling sperm counts. You really should use a dental epoxy or one that is approved for oral use if it is going to be in contact with your mouth and saliva.

An alternative would be to use a cyanoacrylate (superglue)--the gel form is probably good--to fill the toothmarks before applying the bite plate. If the bite plate covers the entire area that you&#39;ve patched then probably even epoxy is OK, but why take chances?

That is some good information . I just spoke to a teacher that used JB
Weld to fix a chip on the tip of a clarinet mouthpiece for one of his
students .I&#39;ll let him know of the dangers .Do you (or anyone)have any
info on dental epoxy ? I think certain types require a black light
device to harden .

            <pre class='message__body'>Stephen Howard used to use JB to fill toothmarks and I warned him also about this. He wrote directly to JB and they told him that their product was not recommended for oral use. If the surface area is small--like a chip--there probably isn&#39;t much danger, but a lot of exposed epoxy surface could lead to problems of leaching.

Like anything else it is a question of exposure. It&#39;s worth knowing that there is a possible danger, even if slight.

Acrylic casting resin is another possibility. It doesn&#39;t contain the plasticizers which cause the problem.
