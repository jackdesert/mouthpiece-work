            <pre class='message__body'>I want to thank all of you that are helping me (no harm meant by this) 
to learn about the different instruments and things.  I want to ask you 
all why do some saxophonists not like to play or even try clarinet or 
bass clarinet?  My thinking is that a bass clarinet mouthpiece and tenor 
saxophone are similar, plus the angle of which to play is similar.  I 
have even "heard of" saxophonists using a bass clarinet maybe in a 
saxophone choir.  Any thoughts about this?

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually most big band sax players (alto at least) will double on clarinet
and flute as a matter of necessity.  And in my senior year of high school, I
was bored and decided to play contrabass clarinet in the symphonic band.
The darn thing nearly shook my face off in the lower register.. But I never
remember being able to pick up a girl because of being a contrabass clarinet
player.  So needless to say my contrabass days were quite limited!  ;-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Actually, MANY saxophonists play clarinet.  A lot, like me, started on clarinet and later picked up sax because of the similarities.  Since sax fingering is actually SIMPLER than clarinet, it is much easier to move from clarinet to sax than from sax to clarinet.

If you have to mic a saxophone, the rest of the band is TOO LOUD!
