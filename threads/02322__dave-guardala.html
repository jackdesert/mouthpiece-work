            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:

Does anyone know what has happened to Mr. Dave Guardala?  Much has 
been said about his mouthpieces, but nothing of the man himself.

Doing my &#39;research&#39; , I only know that he was invloved in some kind 
of lawsuit resulting from some people trying to make &#39;copies&#39; of his 
mouthpieces.

Can someone enlighten me here?

From various postings on usenet lately it appears that Guardala might have a new product idea that they will be marketing soon.

I don&#39;t believe that he personally has anything to do with the laser trimmed models anymore.

hangs out at alt.music.saxophone.  He has a rather forceful

DG&#39;s mouthpieces play easily with open tips because they have superb 
facings on them.  Some of the Laser Trims are very good too, but most 
of the ones WW&BW sells has minor defects in the facing.  They are 
not hand finished even though the box says they are.  They are nice 
machine-made mouthpieces.

Orpheus Music in San Antonio, TX.
 
Orpheus Music also has the Vespro line of saxes, B&S, and Pearl Flutes, 
and other product lines.   At the last trade show I attended Orpheus had 
a booth for their other products, and still had LASax as a separate 
booth.  Future of the Guardala line at this time is uncertain.

yawn.....

....One thing he will say is he revolutonized the manufacture of 
saxophone mouthpieces, ad infinitum. the way he talks it makes you 
wonder if Dave added anything besides his name.

My understanding is that WW&BW own the Guardala
mouthpiece lines.  Thus, they are cnc&#39;d some where
other than under Dave&#39;s control.

Hi:

Maybe someone can help me.  Where the heck is
Guardala? I am sure he knows people are paying up to
$2000 for his &#39;80s made done pieces. I am wondering
why he doesn&#39;t start doing that again, even if he had
to pimp his name to someone else>

            <pre class='message__body'>According to Abbedd (Jeff Powell) it was getting to be too much for him to hand finish all the pieces himself, because (if I remember correctly) Abbedd said that he was spending 5-6 hours on each piece after it came off the CNC machine.

You could always post the question on alt.sax--Abbedd answers everything having to do with Guardala, and a lot more besides ;-)

  Hi:

  Maybe someone can help me.  Where the heck is
  Guardala? I am sure he knows people are paying up to
  $2000 for his &#39;80s made done pieces. I am wondering
  why he doesn&#39;t start doing that again, even if he had
  to pimp his name to someone else>
