I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re looking to the tip rail as a solution to a different
problem actually - which is the profile of the baffle in the zone of about
1/4" behind the tip rail.

Refacing alters this profile. And this can have a profound influence on how
the mouthpiece plays.

Moreover, it&#39;s a dicey bit of adjustment in my (albeit limited) experience.
It seems very sensitive to small changes.  And I find it difficult to
actually measure the shape of the baffle in this area (if there is a good
way to do this, I&#39;d like to know it.) One needs some combination of a depth
gauge plus a way of setting the distance from the mouthpiece tip when
measuring.

I&#39;ve used a profile gauge as a way of comparing this baffle profile in one
mouthpiece that played well to another that didn&#39;t. Crude, but gets one into
the ballpark.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, that is what I would aim for, 0.7mm to 0.8mm width.

I would classify wider than 0.8mm as a wide rail and less than 0.7mm as a thin rail.

However, tip rail widths up to 1mm are not uncommon.  Thin tip rails can give an easier response but do mean you have to have a reed shape with a close fit in order to get a good seal.

To ascertain the baffle shape right behind the tip rail, I simply sight a small stainless steel ruler on edge against the baffle.  This will give an idea of how much curvature there is there.  If the baffle is too high it will choke off the sound or even touch the reed prior to the rail, resulting in a tendency to squeal or chirp.

Andrew

            <pre class='message__body'>I ran across an interesting bit of Benade, IIRC, in which
he strongly recommends a cutting a groove in the baffle
just behind the tip rail to optimize the response of the
reed aeroacoustically. I personally have always found that
taking some material off just behind the tip rail helps to
keep the reed from chirping, although I have never gone so
far as to actually cut a step behind the tip rail. However
it is certainly true that refacing can effectively raise
the height of the baffle just behind the tip rail, and you
might have to cut that back down after finishing the
reface in order to get response similar to what you had
originally.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m not sure we can blame chirping on thin tip rails.  I had the pleasure of trying several Meyer Brothers pieces a few weeks ago -- altos and baris.  They all had hairline tip rails -- not just thin, but all but non-existent.  Every one of them articulated very very well, even on reeds that don&#39;t line up perfectly.  At best I think maybe a wider tip rail tends to dampen all vibration of the reed, incuding the tendency to vibrate at its on frequency (chirping), as wider side rails do.  This can inhibit a tendency to chirp that has another cause (asymmetry, too-high baffle, etc.).

FWIW, I routinely use pretty thin tip rails, almost always &lt;.5mm, unless I&#39;m trying to darken/deaden the sound of a piece.

One part is that they do not always line up the reed well and/or they use a reed that may be a little damaged.  Other parts are a tight embouchure with very little mouthpiece taken in and the pressence high blowing pressure in an effert to get the set-up to speak or to play louder.  A thick tip rail can not fix all of these issues but it can make it easier to get the reed to seal at the tip.  It also removes the "highs" from sound spectrum which I think come from the very tip of the reed vibrating.  A squeak is high partial running amuck.

            <pre class='message__body'>  In response to Barry Levine...tip rail again topic is "again"...my initial post was a baffle that is deep with a wide tip rail....goal was to free up the mouthpiece as it was slightly stuffy.  Thanks for all this info.  Of course isolating factors like tip rail is a prickly subject and there are many ideas here.  I&#39;m going to do some experimenting with  variable tip rails...wide on one side and narrow on the other, narrow in the middle and wide on the sides.  I&#39;m sure it will amount to nothing but I&#39;ll counterbalance this with doing some conventional refacing on other mouthpieces.  Too many variables, too much time.

            <pre class='message__body'>Squeaking is caused AFAIK by a lateral rocking motion of
the reed around the longitudinal axis--the reed twists
from side to side, touching first one side of the tip rail

at one of its natural resonance frequencies.

Obviously uneven rails will cause a reed to twist
somewhat, making the development of a squeak more likely,

changes the way the reed responds due to the Bernoulli
effect. I wish I had the quote at hand, but IIRC the point

I suspect that a thin tip rail, if it is even, creates no

it is very thin. The point of the game is to get the reed
to open and close as a unit without twisting on its
midline.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sounds like the mouthpiece is only slightly uneven somewhere.

Without the neck/body, the mouthhpiece is a very short cylindrical
tube, without a constriction.  The resonances of the short air column
normally do have enough energy to overpower the reed&#39;s vibrations,
unless the mouthpiece is inhibiting the formation of stable harmonic
regimes by being improperly designed or slightly uneven somewhere. 

Adding the mouthpiece to the conical tube couples the two air columns. The new air column resonances
generate enough energy to overpower the reed and force it to vibrate at
the air column&#39;s frequency, despite the minor problems with the
mouthpiece.

I play a tenor Ponzol HR Vintage in 0.105" opening. 
Blowing the MP alone I find many reeds almost impossible to not squeek. Many of 
these play fine with MP on the horn.
 
I&#39;m hoping this discussion will give me some 
insight into causes and cures.

  Squeaking is caused AFAIK by a lateral rocking motion of
the reed around 
  the longitudinal axis--the reed twists
from side to side, touching first 
  one side of the tip rail
and then the other. Because this doesn&#39;t allow a 
  standing
wave to develop in the bore, the reed is free to vibrate
at one 
  of its natural resonance frequencies.

Obviously uneven rails will cause 
  a reed to twist
somewhat, making the development of a squeak more 
  likely,
but apparently a high baffle just behind the tip rail
changes 
  the way the reed responds due to the Bernoulli
effect. I wish I had the 
  quote at hand, but IIRC the point
is that to effectively get the reed to 
  oscillate you need
a bit of space just behind the tip rail. If I can 
  locate
it I will post it.

I suspect that a thin tip rail, if it is 
  even, creates no
problem, but any unevenness will tend to be magnified 
  if
it is very thin. The point of the game is to get the reed
to open and 
  close as a unit without twisting on its
midline.

That is an excellent question! Does the mouthpiece produce the same note this way? If so, the motion could be similar and slow motion photography could be informative.

We need a slow motion camera in someone&#39;s mouth to see how the reed really moves. Theory and quotes aside, how can we do this without surgery? I want to see this!

            <pre class='message__body'>A couple of people have mentioned squeaking coming from uneven or tipped rails.  Here&#39;s something that I tried on a couple of mps and had good results despite being quick and dirty test as to mp symmetry.

I have a BARI alto reed that is transluscent plastic (as are Leguerre).  Put the reed on and go to the bathroom sink.  Holding the reed tight agaist the lay, fill the mp with water.  Put the shank end in your mouth and suck until you can let go of the reed and hold the reed against the lay with suction.  As you reduce the suction (or maybe you won&#39;t even have to), you can find where air first enters by the seeing the bubbles.  You might have to apply pressure to the reed to get a good test at the tip area, depending on the lay and the stiffness of the reed.

This can show you possible problem areas.  Maybe a tiny uneveness in the lay on one side.  Maybe an uneven tip.  Maybe an uneven rail.  The actual problem can be detected with further inspection and measuring.  The test can quickly point you to the right area if it is a problem caused by uneveness.

Of the mps I&#39;ve tried this on, two failed miserably.  One mouthpiece leaked first about halfway up the lay on one side.  Since the problem was between two feeler gauge measurements, after I saw the leak I went back with interim measurements and the uneveness showed up better on the plot.  That mp was just a little dull and unresponsive.  Since it was hard rubber and I was refacing it, I probably would have gotten the area anyway, but now I knew to pay special attention to that area.

My second "problem" mp squeaked sometimes.  It leaked air badly under the suction test right at the junction of one tip/side rail.  It was perfectly even when measured, but that area was tipped enough so that the sealing area was thin and it failed there first.  I had to open the mp up slightly to get rid of that sunken area, which required some adjustment of the whole lay, but it stopped the squeaking.  The leaky tip was on an Otto Link STM that might have been worked on before but that probably didn&#39;t cause the problem.  It was either made that way or dropped without sustaining any obvious damage (I&#39;d guess the latter).

Once the rails are smooth and the same width, the suction failure tends to be more "catastrophic" and there aren&#39;t any small areas that fail first.  Your results may vary.  I&#39;m thinking of getting a BARI tenor reed just for using for a suction test.

I have for some time used this method to teach students what an embouchure needs to do.  If one puts a finger on each side of the reed over the side rails and presses down while sucking through the shank end of the mouthpiece, one will see the reed vibration change to a flat form.  Also, to demonstrate the bad effects of too much biting, put a finger over the whole flat surface of the reed at this point and press down - you will see that the opening disappears and then it is very hard to get air through. No air, no vibration!

Cheers,

Geoff Secomb.

            <pre class='message__body'>No, the reed motion sucking is much different than blowing; first because lip damping plays a very large role in the behavior of the reed, and second because reed behavior is also controlled by the coupling to the air column of the sax.

The easy way to accomplish this would be with an artificial embouchure.

I remember seeing this video.  The reed did not move smoothly open and closed, but rather, in a series of starts and stops corresponding with the overtones.  It followed the wave shape for 50% of the cycle (180 degrees) and the other half was open to varying degrees, a series of steps open and closed.  Very interesting.

            <pre class='message__body'>The reed is probably closed for the amount of time it takes a sound wave to travel from the mouthpiece to the open tone hole and back... traveling at the speed of sound.  It is interesting that no air moves past the tip while the reed is closed for this brief moment.  Yet the player has the sensation that the air flow is constant.

            <pre class='message__body'>For cylindrical instruments, the closed/open ratio is close to 50/50.  For conical instruments, it varies depending upon the note being played and the frequency of Frs:  Reed closed time = ratio of tube length to Frs, and can be as little as 25/75.   Once the reed closes, the air column becomes a resonating chamber.  A partial reflection of the wave occurs at the mouthpiece constriction/body tube opening, which returns to the mouthpiece and opens the reed again.  This is part of the reason why a soprano sax is lounder than a clarinet.

The reed is probably closed for the amount of time it takes a sound wave to travel from the mouthpiece to the open tone hole and back... traveling at the speed of sound.  It is interesting that no air moves past the tip while the reed is closed for this brief moment.  Yet the player has the sensation that the air flow is constant.

One does notice that a clarinet plays with more resistance than a soprano saxophone.
