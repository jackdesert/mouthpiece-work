            <pre class='message__body'>OK, I got myself a set of digital calipers (Metric and Standard) and 
I know where to get the glass gauges.

Does it matter what length the feeler gauges are? Lee Valley Tools in 
here in Toronto is a great place for picking up stuff like this, and 
they have a set in their catalogue that are 5.5 inches long...

They also advertise a granite surface plate that&#39;s 9"x12"x2" and 
accurate to +/- 0.0001" overall. It&#39;s $39.95CDN. Sounds like just the 
thing for a facing plate.

Thoughts?

            <pre class='message__body'>I think shorter feelers will be easier to work with.  Like 4" long.

Granite would be a great surface, its just not very portable.

OK, I&#39;ll look for shorter ones then.

I&#39;m gonna get the granite plate, since portability isn&#39;t really an 
issue right now, and the price looks good to me.

Is the Dremel flexshaft attachment any good? I already have a Dremel 
tool...

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not know about any problems with the Dremmel.  I have an old Weller
Rotary tool that I have repaired several times.  I have a generic flex
shaft attachment I got for it from Micro-Mark.  I also have a variable
speed foot petal by Dremmel which seems real solid.  I rigged up my own
post to hold the motor.  There is a pic in the photos section.

This is not an essential tool to get started with.  But when you get into
interior modifications, it is great to start with the rotary tool then
finish off with hand filing.

            <pre class='message__body'>The flexshaft attachment is the logical extension of the dremel tool. Once you own it, it&#39;ll stay on your Dremel  permanantly.
