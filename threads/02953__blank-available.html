            <pre class='message__body'>If someone needs one of the recent blanks from this list, I am willing 
to part with mine at the cost plus shipping. I bought an old Zephyr bari 
that had suffered all the abuse a grade school can provide, and I am 
thoroughly enjoying making it look like a sax.... and play like a fog 
horn on steroids!  Though a little dimpled, I have a bell again!  
Needless to say, the forseeable hobby time will be consumed by this  
project, and I am willing to pass on the blank. Email me offlist - jim 
at sisqtel.net - if you are interested. Bt the way, if you are not 
familiar with the Rico Graftonite MPs, they are a lot of MP for under 
$20.  Interesting design, the casting is done such that only the raised 
rails need to be ground, and they offer a choice of three grinds per 
chamber.  This piece and the first 5 playable notes on the Conn Zephyr 
absolutely HOOKED me - there is a big ol&#39; FAT sound waiting to be 
liberated in the horn.
