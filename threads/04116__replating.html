Caswell Plating is the place to start.  They sell kits specifically for 
small users like us.

Some of our members have had success with nickel plating. 

When you reface a silver plated mouthpiece the silver can be restored 
with a "brush plater".  A brush plater is also good for spot touchups on 
silver plated saxes, on key touches, tops of posts, etc. 

Gold plating, such as on Links, is a very thin flash of gold over silver 
plating.  So, it is necessary to first silver plate,  then apply gold.  
This can all be done with brush plating kits.  Some kits actually have a 
small brush, others use a gauze swab. 

But Caswell is the place to start.

As you saw there are some brush plating photos.  There are also some photos
in the eMachineShop folder showing the results of my own Nickel plating.  I
used an electroless Nickel plating kit from Caswell.

The key to the process is to get the bath hot enough.  The heaters Caswell
supplied me were substitutes that were barely adequate.  I had to insulate
the bath bucket by wrapping it with a blanket and use a lab thermometer to
get up to temperature. Then the next milestone is to start the plating
reaction.  You need to touch the brass with a piece of steel for a couple
minutes to make sure the plating gets started.  I used a coat hanger wire
with the paint sanded off.

It is worth mentioning that nickel is a well-known contact allergen.  I&#39;ve
known people who cannot, for example, wear inexpensive ear-rings, because
the posts are nickel plated.

This should be a consideration for anyone thinking about plating a
mouthpiece in nickel.

As a side note, Google shows 67,900 items for "nickel allergy" vs. 234 for
"silver allergy".

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Members,

I inherited a Guy Hawkins #7 metal mpc with my Selmer Series II 55A
Bari Sax.  In the beginning, I felt the mpc was unsuitable until I
had some adjustments made on the sax.  It plays so much better, I
think I don&#39;t really need to look at at Berg Larsen.  To my 
understand-
ing this mpc is a 115.  Have no idea of, I believe, chamber as 
Larsens have sizes of 0,1,2, & 3.  Does anyone have any idea.  Any-
way, the cork is too small so I imagine when it&#39;s replaced the horn
will sing (fingers crossed).

A question is chipping/flaking does appear at the tip.  I happened
to use a tooth cushion for a hard rubber and when I peeled it off -
off came some of the plating.  The mpc seems to be made of brass with
a chrome, silver or whatever plating.  The is also some peeling under
the tip. The rest of the plating is immaculate. Can/will this mpc 
pose any future problems with this flaking?  

If I was to consider it to be reworked to a Berg Larsen 120/125 2,
is it possible?  What can I expect.  Any suggestions as to other
mpc designs/facings to consider is also appreciated.  Thanks.

Sincerely,
Harry

A Berg is not a good mouthpiece to determine a rework target.  A 120 Berg
will usually have a tip opening of .110", but it may be anywhere from .095"
to .130".  So if you played a Berg once that you loved and wanted a similar
piece, you would need to have it measured to figure out what you really liked.

  I don&#39;t mind working on brass.  Not much harder to do than hard rubber.
   
  The worst metal to work on is the Dukoff "Silverite", which is so soft that just measuring with feelers and glass gauge will damage the table and side rails.

I consider tasting brass annoying.  You may have a higher tolerance than I
do.  After a long gig, my next meal did not taste right.

But it is not dangerous for most people.  If you are alergic to brass, I&#39;m
told you will feel a tingle in your lips after a short while.  There is no
such thing as brass poisoning.  Some brass has lead in it.  I would hope
mouthpiece makers use lead-free brass.  Makers of water fittings do.

You can contact me privately to discuss my plating rates.  I do very little
of it and there should be others who can do it cheaper.  A lot of the cost
is in the prepartion work.  If you do all the prep work you may be able to
find someone who plates for as little as $10 a mouthpiece.
