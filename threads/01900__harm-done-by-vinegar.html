            <pre class='message__body'>I have had 2 bad experiances soaking plated metal mouthpieces in 
vinegar.  

First was a gold-plated Ponzol.  I had about 2/3ds of the MP in a 
vinegar/water mix.  A ring was etched away from the gold at the air-
liquid interface.

The second experiance was a nickle-plated Link 2000.  The NP was not 
removed but it left a ring around the piece.  I had to buff it some 
to take 80% of it away, but some was still left.

I do not understand what the mechanism could be but I would suspect 
some minerals in my tap water are involved.  I think if I 100% 
immerse a piece it will be fine.  I only do the cruddy ones.

I have not had a problem with SS or heavy chrome plate.  I think I 
have done other gold-plated pieces in the past without noticing a 
problem.  Perhaps I used 100% vinegar, but I&#39;m not sure.

I have never seen any reports of problems like this.  Anyone seen 
this?

            <pre class='message__body'>I use the vinegar only on rubber or plastic pieces, and only if really 
bad.  Calcified saliva stains can usually be gently scrubbed off metal 
without damaging it, but occasionally you get a tough one.
