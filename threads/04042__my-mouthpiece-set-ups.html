I would think your reeds would warp.But what ever works is great. I 
use a selmer reed case that holds 10 reed I rotate my reeds every day 
and they last a long time I also wet my reeds in rum before I play. I 
never soak a reed to long that to me makes them sound dull

Sorry man, I couldn&#39;t resist a chuckle when I read that!  That reminds 
me of a story of the great tenor man Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, who used 
to experiment with mixed drinks while he was on the Basie band - he 
would put a tape recorder under his chair during dance jobs and record 
himself after drinking various cocktail combinations.  He discovered 
that Scotch and Milk produced the best solos.  That&#39;s no joke!  What a

You got to love it. I will say I do like the way my reeds taste. All 
kidding aside I think it is important to sterilize the reeds if you 
are getting a lot of colds it may be from the reeds. I almost never 
catch a cold sense I started using the rum. Of course kids can use 
other sterilizers

jimmitch, i do use a La Voz reed holder when storing the reeds in the zip-lock bag. check 
out www.ricoreeds.com.  they have a (relatively) new product called "The Reed Vitalizer" 
which is suprisingly similar to my scheme. looks like some enterprising people took the 
idea further and just made our sax lives easier for us.

            <pre class='message__body'>Some things I have noticed about reeds along these lines ...

Reeds stored at high humidity (like in a zip loc bag, especially in
summer) tend to milldew sometimes. This is particularly true of new
reeds which still contain a fair amount of the monomer sugars from the
growth of the cane. In the first few wettings, reeds lose several
percent (up to 10%) of their weight as these monomer sugars and other
water soluble stuff (minerals, microdust, etc) wash out. A long time
ago, I did some studies on the effect of storing reeds at various
humidities. Higher humidities were very good in terms of maintaining
response and sound, but when it&#39;s too high, the reeds milldew,
espacially new ones.

A good way to steralize reeds without degrading performance is to soak
them a few minutes in a 50/50 mix of peroxide (3% solution from any
drugstore) and tap water, then rinse with tap water. Store peroxide in
the refrigerator to keep it from decomposing. If a reed mildews, or
gets old and non-responsive, often peroxide will restore its
performance (but it still may look bad due to discoloration.)

The surest way to warp a reed is to soak it too long, thus letting the
water wick up through the xylems into the butt end of the reed. Only
soak them briefly to wet the surface of the blade, but not long enough
to wick up water into the xylems. A new clarinet reed typically weighs
about 1.7 grams, but can wick up 200 to 500% or more of its weight in
water if soaked long enough (like overnight). Once waterlogged, it
takes many, many days for all the water to evaporate. During this
time, its mass is higher than normal, thus it gives a sluggish
response. I have studied the wetting and drying rates of reeds - old
and new, and have lots of data on that somewhere. Once the reed has
its "pores closed" the water no longer can wick into the xylems and
therefore waterlogging and warping is not as likely to occur.

I have been meaning to experiment with various methods of closing the
pores, like rubbing in a drop of vegatable or mineral oil, or
glycerine. Most folks just rub the pores shut with their finger,
filling them with oils and other crud from their hands. But I never
got around to doing that experiment with oil. I once heard that
somebody used mayonnaise, which is just a form of oil, to close the
pores. Anybody have any info on various methods of closing pores?

Rotating reeds from day to day keeps them at a good moisture content
and I have found that they perform better that way.

BTW - I&#39;ve been using Fibracell reeds exclusively for the last six 
years or so - no warping, no mold, no funny smell...
and I don&#39;t have to soak them in anything!

Other sax players are always surprised to discover that I use
a synthetic reed because I have such a warm tone (so I&#39;m told, 
anyway :-)

            <pre class='message__body'>I had a clarinet teacher once, named Cloyde Williams, principal of MN
Orch. who showed me how to make a "reed humidifier" out of Tupperware.
Get yourself a large Tupperware container, and fashion a "shelf" out of
plastic to set the reeds on that will sit about 3 inches above the
bottom of the container.  Then take sea salt and boil a solution of
water and sea salt until it is super-saturated, then add a bunch more
salt until it is sitting out of solution in the bottom of the pan.  Pour
the whole thing, including the extra salt, into the bottom of the
Tupperware, let it cool, add the shelf in, and you then can set your
reeds on the shelf.  Cover the thing with the Tupperware lid.  Reeds
stay humid, NEVER mildew, and are ready to go at any time.  It&#39;s not
portable, because if you get the salt on the reed it&#39;s finished (clogs
the pores).  But, it&#39;s a good way to store your reeds at home and then
you take them out to use them on a gig, etc.  It worked great.  It&#39;s
important to use sea salt, as iodized table salt did not prevent mildew.
 
Regarding synthetic reeds, try the Legere reeds.  They are pretty good.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Re: my mouthpiece set ups


Some things I have noticed about reeds along these lines ...

Reeds stored at high humidity (like in a zip loc bag, especially in
summer) tend to milldew sometimes. This is particularly true of new
reeds which still contain a fair amount of the monomer sugars from the
growth of the cane. In the first few wettings, reeds lose several
percent (up to 10%) of their weight as these monomer sugars and other
water soluble stuff (minerals, microdust, etc) wash out. A long time
ago, I did some studies on the effect of storing reeds at various
humidities. Higher humidities were very good in terms of maintaining
response and sound, but when it&#39;s too high, the reeds milldew,
espacially new ones.

A good way to steralize reeds without degrading performance is to soak
them a few minutes in a 50/50 mix of peroxide (3% solution from any
drugstore) and tap water, then rinse with tap water. Store peroxide in
the refrigerator to keep it from decomposing. If a reed mildews, or
gets old and non-responsive, often peroxide will restore its
performance (but it still may look bad due to discoloration.)

The surest way to warp a reed is to soak it too long, thus letting the
water wick up through the xylems into the butt end of the reed. Only
soak them briefly to wet the surface of the blade, but not long enough
to wick up water into the xylems. A new clarinet reed typically weighs
about 1.7 grams, but can wick up 200 to 500% or more of its weight in
water if soaked long enough (like overnight). Once waterlogged, it
takes many, many days for all the water to evaporate. During this
time, its mass is higher than normal, thus it gives a sluggish
response. I have studied the wetting and drying rates of reeds - old
and new, and have lots of data on that somewhere. Once the reed has
its "pores closed" the water no longer can wick into the xylems and
therefore waterlogging and warping is not as likely to occur.

I have been meaning to experiment with various methods of closing the
pores, like rubbing in a drop of vegatable or mineral oil, or
glycerine. Most folks just rub the pores shut with their finger,
filling them with oils and other crud from their hands. But I never
got around to doing that experiment with oil. I once heard that

            <pre class='message__body'>I use the Fred Hemke method to close the reed pores,
basically sand them closed with a #600 paper. First
rub 2 pieces of sandpaper together to smooth them out,
then go from the heart to the tip until it&#39;s smooth. I
also use olive oil on the softer reeds, just wet them
with oil for a few minutes then wipe them off. Oiled
reeds play denser and seem to last longer, also they
are less sensitive to climate.  If you do the oil
before the sanding the oil will soak in deeper. The
sanding can be repeated almost every time the reed is
played cuz the pores swell up open again. I use soft
reeds for this &#39;cuz they don&#39;t seem to break in as
much over time.

yes, peter, i&#39;ve been experiencing mildew on my reeds for the past few years, way before i 
started storing my reeds in a ziploc bag. i&#39;ve been trying to alleviate this (but to no avail) 
by cleaning my reeds, mouthpieces and reed holders with soap, rinsing them, then 
sterilizing them in isopropyl alchohol. i&#39;m not sure if the alchohol is ok.

to Jimmitch, Brent (ko4py) and Doug: thanks for your inputs on this matter. 

Brent, what i got from the drugstore was "hydrogen peroxide". they say its the same as 
peroxide. started using it today and will observe the results in the coming days. by the 
way, what can you say about using (isopropyl) alchohol to sterilize reeds and m&#39;pieces? 

Doug, the "reed humidifier" sounds like something that&#39;ll hit the market soon, much like 
Rico&#39;s "Reed Vitalizer".

This is a popular thread. In the past I have used Dark Rum with a dash
of Pepermint to enhance the playing experience. I see this as having
redeeming properties.
The vapourising Rum(alcohol)sterilises the reed, mouthpiece and horn
while blowing, the pepermint clears the airways, especially if you
have a cold. The case benefits too, as it prevents it turning FOOSTY
as we say in Scotland. Now, then there is Whisky.............  Eddie
