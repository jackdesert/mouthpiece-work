            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

I have a Brilhart Ebolin 2* that actually measures:

0.0015     59/57
0.005      43/45
0.009      33/33
0.016      25/25
0.024      17/17
0.037      10/10

Tip = .0515

It has some small nicks in the Tip/Tip Rail.  Also, the rear of the table is very narrow relative to the reed and the front of the table.

I would like to open it up a little more and fix the chips.  Can you give me a facing schedule that would work for what I want to do?

Thank you,

David

    This is an English Brilhart  2 facing. I bought it new in 1972. It has always been a rather nice player.

The measurements given for an Ebolin are extreme David. A 2* should have a tip of 0.043" and the length 15mm.

As you want to open the tip I will give you the measurements of my Ponzol 53.    53 tip  18mm length
   0.0015"  36 B
   0.005    32
   0.010    24.2
   0.015    21
   0.025    13.9
   0.035    8.1
   0.045    3.9
I looks to me as if you need to lower the table. Correct me if I am wrong somebody.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I was thinking the same thing \- the facing length is extremely long for
clarinet (kind of off the bell curve \- this would be a long facing for bari
sax...), and the tip is quite open. I know that tip opening preferences vary
greatly, but I'd think twice before opening up a clarinet piece beyond this
one's current .0515. I think this is at the high end of the comfortable range,
even for most of us sax/clarinet doublers. I don't have lots of refacing
experience on clarinet mouthpieces, though.  
  
If there's a high spot on the table, and you're holding your thumb towards the
back of the table when measuring with the glass gauge, it will measure
extremely long (at .0015) like this. Although usually the subsequent feeler
measurements aren't nearly as exaggerated.

the info you need, but check them out. I know Keith has made some ridiculously
large tip opening clarinet pieces which (if I remember correctly) don't have
the usual flat part in the middle, but were more like radial sax curves (like
an alto piece).

I found some facing curves under files, clarinet that refer to messages 3179 and 2445. Message 5844 talks about an eliptical curve being better. But as to which curve would be a good one, I hope a guru will take the time to give you some specifics.

            <pre class='message__body'>This doesn&#39;t answer your question directly, but it might be helpful to  
you and some others.  When I first joined this list I had the same  
problem that you are having.  I found it very time consuming to search  
for information on the website and even more difficult to "catch up"  
and read all previous messages, which I eventually did.  My solution  
was to use a perl program to suck all of the previous messages out of  
yahoo and into my mail client.  I used a program called yahoo2mbox,  
which can be found at (http://www.tt-solutions.com/en/Products/yahoo2mbox 
).  This made all of the material much easier to wade through; whether  
I was diving in chronologically, by thread, or just searching the body  
text of all past messages (which is what it seems that you want to do).

If you search the messages for "clarinet", there are only 1000 messages. You

I would recommend starting with a radial facing curve.  I have made tips from .068" to .085" and facing lengths from 34 to 47.  A few of the smaller ones were decent for Kletzmer work.  Most just honked.
