There are several other materials that will work for a replacement.  
You can cut and shape a deck to be glued into place or cast one in 
place and shape it after the materialr sets.

Paul Coats posted some photos on the MP Works Yahoo site of the "cut, 
shape and glue" method.  He used some plastic from the side of a 
spray paint can cap.  See Photos - Brilhart Biteplate.  I have seen 
some good decks made out of a junker hard rubber or plastic 
mouthpiece.

Also see the Photos - Link Transformation.  I casted a deck out of 2-
part 3M black acrylic as part of that project.  I used electrical 
tape on the sides of the Link to create a form for the material.  You 
would not need to do that on a Guardala since the deck is located 
within a 4-sided pocket.

With either method, you need to clean out the old material.  Then 
roughen up the surface some if it is smooth.  This will help the glue 
or casted material to adhere better.

If the deck does not have a tight fit, it is a good idea to glue it 
with an epoxy that can fill the void around the edges.  Otherwise it 
may leak and hiss while you play it.

With either method you will need to do some final shaping to make the 
new surface flush with the rest of the mouthpiece.  Use files and 
sandpaper taking care not to damage the plating in the surrounding 
area.  A pocketknife blade is also useful in scraping in shaping.

If your Guardala just has a tooth gouge in the material, you do not 
need to replace it, just repair it.  Roughen it then fill it with a 
clear epoxy and shape it.

Its a good idea to use some kind of mouthpiece patch after a repair.  
It protects the repair and keeps epoxy out of your system which is 
probably bad for you in large doses.  A thin clear patch is easy to 
get used to.  I like the thick black ones.

I just worked on a Guardala Bari Sax MP that was squeaking for a 
client.  The bite plate was in perfect shape with a thin clear patch 
over it.  I inspected it closely and the pink material appears to be 
cut, shaped and glued in place.  Not a casted epoxy.

As for the squeaks, I helped as much as I could with the piece but it 
ultimately came down to the reed.  He is trying to use a vintage 
Vibrator #2 reed on the .113"/55 Guardala.  He included one so I 
could try it and it squeaks easily.  The reed has a long thick heart 
and then it is thin for the last 1/2".  This thin section just wants 
to vibrate on its own at high frequencies.  Maybe a much shorter 
facing would solve it, but this would change the personality of the 
mouthpiece too much.

I decided to send the mouthpiece back with a MS Fibracell which does 
not squeak at all.  You can easily feel between your fingers how 
different the two reed cuts are.  I think the client has a stock pile 
of the vintage reeds and uses them on other bari sax MPs.  He told 
me "these are good reeds".  Hopefully the Fibracell will illustrate 
the problem and solution.

            <pre class='message__body'>Some reeds and mouthpieces are simply incompatable.  A friend sent his 
RIA Metal bari piece for rework, along with some of his reeds, and in 
testing first, I was squeeking like crazy.  My wife came back, 
concerned.  She said, I have not heard you squeek ever, you sound like a 
beginner now. 

I tried a few of my Fibracells and could not force a chirp or squeek.  I 
am sure other reeds would have done well, too.

Sent the mouthpiece back untouched, but with a few fibracells, and the 
guy was ecstatic, it played just as he wanted.

I had seen this a lot with players at trade shows trying Runyon 
mouthpieces, various models and facings.  The old favorite reed brand 
and strength may not allow the new mouthpiece to perform its best.  Be 
prepared to change.

I am finding that fibracells work really well with a slightly longer facing
than say Rico&#39;s or Vandoren&#39;s.  On tenor I find 25mm to be a happy medium
between being cane friendly and fibracell friendly.  Has anyone else found
the same thing?

Some reeds and mouthpieces are simply incompatable.  A friend sent his RIA
Metal bari piece for rework, along with some of his reeds, and in testing
first, I was squeeking like crazy.  My wife came back, concerned.  She said,
I have not heard you squeek ever, you sound like a beginner now.  

I tried a few of my Fibracells and could not force a chirp or squeek.  I am
sure other reeds would have done well, too.

Sent the mouthpiece back untouched, but with a few fibracells, and the guy
was ecstatic, it played just as he wanted.

I had seen this a lot with players at trade shows trying Runyon mouthpieces,
various models and facings.  The old favorite reed brand and strength may
not allow the new mouthpiece to perform its best.  Be prepared to change.

I just worked on a Guardala Bari Sax MP that was squeaking for a 
client.  The bite plate was in perfect shape with a thin clear patch 
over it.  I inspected it closely and the pink material appears to be 
cut, shaped and glued in place.  Not a casted epoxy.

As for the squeaks, I helped as much as I could with the piece but it 
ultimately came down to the reed.  He is trying to use a vintage 
Vibrator #2 reed on the .113"/55 Guardala.  He included one so I 
could try it and it squeaks easily.  The reed has a long thick heart 
and then it is thin for the last 1/2".  This thin section just wants 
to vibrate on its own at high frequencies.  Maybe a much shorter 
facing would solve it, but this would change the personality of the 
mouthpiece too much.

I decided to send the mouthpiece back with a MS Fibracell which does 
not squeak at all.  You can easily feel between your fingers how 
different the two reed cuts are.  I think the client has a stock pile 
of the vintage reeds and uses them on other bari sax MPs.  He told 
me "these are good reeds".  Hopefully the Fibracell will illustrate 
the problem and solution.

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but I&#39;ve had mixed results with 
Fibracells. Just recently, I bought 6 of the new "red label Premium" 
altos reeds from WWBW and 5 "black label 1/2 strength-rated" tenor 
reeds from Charlie A.

All of the tenor reeds (2.5 and 3.0) extremely well right off the bat 
although they seemed a bit soft for their rating.

Only one of the alto reeds out of the 6 was a good player. The rest 
were either much harder than their rating or were poorly balanced 
(right side of the reed much thicker than the left). Before getting 
these new Fibracells, I&#39;d been playing through a huge box of Medium 
and Medium Hard Fibracells for alto that I bought cheap from a 
closing music store. These reeds were also horribly inconsistant. I 
was glad to find that at least 3 reeds out of the 20 played well. 
I&#39;ve been playing on those three reeds for almost a year.

The nice thing is that Fibracells seem easy to adjust, even though 
the manufacturer doesn&#39;t recommend it. I&#39;ve been able to fix 3 of the 
new "Premium" reeds by sanding down the top side of the reed in the 
appropriate spots. I&#39;m considering rigging up my depth gage to allow 
reed tickness to be "mapped out" so that I might be able to fix this 
pile of Fibracells by using measurements rather than just look and 
feel.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. It was just one of those "eurika!" 
moments when I was able to figure out how to fix a few of these 
babies. I&#39;m going to send an email to Mira about my findings to see 
how/if they respond.
