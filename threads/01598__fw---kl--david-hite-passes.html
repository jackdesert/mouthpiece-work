Subject: [kl] David Hite Passes

It is with great sadness that I am passing on the news of the death of David
Hite.

David was one of those rennaisance clarinetists who did it all. I only met
him once, but had several e-mail conversations with him over the years. He
was kind and generous and probably knew more about mouthpiece making and
acoustincs than any other current mouthpiece maker.

David was always very kind to me and encouraging. He leaves a wonderful
legacy in his many fine publications, many students and surely thousands
upon thousands of mouthpieces.
