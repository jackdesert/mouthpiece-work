            <pre class='message__body'>Just my opinion, but if whiskey is being sold at a profit, the  
musicians should be paid. Club owners have been promoting this type  
even for years in order to get free entertainment. If ANYBODY is  
getting paid, or ANY money is being made, the musicians should be  
paid. This is simply exploitation, nothing more. It&#39;s right up there  
with "showcases".

Seriously, if you support this sort of thing, don&#39;t bitch about low  
wages or lack of work for professional musicians. I don&#39;t see plumbers  
or electricians working for free so somebody else can profit from  
their labor.

If you want to get together and play, that&#39;s fine. Just don&#39;t do it at  
a venue that should be PAYING for live music!

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, 
   I am a saxophonist and have great respect for you and have always viewed you as a valuable resource in the Saxophone World.... Thanks for your reply, and for sending it to everyone. I too am sending my reply to everyone.... This is an event sponsored by our local Arts Council and is an attempt to gather musicians together in a small city where there are very few places for musicians to play. Many of our musicians only get to interact with other musicians on Sunday mornings... in church. This is not New Orleans.... We are trying to promote live music and musicianship. We asked the civic-minded supporters of the arts (who happen to own The Flying Shamrock) if we could use their space. 
We won&#39;t be mad if they make a few dollars to cover their expenses.... What the musicians gain from "jamming" with musicians of varying backgrounds and levels of ability is priceless.

We&#39;ll miss you,
Jeffrey Miles Grimes

business where so many people give their services away for free and  
allow others to profit from them. This sort of thing does a tremendous

"this is not New Orleans" really hold water. If they think they can

service that has value and should be paid accordingly. If the local  
arts council wishes to sponsor such an event, that&#39;s fine, but the  
arts council should seek and provide a venue where musicians are not  
exploited.

Making a living as a player is hard enough without this sort of thing,  
well intentioned or not. They need to consider the world of the  
professional musician, not the weekend warrior. It&#39;s a very different  
reality.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is a classic problem.  It is easily solved by having an agreement in writing with the clubowner that any money over a certain minimum will be split among the musicians and the club with an agreed upon division.  If there is any suspicion about the "count" then have two people verify it.  I know a lot of bands that work for the door, and insist they have their own person at the door.  When I worked for the door plus drink percentage, I insisted on a cash register tape, and we always had someone watch to make sure that the tape wasn&#39;t run sometime earlier during the gig, so your count would show up short.

When I used to play a regular jam in Oakland, as part of the main band, the band guys were paid, but the sitter-inners were not.  Those sitting in were limited to 3 tunes max.  

Even here, the clubowner exploited the band - the Sunday afternoon jam was often 6 or 7 hours long, but we got the same amount we did for the 9 - 1:30 sessions on Thurs, Fri and Sat.  They served a lot of alcohol at those jams...

Remember what the road to hell is paved with...

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Jam Sessions</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>The real root of the problem is not just the exploitation of musicians  
by  club owners who don&#39;t want to pay a dime they don&#39;t have to, it&#39;s  
amateur musicians who want to live out their fantasy while taking work  
away from people who are trying to make a living. If the amateur in  
question works a day job as, say, a plumber, I would suspect they  
would strongly object to somebody going around fixing pipes for free.  
The solution is a dedicated venue for amateurs only, no liquor sold,  
where there is no competition with people who are trying to make a  
full time living. They could then play and jam to their heart&#39;s  
content, without hurting the people who are in the business full time.  
Music attracts a lot of part-timers, who probably couldn&#39;t make a full  
time living as players. This is not allowed in most professions, and  
should not be in music. I think it&#39;s perfectly OK for the amateurs to  
get together and play, so long as they don&#39;t interfere with the  
livelihood of the people who actually make the industry possible: the  
full time professional players.

Since when, in this gloriously free country of ours, did it become a crime
for an amateur to want to have a venue to play music.just for fun?  If I
participate in a jam session, I&#39;m probably having my fair share of whiskey,
or other beverage of choice, too.  The "entertainment" is as much for my

And as for that casual listener, they can clearly see the difference in
quality between a performing pro and the amateur hack like myself.  They too
are getting what they pay for.  The club owner who risks his or her capital
to provide such a venue, who BTW may or may not serve more covers and
generate more profit by doing so vs. a pay for music business model, still
deserves to get paid.  All constituents involved are big boys and girls and
know what they are participating in.

 

For the pro musician to suggest that jam sessions are "harming" them
financially by stealing gigs away is somewhat akin to my beloved Carolina
Hurricanes professional hockey team suggesting that the local ice rink is
harming their business by allowing the amateur to play hockey in a
recreational league.  To that I would say, give me a break.

            <pre class='message__body'>No disrespect, but at one point (many, many moons ago) I did.  It&#39;s been a long time though so that&#39;s why I consider myself a hack amateur today.  And, I will keep my day job thank you very much.  I bet you will too.  It pays the bills!  :-)

There are a fair number of "pros" that couldn&#39;t carry a tune in a bucket.  But I don&#39;t believe that to be the case in the VAST majority of instances.  Those guys and gals (the majority of pros that is) are at a different level.

Put a different way, I don&#39;t see myself as "competing" against a pro musician.  They play to a market, one that the amateur doesn&#39;t have access to.  Nor would their audience tolerate paying to see me play (these days anyways) trust me on that one.  We are targeting dramatically different markets.  Using my prior analogy, the person that would spend $100 to go see a Hurricanes game wouldn&#39;t spend $.10 to see an amateur play in the rec league.  So goes the music biz.

So don&#39;t kid yourself into thinking that the pros and amateurs compete...because, not unlike the Bon Fils vs. your pro line horns, they do not.

Again, no disrespect, just a different opinion.

            <pre class='message__body'>I often go to a pub where there are Sunday lunchtime jam sessions. That is
what they are advertised as and that is what the audience expect. As far as
the players are concerned, it is as much a social function as a performance
function. The players are for the most part amateurs and do not expect
payment. The resident band are professionals and they get whatever is agreed
with the management, but they&#39;re not there on Sunday. The Sunday sit-ins are
there for fun. Certainly the management are making money, but they are also
paying the insurance and running costs and providing the venue. There are a
hard core of good amateur players who form the centre of the Sunday
sessions, and while they may be part-timers, they actually play better than
some bands I&#39;ve paid good money to see. For the rest of the week,
performances at this venue are professional, paid performances but Sunday
afternoon is the amateurs playtime. Some of these amateurs go on to become
pro musos, but this is where they cut their teeth. This is where music
lives.

            <pre class='message__body'>Our community band was never allowed to play in the city concert on the square series.  Our understanding was that they felt that scheduling an amateur group was "taking jobs away from union musicians."  They finally did have us play for two years, but not again this year.  They also do not invite us to participate in celebrations for the 4th of July, etc.  It is their loss, I figure, since we work really cheap.  It seems silly to us.  We DO play a major concert in a neighboring town every summer, and for annual Memorial Day observances at the American Legion hall in another neighboring town where we are appreciated for what we are.
