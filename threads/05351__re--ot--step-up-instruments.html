  You can definitely find some great old horns out there.  Also, old horns doesn&#39;t have to mean 1950 and earlier.  There are lots of horns from the 50&#39;s, 60&#39;s and even the 70&#39;s that are good options.
   
  I do understand that there&#39;s nothing like the "wow factor" of a brand new horn, and that kids can be judgmental and cruel, but during my days fixing horns, there were many of the older horns that had a great sound and better than average intonation throughout the horn!  And they were built solid, not needing adjustment every couple of months!
   
  But the trick is educating yourself on which model and years were the better versions of the horns...

Thanks to everyone who responded both on and off list.  As I suspected would 
happen, the parents spoke to the band directors and they of course said "Get 
a Selmer SA80II."  Which is overkill for most high schoolers and even more

Now if I can just get them to adopt me.  :-)

I second the vintage horn route...  even some of the old Bundy&#39;s are better 
than many of the step up horns that we are seeing these days, rugged and 
durable!

;-)

I play a Selmer CT, Leblanc LL and Leblanc Symphonie 3 clarinet.  
Buying a clarinet (or anything else) new just doesn&#39;t fit the pocket 
book anymore. My last new horn was my Selmer mk VII alto back in 
1979ish
