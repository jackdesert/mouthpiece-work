            <pre class='message__body'>You&#39;re preaching to the choir here.  My alto and my (now sold) tenor are 
both Selmer Mark VII&#39;s, my flute is a mid-1970&#39;s Haynes, and my E-flat 
clarinet is 1695 Selmer.

Thanks to everyone who responded both on and off list.  As I suspected would 
happen, the parents spoke to the band directors and they of course said "Get 
a Selmer SA80II."  Which is overkill for most high schoolers and even more 
so for this student who is only going into 7th grade.

Now if I can just get them to adopt me.  :-)

            <pre class='message__body'>Daniel,

a 1695 Selmer .. i&#39;ve heard of vintage but that takes the cake !! 
;-)

I play a Selmer CT, Leblanc LL and Leblanc Symphonie 3 clarinet.  
Buying a clarinet (or anything else) new just doesn&#39;t fit the pocket 
book anymore. My last new horn was my Selmer mk VII alto back in 
1979ish
