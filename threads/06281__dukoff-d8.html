I have just finished a Dukoff tenor D8 with an eliptical curve +3 and 
1/2. The bottom end is great but the top end is a little thin. I have 
taken the chamber out like a Guardala and I can&#39;t take the baffle down 
any further. There is a very slight hint of the bite plate showing

Would a radial curve with more room under the reed at the table end of

Just an idea for how to salvage this piece, where Ross can&#39;t remove any more
baffle near the tip:

How thick is the bite plate? (I don&#39;t have one of these to look at.)

Couldn&#39;t Ross build up the bite-plate notch with something like JB Weld, so
that he can take the baffle down further. Or even fill the entire bite-plate

            <pre class='message__body'>On metal Links and Ponzols, the top of the beak has a notch about 1mm deep
for the bite plate.

 I have a Link that is in similar condition to Ross&#39;s (where the bite plate
is starting to show where the baffle has been filed, but it needs more work)
and I&#39;ve been wondering what to do in order to salvage it.

Granted that brass is stronger than pewter, otherwise a similar situation,
no?

I haven&#39;t tried anything yet. I&#39;ve considered the following:

I could bond a bite plate made of sheet copper or brass to the beak, thick
enough to be flush with the rest of the mouthpiece. This would strengthen
the beak and provide some cutting space. After this, however, I would have
to use a mouthpiece patch on the piece, though, to avoid teeth-on-metal.

Additionally, why not build up the *entire top of the beak* by 1-2 mm with
either sheet copper, brass. While this might thicken the mouthpiece beak a
little,  it beats tossing the piece.

A new feature: "laminated beak".

And btw, is a Link solid, or is it two halves that have been soldered?

I.e., would it fall apart if heated suffiently.  I&#39;m thinking about dental
grade silver solder.

With respect to Ross, what is the situation with soldering a Dukoff
(pewter)?  Would the piece melt before getting hot enough to solder?

I took off enough baffle to expose the underside of the biteplate. I don't
think playability was affected, they play great. I'm talking about a couple of
small triangular spots, not a big swath of plastic showing.

side and sent it off to have it gold plated.  You can&#39;t tell it was

I think soft solder would work on the dukoff and it should blend in
pretty well if you scuff it up a little with sandpaper.

On metal Links and Ponzols, the top of the beak has a notch about 1mm deep
for the bite plate.

 I have a Link that is in similar condition to Ross&#39;s (where the bite plate
is starting to show where the baffle has been filed, but it needs more work)
and I&#39;ve been wondering what to do in order to salvage it.

Granted that brass is stronger than pewter, otherwise a similar situation,
no?

I haven&#39;t tried anything yet. I&#39;ve considered the following:

I could bond a bite plate made of sheet copper or brass to the beak, thick
enough to be flush with the rest of the mouthpiece. This would strengthen
the beak and provide some cutting space. After this, however, I would have
to use a mouthpiece patch on the piece, though, to avoid teeth-on-metal.

Additionally, why not build up the *entire top of the beak* by 1-2 mm with
either sheet copper, brass. While this might thicken the mouthpiece beak a
little,  it beats tossing the piece.

A new feature: "laminated beak".

And btw, is a Link solid, or is it two halves that have been soldered?

I.e., would it fall apart if heated suffiently.  I&#39;m thinking about dental
grade silver solder.

With respect to Ross, what is the situation with soldering a Dukoff
(pewter)?  Would the piece melt before getting hot enough to solder?

   I have just finished a Dukoff tenor D8 with an eliptical curve +3 and 
1/2. The bottom end is great but the top end is a little thin. I have 
taken the chamber out like a Guardala and I can&#39;t take the baffle down 
any further. There is a very slight hint of the bite plate showing

Would a radial curve with more room under the reed at the table end of 
the reed give more fatter sound? Would it also reduce the back 
pressure a little? I would like this piece to be free flowing.
Hope that somebody can help.
