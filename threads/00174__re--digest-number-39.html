            <pre class='message__body'>Phil, I had read something somewhere, about Links, that way way back
they were sandcast.  I would be surprised if they were still made that
way.

Yes, more than anything, a manufacturer needs sample to sample
consistency in order to maintain a reputation for quality.  A guy needs
to know, if I try my friend&#39;s SuperSax special, and I order one, will it
play the same?  You can&#39;t have a customer going through a dozen samples
to find the one good one.  They ALL have to be good.  The player
deserves nothing less.
