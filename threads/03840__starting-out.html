really interesting, but all of this stuff seems like a buch of 
gobbledy-gook. Where do I start. Where do I find the basic 
information. I dont mean like the names of the parts ofr the 
mouthpeice and stuff. I am tralking about what do  I need to know to

            <pre class='message__body'>Welcome aboard, Zach.

One of the first things to look at, in the archives, is a paper by Santy 
Runyon about Clarinet mouthpieces.  This was a series of articles the 
explain how facings, baffles, chambers, etc, all affect tone and 
response.  This applies as well to saxophone.  In case you don&#39;t locate 
it, I will email it directly to you.
