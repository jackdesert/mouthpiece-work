            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys,

I wanted to ask your opinion on a Meyer NY baritone mouthpiece that I own. Most NY Meyers for bari I&#39;ve seen have that slim shape; but the one I own is a fat/ standard bari mouthpiece shape. Also I noticed the hard rubber on the fat looking one is much better quality than the slim looking ones. Also the slim looking ones have a straight  baffle and floor, the fat looking one has a roll over baffle with a round concave floor. The fat looking one is a killer, the other ones are OK.
Any idea if the slim ones are only a later issue maybe after 60&#39;s and the fater looking one is maybe an early 50&#39;s. Any info on this would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Gabriel Vatavu
