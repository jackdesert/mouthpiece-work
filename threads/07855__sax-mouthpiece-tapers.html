The more common practice with today&#39;s mouthpieces that have a cylindrical shank is to sand the neck cork in such a way as to make the tapered end of the neck into a cylinder that matches.

Using this method, the mouthpiece is snug on the cork regardless of the placement (within reason) and there are no gaps between the cork and the interior of the mouthpiece shank.

In actual practice all the sax mouthpieces I see tend to be parallel or very nearly so (within a few thou.) so that with a parallel cork I can get a good smooth fit.
With a taper the fit will only be good in one position.

If the mouthpiece bore and the cork are both tapered then a smooth fit for tuning becomes very difficult. As the mouthpiece is pushed on it will get progressively tighter (and vice versa).
In actual practice all the sax mouthpieces I see tend to be parallel or very nearly so (within a few thou.) so that with a parallel cork I can get a good smooth fit.

Bill and others, the taper in the bore actually has to do with molding the mouthpiece.  It is necessary to have a very slight taper in order to withdraw the bore die, for the same reason rifle cartridges have a slight taper, rather than straight walls, in semiauto and full auto types.
