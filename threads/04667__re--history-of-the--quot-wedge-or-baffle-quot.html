  A Link modified with a baffle insert (also called a "wedge") can project 
  very well, and still have nice full low notes. Same idea as the Runyon
  mouthpieces with the "spoiler" - only IMO it&#39;s not the spoiler that makes
  the big difference but the wedge shaped baffle insert.

  It&#39;s not necessary that such an insert be permanent. (Although there&#39;s a
  good example of a permanent baffle alteration on a Link done by Mojo in the
  picture files, IIRC.)

  Usually a baffle insert can be wedged firmly into place if properly fitted,
  but easily popped out.

            <pre class='message__body'>Lars, you might find this interesting, too...  First an email from Santy Runyon to me about his first mouthpiece design, and then an excerpt from an article about him.  Read below.
   
  Paul Coats
   
  Dear Paul: It&#39;s going to take a long story to tell what I played before.  It was a red hard rubber mouthpiece, that had a metal inserted facing on it. (Paul&#39;s note:  I have just acquired an old Holton that fits this description.)
   
  And it was this mouthpiece that I filled in somewhat with the chewing gum in order to make it play like I liked.  It had the airplane curve on the inside.   Every place where I played they couldn&#39;t understand how I got the sound. And I wouldn&#39;t let anybody look inside.  -NO Wwway.
   
  When I got to Chicago Verne Buck wanted to straighten the facing for me ..  Again NO way. The next day after a Jam session there were four sax men in Lyons Band Instrument Company trying mouthpieces.
   
  I played it with Henry Busse at the Chez Paree in Chicago, and part of the time in the Chicago Theatre.  I designed an alto mouthpiece for J.J. Babbit, which was pretty good after I worked on the tone chamber, and I played it with fair success for  a while.  Then, after that, I had molds made for my Custom alto.  We still have the cores and the mold for that piece.  Has about the same as the chewing gum but it looks a little better, and it really does play better than the original.
 
Arnold (Brilhart) made a pretty good mouthpiece.  It looked pretty, and by working on it I could make it play pretty good. Not good enough for me to play in the Chicago Theatre, however.  Arnold would not sell them to me direct.  He had an exlusive with Lyons Band Instrument Company.
   
  So I started making them myself.  That was in about 1938 or 9.  Made a bari at the same time, and the first one we sold was to Bruce Bronson with Tommy&#39;s (Dorsey&#39;s) Band.  The arranger, after hearing the broadcast, called up and said "what happened to the sax section, I could hear the bari for the first time."
   
  Long story, Paul, I have more if you think you can stand it.
   
  Warmest Regards,
Santy
   
  And this article by Reese Fuller, staff writer at the Times of Acadiana, based on an interview with Santy Runyon:
   
   
  When he was 11, he read about the Bernoulli Effect and how it applied to aviation.   Bernoulli, a 16th century Swiss scientist, observed that when air flowed horizontally, an increase in the speed of the flow resulted in a decrease in the static pressure.  In other words, when air moves faster it exerts less pressure than slower moving air.
   
  The Bernoulli Effect would later be used in designing the airfoil of airplanes.  The shape of an airplane wing is designed so that air flowing over the wing travels faster than the air flowing under the wing, which means there is less pressure on the top than on the bottom of the wing.  The increased pressure on the bottom of the plane creates lift, allowing it to leave the ground.
   
  Runyon wondered how the effect might affect his horn.  He took a piece of chewing gum, shaped it into a small hump resembling a miniature version of the top portion of an airfoil and placed it within the mouthpiece of his sax.  The slight hump increased the flow of air going through the mouthpiece and made the instrument louder.  For years, he closely guarded the secret of his chewing gum-modified mouthpiece.
