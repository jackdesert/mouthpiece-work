            <pre class='message__body'>It seems like the group (messages) is randomly unavailable.  Anyone 
know why this is?  It&#39;s happened three times in the last three days.

Also, the "go to message #" doodad is broken.  I get some python error 
when I try to use it.

Who do I complain to at Yahoo?

By the way, I have now read 4,197 posts.  Thanks, Keith and Paul and 
others for all the information.

Now it&#39;s time to see what I can do.

            <pre class='message__body'>We are all guests of Yahoo.  I can configure a few options and add content,
but I can not trouble-shoot problems with the site.  You can try
complaining to Yahoo.  We have had very few site problems over the years.
