            <pre class='message__body'>mates, a new "vintage" otto link 6* hard rubber, tenor arrived today and it plays pretty good right out of the box. But here&#39;s the issue: the shape of the tip is overly round such that if you bring the tip of the reed to the tip of the mpc, the side tips of the reed extend measurably beyond the tip of the bit (mpc.) if you back down the reed so that the side tips are even with the sides of the tip rails, the tip is exposed by ~3/32nds.  Is this just an "as built" issue or by design. If you think it would be helpful I could upload a photo to show you what I mean.  I have never seen this only any other bit. best, mike

            <pre class='message__body'>Usually the table isn&#39;t flat.  It could be opened and have the table 
flattened.  The process would increase the size of the tip rail.  A 
combination of inner and outer tip work is used to shape the tip closer 
to the reed.  The natural tendency of the refacing process, mine anyway, 
is to increase this hump in the tip as you are working on the MPC.  I am 
always having to make an extra effort to stop it from happening.  That 
said, a very little bit of reed hanging over can be OK.

You could also, if you just wanted to go darker, flatten the tip on the 
edge of a piece of sand paper.  It&#39;s tough to get very far doing just 
one thing because everything is interconnected.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hal, 

Everything you say sounds right to me. I was really wondering if the designers at otto link actually intended such a propounced "hump" in the tip.  the side rails are different thickness, the right rail thinner.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah most of them seem to be like this. God knows what reeds they expect people to be playing that are shaped like this.  FWIW I reshape the tip to a normal curve when I do these.
