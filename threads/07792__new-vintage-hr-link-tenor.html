            <pre class='message__body'>Usually the table isn&#39;t flat.  It could be opened and have the table 
flattened.  The process would increase the size of the tip rail.  A 
combination of inner and outer tip work is used to shape the tip closer

You could also, if you just wanted to go darker, flatten the tip on the

one thing because everything is interconnected.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hal, 

Everything you say sounds right to me. I was really wondering if the designers at otto link actually intended such a propounced "hump" in the tip.  the side rails are different thickness, the right rail thinner.

  Usually the table isn&#39;t flat. It could be opened and have the table 
  flattened. The process would increase the size of the tip rail. A 
  combination of inner and outer tip work is used to shape the tip closer 
  to the reed. The natural tendency of the refacing process, mine anyway, 
  is to increase this hump in the tip as you are working on the MPC. I am 
  always having to make an extra effort to stop it from happening. That 
  said, a very little bit of reed hanging over can be OK.

  You could also, if you just wanted to go darker, flatten the tip on the 
  edge of a piece of sand paper. It&#39;s tough to get very far doing just 
  one thing because everything is interconnected.
