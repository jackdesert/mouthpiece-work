            <pre class='message__body'>Pretty straight forward. I want to open a very closed piece to what feels most comfortable to me. How do you open up a piece? Also, for interests sake, how do you close a very open piece to a very small opening? My initial guess would be to continually cut down and flatten the table but this would thicken side rails, and when the side rails are thinned out again, you end up with a bigger window.

Pretty straight forward. I want to open a very closed piece to what feels most comfortable to me. How do you open up a piece? Also, for interests sake, how do you close a very open piece to a very small opening? My initial guess would be to continually cut down and flatten the table but this would thicken side rails, and when the side rails are thinned out again, you end up with a bigger window.

If you close a mouthpiece the rails do get wider but that is on the outer side.  You can just narrow the rails from the outside with a file.  ie  Closing the facing will not make the window narrower.
