            <pre class='message__body'>  I was just wondering what some good tools (preferably inexpensive
ones :D) would be, and maybe where i could pick them up, for an
absolute beginner to get started refacing mouthpieces.  I of course
would only start on junk mouthpieces.  I just wanted to start getting
into learning how to do it.  You all seem very helpful and i&#39;m glad i
stumbled upon this group.  Thanks

Go to the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site and read the home page.  It tells you where to look for tool lists and other info on the site.
