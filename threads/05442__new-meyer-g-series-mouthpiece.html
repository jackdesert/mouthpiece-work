I have been trying out and logging the dimensions on dozens of
mouthpieces lately in hopes of increasing my knowledge of measurements
vs. actually sound results.  I was wondering if anyone had dealt with
these new Meyer G Series alto pieces.  Meyer describes them as a
closer connection to the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s alto sound.  I have yet to get
my hands on a 50&#39;s Meyer due to the cost and was wondering if anyone
had compared the dimensions/sound characteristics/chamber volume of
the G series to a classic Meyer. Or if anyone has volume or
chamber/throat dimensions from a 50&#39;s era Meyer alto 5M, would you be
willing to share those measurements?  Im sure there is no comparison,
but was curious as to Meyer&#39;s (babbitt&#39;s) claims.

            <pre class='message__body'>-The 50&#39;s-60&#39;s sound that they are talking about is not the Meyer 
mouthpiece sound but an attempt to replicate the "Gregory" 
mouthpiece sound of that era. I am currently playing on one of these 
and love it. Great intonation, terrific range of tone colours...but 
having tried several they do vary considerably one fron another. I 
like the nice balance between fullness of sound and edge when you 
need it. 
Hope this helps,
James
