            <pre class='message__body'>What rotary tool's has a flex shaft that fits into the mouthpiece shank?  My dremel shaft is too fat to get into the bore from the shank end... looking for something that fits.

Thanks
David.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use a MicroMark #14260 flex shaft in a Weller rotary tool.  It looks like MicroMark has discontinued it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dremel makes (or made) a professional motor with shaft and interchangeable handpieces - it was quite expensive though. About 10 years ago I purchased a n almost identical copy sold by Axminster tools which works great and has speeds from 0 - 20,000.
 It is a far east copy that I am sure would be available world-wide under stencil names.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a micromotor handpiece that is narrow enough to fit about an inch deep. Says "Super" on it. Inexpensive (<Â£200) power supply and motor in the handpiece. Still need long bits in it if you want to get up to the throat from the shank. All the Foredom handpieces seem to be too wide. I use grinding points with very long shanks and go in from the front.</pre>
