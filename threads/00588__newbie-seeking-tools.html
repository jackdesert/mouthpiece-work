            <pre class='message__body'>Okay,

This must be one that lots of folks ask when they joining up. I have zero
experience and knowledge, but hope all that will change.

What tools does one need to make/reface sax mouthpieces in their common
materials? Where might these tools be obtained, and what literature should
one look for?

Minilathe? Ferron book? File sets?

Regards to everyone,

Wally Moore

            <pre class='message__body'>One of the nice things about setting up this group on Yahoo is that all our
old posts are saved.  You will find a wealth of discussion on basic tools
that are recommended and additional tools that help too.  I recommend you
skim read them all or do a Search for tools.

There is also areas for Photos, Files and Links to other sites of interest.
 The Files area has some extensive lists of tools and suppliers.

In my opinion, obtaining measurement tools is the first step.  I spent 3
months (off and on) measuring and recording every piece I could get my
hands on.  I then went back and re-measured some.  This showed how my
measurment technique had improved.  You need to get fairly repeatable
results or you will not be able to guide your work with your measurements.

It is worth asking - do we have someone doing an off-yahoo archive of the
site?

As pay no money, but get our site in exchange for the ads, there is a risk
that things could get lost.

Might be a goodly idea to back it up?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for bringing up the subject!  I think I have all the non-message
stuff but I definately do not have the messages backed up.  I&#39;ll work
towards getting a copies of all the old messages.

I&#39;ll also start storing away a Daily Digest.

            <pre class='message__body'>Looks like it took a couple of days for this mailing list stuff to start
showing up in my email.

I went back to the site and found all the resources you&#39;ve put up, and am
perusing the messages (slowly). Wish there were a way to batch &#39;em together
into a single big text file for download.

This is yet another forum where I&#39;d better just start buying tools,
practicing the techniques, and keep my mouth shut until I have something
useful to say or ask about. Hopefully I&#39;ll be up to speed soon.

Best wishes to all.

If you are reading an earlier post and you have a question that is 
not answered in the next few posts, be sure to ask about it.  I think 
some of the earlier posts could use some additional clarification.  
Enjoy.

I&#39;ll keep a copy on my home PC and I&#39;ll put a copy in the Files area

            <pre class='message__body'>I have copied and saved the first 300 messages so far in groups of 
25.  They are in the Files - Grouped Posts area if anyone would like 
their own archival copies.  This represents half of our posts so far.

This will also serve as a fast way for a new visitor/member to scan 
through all the earlier posts to get up to speed.
