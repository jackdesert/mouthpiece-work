I&#39;m not sure how to change your email address on the Yahoo group. You should be able to edit it, or delete it and rejoin.

Sign into this yahoo groups actual site, and near the top, in blue, you will see "Edit membership".  Click that.

Step 1, you designate which email address you wish to use.  Under that, in blue it says "Add new email address".  Click that.

And once that is done, check that choice of email addresses to send your digests.

Go to the bottom of the page and click the big blue Save Changes button.

Easy!

Mike, I moderate 5 saxophone oriented yahoo groups, another sax forum, 1 ham radio yahoo group, 1 model railroad forum, and a few more.  Also, I am a member of about 25 or 30 musical, ham radio, stereo, and model railroading yahoo groups.  You pick up a few tricks doing that... haha.

For example, member will send a note to the group, "Unsubscribe".  For yahoo groups, like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz who just wanted to go home, that was always in her power.  At the bottom of Edit Membership page, there is a "Leave the Group" button to click.  

But when you dig further, "why are you leaving the group?" you find out that the member&#39;s real complaint is "getting too many emails".  Is that all?  Then he can go to the Edit Membership page, select that he wants to receive them not as individual emails for each post, but a "Daily Digest".  That is all of the posts for a certain period or number of posts.  The third option is "web only", so that the member goes to the yahoo groups messages page to read posts rather than having them emailed to him.  

All of that is available to the member, and he has control over it himself, right on that Edit Membership page.  And this can be set up differently for each of the groups a person belongs to.

Paul

            <pre class='message__body'>These were patterned after several cane reeds I had on hand.  The sides do taper from the tip widths I measured to the butt widths I measured.
