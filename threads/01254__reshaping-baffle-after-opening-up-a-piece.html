            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Again, gang,

I&#39;ve been working on a few Meyer 5M&#39;s for some students of mine - 
mostly just flattening the tables and evening the rails (I am 
increasingly blown away by the inconsistencies with mass produced 
mouthpieces - some of them don&#39;t even play at all - or squeek 
horrendously - and are being foisted on to the unsuspecting public 
for about $80/ea retail!)

But, I digress... getting back to my original point...
I am also opening one up a little, and then re-working the first 1/4 
inch or so of baffle - and simultaneously narrowing the tip rail.

I am using several different files - experimenting with them, really, 
to see which gives the best results: 
1) a half-round file that is about 3/4 inch wide, and tapers to a 
point;
2) a round needle file (the diameter is less than 1/4 inch); and
3) a flat need file - about 1/4 inch wide (I can&#39;t take exact 
measurements as I&#39;m at work, and they&#39;re at home.

Here&#39;s my experience so far:
The flat needle file when used near the tip - tends to take material 
off at the edges of the file - I don&#39;t like to use it near the tip.

The round need file can have a tendency to create a groove if I&#39;m not 
careful: if I use too much pressure, or if I go back and forth, 
rather than in a circular motion.

The larger 1/2 round file (which I bought at Davidson&#39;s Jeweler&#39;s 
Supply on the web), works pretty well, but seems to be a little too 
big for this kind of work, even at the narrow point. The curved side 
of the file is too convex (if that makes sense).

It seems to me that the best sized file would be a half-round file of 
about 1/2 width, that was only very slightly convex on the "round" 
side.

I&#39;m wondering what others use for this type of work - specifically 
the size of the files (and the "grit", tho I know that&#39;s not the 
right word). I remember Paul suggesting to use a circular motion, 
which is what I&#39;ve been trying to do - with good lighting and 
magnification.

Any thoughts, experiences, tips, suggestions, successes, failures, 
etc. would be appreciated.

BTW - have I mentioned that I think this group is great?!?!

Thanks,
Pete

            <pre class='message__body'>I used to mostly use a 1/4" wide, half-round file that tapers to a point. 
This is a med-coarse or course needle file.

Lately I&#39;ve been using a 1/8" x 1/8" wide metal file more.  Its a finer
cut, so it loads up sooner.  But since it has 4 cutting surfaces, I just
flip it as I use it.  This file is especially good for soprano and alto tip
rails.

I also use pocket knife blades to scrape material.  I even use them on
brass.  I have a small flat blade and a small curved blade I like from an
old Boy Scout Whittler&#39;s knife.

I wrap sandpaper around the files and also a white plastic stick intended
for spreading glue. Its about 1/8" in diameter with one end flattened.  It
is also a good tool for working steel wool inside small mouthpieces.
