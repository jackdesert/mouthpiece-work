Looks great Morgan.   How may axis of motion?  Do you need to start with square bar billets (as opposed to round rod) for work holding stability?

Thanks Matt.  As far as distribution (aside from direct), they&#39;re in one of the shops over here and will be in more soon.  Working on a couple of things for the States but nothing in concrete yet.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah, square billets moves workholding from very difficult to trivial.  A lot more waste when it comes to the rubber pieces (need to square oversized rounds), but worth it.  

Only 3 axes of motion.  Takes more setups but a lot less machine.  I suppose if you had a lathe with a bar feeder, 2 spindles and an A axis you could run them all night long.  You&#39;d never make enough mouthpieces to pay for it....

REALLY close!  The general character is quite similar.  The HR piece sounds
a little more fluffy.  He&#39;s playing a little less aggressively though.

I really like the aesthetic of the metal piece in particular.  Bravo!

            <pre class='message__body'>Great audio demos Morgan.  Some of the best I&#39;ve heard and I&#39;m sure the investment was mostly in compensating the excellent players.  They do your craftsmanship and design expertise justice and that means, onward and upward....

            <pre class='message__body'>The CAD model of the chamber is the same, but I finish the HR a little differently.  Sure, Dave&#39;s playing it less aggressively, but everyone who picks one up seems to do that, even when the dimensions are all the same.  People just seem to want to ply HR a little warmer, a little more fluffy, than metal.  So a little bit different treatment in the hand finishing brings those differences out a little.

            <pre class='message__body'>Cheers Lance.  I&#39;m really happy with how they sound as well.  I think I&#39;m very fortunate to know generous people who like my work and are smokin players with their own studios.
