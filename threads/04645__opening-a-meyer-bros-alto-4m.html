            <pre class='message__body'>This is a report I sent a client on a recent job.  This piece was 
perfect at a 4M but the client insisted he wanted to try it as a 5M.  
I cautioned that reworked Meyers often loose their value.  But this 
worked out so nice you can not tell I worked on it except for my MOJO 
signature, which he said was OK to put on:

I got the Meyer done last night.  I opened the tip by
angling the table.  It is more work to do it this way,
but it totally preserves the original tip rail and
baffle in the tip area.  I just took some light
strokes to dress up the tiny nicks in the tip rail.  I
also smoothed out the teeth scratches on the beak.  I
did not go after the ligature scratches since this
would have done more harm than good.

This piece was a perfect candidate for using this
technique.   The tip was great and the table was
narrower than a reed away from the tip at the butt
end.  I lowered the butt end about .022".  This angles
the reed tip away from the mouthpiece tip .007" needed
to get to the tip target.  The table got wider at the
butt end, but is still narrower than a reed so I did not
need to trim the mouthpiece sides.  

Since I took material off the table, your ligatures
will fit a little looser.  But I did not notice any
problem when testing with my Optimum Lig.

I am confident that I have increased the value of this
piece.  It was great before, but 5Ms fetch more than
4Ms.  I hope it meets your needs as a player.
