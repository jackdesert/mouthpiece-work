We&#39;ve got the final edit done. I&#39;m now ready to start taking advance orders. We&#39;ll ship in about 30 days (maybe less). VHS only at this time. $100 + $5 S/H. Pay Pal and all major forms of plastic money accepted (that&#39;s new for us. I&#39;ve finally decided to join the rest of the 21st century and take credit cards). Email me privately
