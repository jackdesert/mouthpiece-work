            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

I&#39;ve been a member for a while and have been reading the helpful posts
that you all provide and trying to learn as much as possible. 
However, I&#39;m having a problem as far as the process for opening a
mouthpiece.  I don&#39;t know what to look for to make it easier for
myself and remove as little material as possible while doing this. 
Basically, I need all info concerning this topic.

Thanks

Josh

            <pre class='message__body'>Do you have gages?  Have you measured some facing curves?  Have you read

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, 

Thank you for your reply.  To answer your questions:
Yes.  I&#39;ve gotten the morgan set.  I have measured
facing curves and read a lot of the material here. 
I&#39;ve also successfully(though not consistantly) been
able to flatten a table and apply a facing curve to
the mouthpiece.  I just ran out of mouthpieces to work
on, which were 11 assorted clarinet and saxophone
mouthpieces.  I am very new to this and any help would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Josh

            <pre class='message__body'>OK.  More specifically, have you read "Dan Torosian MPWork recap.doc" and
"Mojo on Reworking Steps.doc"?  Have you applied the suggestions to the 11
mouthpieces you have worked on?  Do any of them play well?

Not everyone will be able to be successfull mouthpiece work.  It can be
taught to some degree.  But one needs to be able to determine where a
mouthpiece is at, where you want to take it to, and then how you are going
to get it there.  Then you need to be able to execute the modification
plan.  There are many steps along the way where you need to evaluate where
you are and and what you need to do next.  These are the building blocks
that need to be developed.

Can you narrow it down to which steps are causing you the most trouble?
