            <pre class='message__body'>I have never heard of Meyer making a "*" series of their mpcs anytime within the past 30 years of the production of their mpcs, but then again maybe they did way back when... I&#39;m pretty sure that, at least since the NY-USA all the way up until now, they&#39;ve never made "*" sized pieces. 
Maybe he used to have a Link for his alto? Those do come in "*" sizes as you probably know already.
As someone else mentioned, .081" is a Meyer 7 according to their charts, but the difference between 2 or 3 thousandths of an inch (in my experiences) is pretty subtle on the tip opening for most sax mpcs. I&#39;m sure .080" will be fine for him if he wanted a "6*" Meyer.

As far as I know, Brilhart used the * to indicate same tip opening, but short facing.

Link used the * to indicate a half size.

Lakey used the * like a separator, a hyphen, between numbers indicating tip and chamber.

Couf sopranos had a *.  These Couf soprano mouthpieces were Runyon Customs, and had the same tip openings, but longer facings as per Couf.  So, a Couf soprano 6* had the same tip opening, .055", as a Runyon Custom 6, but with longer 19 mm facing versus the Runyon&#39;s 16 mm facing length.

I know of no use of the * on Meyers.
