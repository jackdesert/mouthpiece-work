            <pre class='message__body'>Hello Mouthpiece world,

Being more of a player and mouthpiece "tweaker", and of course obsessive "purchaser", I&#39;m not so up on what has happened with production in the last 10 years.  I&#39;ve seen "CNC" in so many new brands, often with "hand finished" attached to it.  I&#39;m wondering what type of CNC machines are used in these; whether they are shipped out to big factory settings to replicate a design, or whether these machines are actually directly used by the mouthpiece "maker"  with a less extravagant version of this.  

I know some like Wannes and Drakes play more like hand finished pieces.

There is a mixture of both going on.  New CNC mouthpiece designs may be typically sent out to large machine shops for prototypes and initial production runs.  If a new bisiness takes off, they may invest in their own CNC machine (s).

Early CNC Wannes had indications of some hand finishing on them.  All the current ones I have seen look 100% CNC made.  

Looks like Jody Jazz purcahsed their first CNC machine last year.  Probably to start making DVs in-house.

Hello Mouthpiece world,

Being more of a player and mouthpiece "tweaker", and of course obsessive "purchaser", I&#39;m not so up on what has happened with production in the last 10 years. I&#39;ve seen "CNC" in so many new brands, often with "hand finished" attached to it. I&#39;m wondering what type of CNC machines are used in these; whether they are shipped out to big factory settings to replicate a design, or whether these machines are actually directly used by the mouthpiece "maker" with a less extravagant version of this.
