        The deep machining marks across the table and rails reminds me about the worst mouthpiece I have ever seen,
        a Wolfe Tayne baritone mouthpiece.  This mouthpiece also had a very short facing meeting the table
        with a sharp angle.  I had to remove a lot off metal to remove the machining marks. Afterwards I had it plated in silver,
        20 microns thick , at a lower than normal current density which leaves a harder layer of silver to last longer.
