            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys,
What are you using to measure the tip oppening on a mouthpiece that&#39;s 
bigger than 280 (2.8mm ). I&#39;m using the Morgan measuring kit. I don&#39;t 
think the digital calliper would give you the same measurements, for 
some reason. I tryed measuring tip oppenings that ware less than 280 
with the morgan gauge, and again with the callipers and got a different 
reading on the callipers.

Any ideas?
Thanks all !

            <pre class='message__body'>There are several methods for measuring the tip opening shown in the Photos section on the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site.  But we do not have a picture using a wand gage.  I also have pictures on my site using calipers and a machinists&#39; depth gage.

You should be able to use your calipers to check your Morgan wand gage.  Wand gages are often inaccurate.  Either they are made wrong or are worn.

You can check your calipers using a gage block.
