            <pre class='message__body'>Hi group,

This may be old news by now, but I just got a message ostensibly from kwbradbury with the header "Hi, japanese girl vs Playboy". This should make it immediately obvious it&#39;s not from Keith. If you receive something similar delete it immediately. It is infected with the W32 Klez H worm. 

Since this worm can spoof a sender&#39;s address it is not necessarily Keith who is infected--it could be anyone who has Keith in their address book. If you suspect that you might be infected go to this link 

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h@...

where you can learn more and also download a free utility to check and if necessary disinfect your machine.

Hope we are all clean.

I ran a check on the email and I got no viral alert; I even downloaded the Symantec fix. That indicated that my system was not infected for that particular virus. 
What was everyone else&#39;s experience?

Hi Keith,
Someone is posing as you and sending .pif viruses. Here is the header
if you want to chase them down and make them play Ferling...

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks, but I would not know how to chase them down.  Isn&#39;t this more
likely coming via someone&#39;s PC infected with my name in their address book?
