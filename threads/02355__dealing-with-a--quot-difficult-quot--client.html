            <pre class='message__body'>I hate to talk about the ugly side of this business.  Any business 
that deals people in good faith can have problems.  Up &#39;til now, I 
have had an easy time bending over backwards to please some 
occasional unreasonable expectations.  Often I&#39;m rewarded with return 
business or an Email months later saying that they like the piece 
they thought was "no good" after all.  Today, I feel bent over 
frontward and violated.

A client from France asked me to purchase a new Dukoff D9 for him and 
rework it to replace a long lost Dukoff he once had.  Total cost 
including my rework and s/h was $260.  He got it, claimed it was "no 
good" and demanded a refund.  Now, I know my work is far from "no 
good" and I was looking forward to getting this piece back for my own 
use.  So I sent him a full refund (customer service taken too far), 
asked him to return the piece and told him I would work on another 
one for him at my cost if he wished.  He asked what I would do 
differently and we agreed that he would probably not want the 
Dukoff "wart" removed from the chamber.  Most players love to see it 
go since Dukoffs can be too bright and thin.

Six weeks go by and I see nothing returned.  I start Emailing and get 
no replies.  After another two weeks, I get a reply.  The client 
claims to have been on vacation and the person he left the piece with 
did not return it for him.   He says he will mail it.  I&#39;m hopeful.  
About 2 weeks later, today, I finally get the piece.  At first I 
thought it was a different piece.  Then I see my "MOJO" and facing 
numbers scratched into the side.  The wedge baffle has been rough 
filed from a "D" to a "M" design.  The baffle by the tip has been 
relieved to the point where the bite plate has broken through the 
roof.  The table is convex.  I have not even begun to check out the 
facing curve.

I am just appalled that another sax brother would do this.  There are 
a lot of people in this world, so I guess it is just a matter of time 
before one&#39;s first really bad experiance comes along.  I just needed 
to vent about this one as part of my healing process.

Even before getting the piece, I had decided not to give full refunds 
without getting the piece back first.  I think I would have rather 
that he did not send the piece back instead of having a hacked one 
sent back.  It adds insult to injury.

I have asked for an explanation, but do not expect one.

            <pre class='message__body'>Mojo, you have to reface a lot of mouthpieces to make that money back.  
This is very frustrating, I am sure.

Perhaps we need to discuss a Terms of Business, what is fair to us, what 
is fair to the customer?  Anyone have suggestions?

            <pre class='message__body'>That&#39;s a rough deal.

I think the best thing to do moving forward is to clearly define the terms
of business in such a way that you are protected.  I am insisting on people
using a method of shipping that includes tracking for any returns.  If a
piece is returned damaged or not in the same shape as when you sent it out
then either a return shouldn&#39;t be issued or a prorated return should be
made.  I also think it&#39;s a good idea to charge some sort of restocking fee.

            <pre class='message__body'>This is the world of business...it&#39;s the 10% (if you&#39;re lucky) jerk 
factor. Unfortunately, it encourages &#39;business-persons&#39; to be hard-
nosed and thick-skinned. I have managed a variety of businesses (both 
personal and for startups and companies) and one must always budget 
for two things: "good will" and "dead accounts"...these should be 
obvious. The percentage varies according to the type of business, but 
you need to just make a call and add it to the cost of your services 
and products in a balance that you believe the market can bear. Those 
of us with day jobs who do some things on the side as much for good 
will as anything else...hmmm. Imagine how WW&BW accounts for all the 
mouthpiece &#39;trials&#39; that they support...most people just try 
mouthpieces with no intention of ever buying one. My guess is that 
they chalk this up to good will.

My "difficult" client is Aime Elbaz from Sarcelles, France.  It is OK 
with me if you want to deal with him... just take this warning to 
protect yourself as best you can.

I am part to blame for this outcome.  I allowed him to take advantage 
of my good will.  I still plan to offer good customer service in the 
future, but I will be more careful with making credits.

Thanks to all with your suggestions on this topic.

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s not unreasonable for you to require a mouthpiece be returned in 
original condition prior to a refund being issued.  If potential client 
balks at that, then you probably don&#39;t want to do business with them anyway.

Thanks Keith, for relating this experience and also posting the 
client&#39;s name. I was going to ask you to do this as a service to 
those of us who might stand to get burned by him as well.

I&#39;m trying to cultivate my client base here in Canada, and have 
pointed potential clients from the U.S. towards you and other 
American refacers. Dealing with cross-border shipping/duties/taxes 
between Canada and the U.S. is quite often a pain for both parties.

I might have been tempted to take a client from France though, so I&#39;m 
thankful for the heads up.
