            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve gone through a couple of glass gauges and decided to try making 
my own. I made an oversized measuring grid in Microsoft Paint, 
printed it with a laser printer and then used a copier to reduce it 
to the exact scale needed and print it on transparent film. I taped 
the film to top of a 2"x4" piece of glass.

Do you think that 2.5mm window or picture frame glass is flat enough 
for this?  I can post the .BMP file in the files area if anyone is 
interested (it is about 128KB).

            <pre class='message__body'>So, you are saying that a piece of window or picture glass is not 
going to be flat enough? If there isn&#39;t a cheap source of glass that 
is flat enough, to me, it isn&#39;t worth making a glass gauge. If there 
is glass that is flat enough, it is easy to make several in just a 
few minutes.

So far, the measurements I&#39;ve taken so far with my two homemade 
glasses do match the measurements I took with the Babbit glass, but I 
don&#39;t know if I&#39;m willing to trust them.

Also, I&#39;m pretty happy with the gauge that I&#39;ve printed out. It has 
markers for every 0.5mm and is much easier for me to read than to 
Babbit glass.

Hello Jon,
I &#39;m interested by your method, and be happy if you would post 
the.BMP on the file area.

explaining the print and copy settings for reduction. The file is 
called GlassGage3.zip and is in the Files/Methods folder.

I have several BMP files, this one is the most "busy" but it makes it 
easy to line up the mouthpiece and take quick readings. If anyone has 
suggestions on how to clean it up, let me know.

Of course, if the glass isn&#39;t flat, this DIY thing is more trouble 
than its worth.

Window glass is made by a cheap process (float glass) and is very 
flat...many people use this as grinding plates. 

I have, in the past, used microscope slides for this type of gage; 
they are cheap, flat and precut. I currently am using the Babbitt 
gauge, as it is good enough and easier to see than anything else. 
Transparency film is not particularly uniform or repeatable.

Your right about the errors reading through the glass, and the 
tranparency film won&#39;t stand up to the scraping of the feelers. I&#39;m 
just glad I now have some backups until I get a new Babbit glass to 
replace the one that was damaged.

Thanks for the info on window glass. That&#39;s nice to know. AAMOF, I&#39;ve 
been using a 8"x10" piece of picture glass that is a 6mm thick for 
lapping. I bought 4 of these picture frames at the local dollar store.

BTW, the dollar store often carries some good stuff for mouthpiece 
work. I also bought a pack of 8 sapphire nail files for $1. Great for 
grinding down epoxy baffles without fouling up files or messing with 
sand paper.

Thanks again,
Jon

Otherwise you have "parallax error".  That is, as you move your eye in

I was way off.  Now that I&#39;m back to my workbench I see that the 
Babbitt gauge has the scale and numbers lightly etched to the side 
that faces the mouthpiece.  The numbers are reversed so they read 
correctly through the glass.

hold the glass gauge on the mouthpiece with one hand and the feeler flat

 I record a left and right side measurement to track my progress.

glass rather than the Babbit glass gauge. I put a homemade gauge 
between the flat glass and a flat tabletop. Then I hold the

Also, you end up reading the gauge at the edge of the rails rather

I&#39;ve started printing out charts for my favorite facing curves on 
8.5"x11" sheets of paper in landscape mode. Then I tape a gauge on 
the right side of the paper. All I have to do to work on a piece is 
pull the chart from my binder, place a 8"x10" picture glass over it 
and start working.

Another thing that has helped is using two self-adhesive rubber feet 
as "bumbers" on the glass at each side of the mouthpiece to help keep 
it in place, at least from sliding side to side. It takes a couple of 
minutes to get the feet into position but it makes it much less 
tedious to line the mouthpiece up with the gauge.

For now, I&#39;m going to stick with this unless I find a problem with it.

            <pre class='message__body'>One thing you can do to make reading more precise is to place the gauge on a mirror and put the glass on top of that. It thus becomes easy to eliminate parallax by making sure that the feeler is aligned with its reflection when you read the gauge--that way you can make sure that you are not getting a false reading based on your reading at an angle through the glass. The same principle is used in many precision mechanical dial readouts, which have a mirrored strip just underneath the scale.

I don&#39;t know if it is really worth it in this case, but it should work.
