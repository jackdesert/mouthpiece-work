I&#39;ve been asked to remove and replace the bite plate of an old Link Tonemaster 
with original facing work. Just looking for simple suggestions on how to remove 
this exactly without causing too much damage.

Thanks all.

Remove the old bite plate by whatever means necessary. Get the top of  
a spray paint can. Cut and trim into a perfect fit. Install with gel  
type CA glue.

Thanks to Paul Coats who taught me this trick.....

Don&#39;t laugh at this until you try it! 
Remove the old bite plate by whatever means necessary. Get the top of a spray paint can. Cut and trim into a perfect fit. Install with gel type CA glue.

I&#39;ve been asked to remove and replace the bite plate of an old Link Tonemaster with original facing work. Just looking for simple suggestions on how to remove this exactly without causing too much damage.

Thanks all.

            <pre class='message__body'>To minimize damage during removal, I suggest soaking it in some kind of glue thinner or rubbing alcohol for a day.  That should get to the glue and loosen it.
If it does not fall right out, place it in the freezer for a few hours.
The plastic/rubber of the plate will shrink more than the metal and it should be easier to remove.

I tried this last night with a current production Link I had lying around.  I removed the black bite plate fairly easily with a sharp small wood chisel (thanks Keith).  The plastic cap material is just a fuzz shallow but worked great.  Thanks again.
