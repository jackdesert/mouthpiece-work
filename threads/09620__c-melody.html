            <pre class='message__body'>I second Steve&#39;s comment, most tenor pieces do not work well with c-mels. Check out Aquilasax mouthpieces at https://aquilasax.3dcartstores.com/C-melody-Tenor-sax-mouthpieces_c_16-1.html, they make a good variety. I&#39;ve used the MetalPro and the MetalPro WideBody. The WideBody has a great beefy sound and both pieces have good intonation with both my York and Aquilasax c-mels.

            <pre class='message__body'>Runyon makes an actual, modern C melody mouthpiece. Contact Mr. Paul Coats (he is a frequent contributer on the forum) and ask for the C Melody Custom Spoiler mouthpiece in your choice of color and facing. It changed my sax into a MUCH more in tune, user friendly axe! I now can use it for mellow pop & classical or edgy rock depending on if I use the spoiler (a removeable wedge with the wavy metal tongue). 

If you want to play the instrument well, I feel working on an alto sax or tenor sax mouthpiece is just wasting your time compared to these mouthpieces. AND unlike a vintage C melody mouthpiece, (and I think the new Aquilla mouthpieces), they are made to fit a regular tenor sax reed.

FYI- This is not a paid endorsement. I am just pleased with the product and personal service!

Can anybody tell me if there&#39;s a practical difference between the C-melodies with a long straight neck (looks like a big alto) and the ones with a short curved neck (resembles a small tenor)?

Just curious.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Thanks for all the great info and input, everyone. My "Franken-piece" project
of trying to modify an alto or tenor piece for the C-melody is just a learning
exercise (with mediocre results so far). I've tried a couple of C-melodies in
pawn shops over the years, but that's the extent of my experience with them.  
  
I'm sure the horn's owner will wind up with a modern mpc designed for
C-melody. The horn is an old Conn (rolled tone holes, neck shaped like an alto
neck, microtuner on the neck), BTW.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Tom,

I have a new Aquilasax c-mel that I got with both straight and curved necks. The ergonomics are much better for with the straight neck as it lowers the position of the horn relative to my body. This makes my hand positions more natural and less tiring. I&#39;m 6&#39;2" tall, a short person might find the curved neck better for them. There are no noticeable acoustic consequences to changing the necks.

Of course, it&#39;s not a totally "off-the-shelf" mouthpiece. It has been adjusted by (IMHO) an expert in the the field of mouthpiece work.

The French-American Reed Co. still makes C-melody reeds, too I believe.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Been there, tried it, and I am MUCH more satisfied with the Runyon Custom
Spoiler mouthpiece, with or without the spoiler baffle. It just plays
throughout the horn better in tune and with a more modern tone. No more stuffy
parlor freak from the 30's; it is a real sax now! Before I tried any Runyon
Mouthpieces, I had both an old Conn and a Buescher mouthpiece refaced to
Selmer C* tenor sax specs, which helped a lot. A baffle helped some more, but
the Runyon kicks their tails way into the "historical preservation box of
extra mouthpieces", never to see the light of day again. It really is that
much of a difference. Also, I can use my favorite Tenor Sax or Bass Clarinet
reed on the Runyon mouthpiece. (Bass clarinet reeds have a shorter tail, but
are about the same cut, so it can work better on a tuneable neck. Compare them
before you blast me, please.) Two things else to consider, 1. cost wise, how
many hours are you looking at to reface the Conn mouthpiece, reduce the
chamber volume, and make a baffle vs. the cost of a replaceable, better
playing mouthpiece? 2. For the group I play it in, they knew something was
different the first time I player the Runyon and liked it a lot. Also, FYI:
Guru Steve says to "put the biggest resonators you can in on your next re-
pad". I fully agree on C melody saxophones. It is a bit of a pain to get the
flat stainless ones center punched and under the Buescher snaps. But it looks
nice, and also really helps to liven up the sax. If it is too lively, use a
soft ligature and remove the spoiler to mello it out. It still projects
nicely. E v e r e t t F i d l e r \\--- In MouthpieceWork@yahoogroups.com,

It may not be them though, but some other chinese company. I have a few pack
of c melody reeds that are to big for alto and to small for tenor, but fit my
buescher c-melody mouthpiece just right. >> >> > >> >> > >> >> Isaac > > >
