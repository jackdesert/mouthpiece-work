Working through the posts from zero. Great site . Thanks Keith.
I have used Berg Larsen on Clarrie since 1957.
 I ordered a 60/2 SMS directly from Berg and he re-layed it from a
stock .050". Beautifully hand finished on very hard shiny black
ebonite. Still perfect after 46 years use. A fairly bulky design with
a broad beak. I recently sold it on Ebay UK, so can&#39;t check the facing
measurements. 
    I have measured my even earlier Larsen 60/0 M. This is the so
called American Lay, which I understand was to match American cut
reeds of that period.     E.G. Rico standard flat cut thick tip.
It has a quick break from the table followed by a fairly flat curve,
increasing slightly at the tip. It measures 58 at the tip, nominally
60 as the markings went up in increments of 0.005" ....It&#39;s a great
blower for Jazz styles even using &#39;French cut&#39; (SMS) reeds.
