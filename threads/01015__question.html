            <pre class='message__body'>Hello!
That´s a great newsgroup, I got already dozens of helpful insights! Thanks also to Paul Coats for the help with the mouthpiece (how much to put it in or out..), will report my results with the pitch exercise soon..
I looked at Ralph Morgans Inventory of Mouthpiece Maker´s Hand Tools and didn´t understand some of the terms:
The tearms are:
Reamers: must they have a certain diameter? Are they used for shaping bore? I think it´s normally for drilling holes..

Scribers/Scrapers: these are just normal ones?

Course file: I got some swiss files and a flat file, what does the term "course file" mean?

Contour templates: Would be nice to know about that, no idea..

Contour gauges: ?

Holder for small pieces of cutting paper: Does this mean a hand holder?

Inside telescopic gauge: ?

Expandable Ligature: ?

Taper gauge in thousands of an inch and long tapered wand gauge in hundreds of mm: I don´t even know what the difference of a normal glass gauge and a taper gauge is, would be nice to help..

Also would be happy to know where some of this articles could be found for ordering...

Many thanks, will appreciate any help..Chriss

 The Eric Brand Repair Manual has good informtion on mouthpiece refacing
that will help you.

Drill bits are for drilling holes.  Reamers are for obtaining more 
precise holes.  Ralph probably uses these for MP bores.  Some bores 
are tapered and there are tapered Reamers.  I get by using rotary 
tools and sandpaper.

I would think so.  I find a pocket knife usefull on HR, plastic and 
soft metals.  A pin vise and a blue needle spring make a decent 
scriber.

Coarse means the ridges of the file are farther apart.  A wood file 
is coarser than a metal file.  Mouthpiece work likes something in 
between coarse and fine.

I use reeds for tip curves.  Ralph may also have templates for his 
mouthpiece exteriors and interiors.

> Contour gauges: ?
> 

There is a crude gage used in woodworking to copy profiles of 
decorative wood trim.  Like Paul says, it has a series of sliding 
pins that can be pressed against a contour to conform to its shape.  
I have one of these but I do not find it usefull.

I guess a sandpaper holder.  I use my hands.

These are machinists&#39; tools.  This could be useful to measure the 
inside of chambers.  I only have calipers and they can not reach in 
very far.

> Expandable Ligature: ?

I guess so you can test all different sizes on mouthpiece without 
buying a bunch of ligatures.  I use a Ligaphone and a bunch of others.

> Taper gauge in thousands of an inch and long tapered wand gauge in 
hundreds of mm: I don´t even know what the difference of a normal

Like Paul said.  I do not use one of these.

There is a list of US sources in the Files Tools area of the MP Works 
site.
