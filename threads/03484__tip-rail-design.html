            <pre class='message__body'>How can I make a very very good tip rail on rubber MPC&#39;s? I developed 
some rudimental technique (fine waterproof sand paper on a narrow wood 
stick) but some time (big rollover baffles) it doesn&#39;t work well and I 
need to restart again opening the piece more and more...
Can someone help me please? What tools I need to make a very good job?
Thanks a lot for the answers,

Dan

            <pre class='message__body'>You need some very small files.  I find the round tapered ones work 
well on defining the tip rail.  Read message 3014.  Paul Coats answered 
this very well for me a while back.  It should help.
