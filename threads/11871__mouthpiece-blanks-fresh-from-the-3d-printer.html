            <pre class='message__body'>yes, we can make them any color…….these are made in Delrin……the facings are quite accurate right out of the printer, but will require a little hand work……we&#39;re definitely on to something here! I&#39;ll be glad to answer questions but will not get into proprietary information, as we have plans to market this product…..this is the first "real" batch, and we&#39;re learning as we go

            <pre class='message__body'>The color is interesting.  I have only seen Delrin in black and white.

            <pre class='message__body'>So can you comment more on the accuracy? 

 My guess is when you say there is some hand finishing required, you mean the curve might need a few swipes and the rails & baffle could use some detail work. Am I in the ballpark?
 

 Does this mean I could send you my favorite mouthpieces and you could 3D scan & print 5 to 10 of each for me to experiment with? Are there any reasons you (or someone else) wouldn't be able to provide this service?
 

 What is the material cost per mouthpiece?
 

 Very interesting... I had been reading about 3D printing in the past only as a spectator simply because I still have so many basics to learn.
 

 But if this would allow me to be able to focus on the finishing with a handful of mouthpieces in the ballpark of what I already know and like to play would be extremely helpful for me.

YES, SOME HAND FINISHING IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED……..WE THINK WE CAN OVERCOME THAT

YES……WE HAVE VERY SUCCESSFULLY PRINTED ABOUT A HALF DOZEN DIFFERENT MOUTHPIECES FROM MY PERSONAL COLLECTION

WE&#39;RE NOT IN THAT BUSINESS…..WE ONLY MAKE OUR OWN DESIGNS……

THAT IS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

THIS IS THE THIRD GENERATION MACHINE FOR US…..WE&#39;VE LEARNED A LOT, AND THE TECHNOLOGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH, MUCH BETTER

            <pre class='message__body'>I am delighted to answer any non business questions…..we&#39;re making very good progress with this project……we learn a little more with every batch we run…….next week we&#39;re going to run some carbon fiber ones……we&#39;ve had good luck this week increasing the density of the material as it is laid down in the printing process
