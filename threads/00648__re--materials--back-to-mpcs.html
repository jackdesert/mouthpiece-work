            <pre class='message__body'>There is a very real way that materials apply to mpcs, and it has to do with mechanical wear. Metal mpcs are much harder and resist facing changes induced by that reed slapping again the thin side and tip rails. If you have a metal mpc that you like and you handle it carefully you can expect it to play the same for a lifetime. The same cannot be said of ebonite and plastic pieces. At some point they&#39;ll need refacing and that will inevitable change the way they play somewhat.

And since metal is so much harder, the mpc itself can be made much thinner. Perhaps I have a big mouth ;~) but I find metal pieces much more difficult to seal well. I prefer the feel of my MC Gregory to my Berg Larsen, and my Beechler metal  alto piece--although it looks like a rocket ship--drives me to distraction. 

Some studies on mpcs have shown that they vibrate in all kinds of unexpected ways--sometimes at double the rate of the reed (!) So I guess if materials did make a difference, mpcs would be one of the places to start looking...

But I repeat that Phil Barone has stated several times in reference to the mpcs he makes that as long as the internal dimensions are the same there is no difference in the way they play or sound.

But if people want to buy his mpcs in solid silver he is willing to sell them to them.

I hope I&#39;m not misquoting you Phil.

Best to all,

            <pre class='message__body'>I, too, was first attracted to metal tenor mouthpieces, and later bari
sax, for the same reason.  The big fat "standard size" mouthpieces quite
literally make me gag.  I just cannot play them.
