            <pre class='message__body'>Here&#39;s the best I can figure out, looking at the 1939 Brand/Selmer 
manual and what info I have been able to come up with for the Morgan

1 large special glass surface plate
1 glass direct reading gauge
1 special tip opening gauge (taper gauge)
1 set of feeler gauges:  .0015, .010, .024, .034, .050

gauges:  .0015, .010, .014, .024, .031,. .048, .063, .077, .094
silicon carbide abrasive paper, 400 and 600 grit

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice Comparison. A small point about the Winslow Kit. The listing for
the kit in the WW&BW catalog does say "one half round file for the
baffle" but one of the photos of the kit shows two files???

            <pre class='message__body'>Until I&#39;m able to obtain a Winslow kit (currently back-ordered at 
WW&BW, as often happens with a lot of their merchandise) there&#39;s no 
way I can begin to guess at the discrepancy between the narrative 
description and the photo, regarding how many files are in the kit.

Luckily enough, my local library has a copy of the 1939 Brand/Selmer 
book so I was able to find out what was in that early kit, to get an 
idea of whether or not there&#39;s been much change between then and now.

Being somewhat concerned about how easy it may be for me to damage 
some feeler gauges, I&#39;ve been looking at www.toolsource.com and 
www.snapon.com along with Yahoo! Shopping and have discovered there 
are more general feeler gauges available than I could begin to 
imagine.  It looks like all of the sizes mentioned here are 
relatively easy to obtain, for $3.95 and up, depending on whether or 
not a person wants to get fancy and use stainless steel.

The one critical and significant difference, from what I seem to be 
reading into looking at necessary MPC tools, is the innovation of 
Winslow&#39;s dial indicator gauge.  The bar holder is not something 
easily obtained and probably would have to be custom made, probably a 
costly consideration when this tool is already available in Winslow&#39;s 
kit.

The other tool difference seems to be what is referred to in a 
variety of terms in other kits and discussions:  special tip opening 
gauge, wand gauge, taper gauge, or curved tip gauge.  These gauges 
are difficult to obtain, reference some of Paul Coats&#39; discussions.  
The only commercial source for these gauges, I have been able to 
discover so far, appears to be Babbitt and, although I&#39;ve yet to call 
them, there are supposedly a couple of significant differences 
available in these tools; one being a 260 vs. 280 (length or size, I 
assume) and the other being inexpensive models for folks who don&#39;t 
feel the need for the precision of good professional gauges.

The glass guages used in MPC kits and refacing have been discussed 
previously by Keith, as coming in a variety of options:  narrow vs. 
wide, setback zero or flush, metric or inch units of measurement.  
For those with preferences for a glass gauge different than what&#39;s in 
the kits, it seems reasonable enough to obtain them for around $15 
each, directly from Babbitt.

Considering Brand&#39;s detailed description of mouthpiece work is still 
available in the 8th edition of his old manual, and can be purchased 
from Ferree&#39;s, it seems to me, given my tool preferences and the 
reinforcement of Paul Coats&#39; discussions of his and Santy Runyon&#39;s 
preferences among kits, the Winslow kit appears to be the best kit 
for my money, unless I want to buy all the components separately and 
have a base or holder made for a dial gauge - an undertaking that 
probably would be more hassle than it&#39;s worth, for me.

At the extreme, I still may also consider the Morgan kit, as well, 
since I live only 15-20 miles from him and would like to spend some 
time with Mr. Morgan once I get a better idea of what&#39;s involved in 
working with MPCs, from my own hands-on experiences.  At the moment, 
this is just a passing fantasy and not anything I feel altogether 
certain about since I&#39;m not one to like to intrude upon folks 
professional lives and activities unless we come to a reasonable 
agreement beforehand about what we&#39;re doing, such as exchanging 
information, data, experiences, and opinions as is so easily done 
online these days.

I would highly recommend that anyone who lives close to a mouthpiece maker
or refacer try to contact them for a visit.  I visited Bob Ackerman years
ago and he did some work for me which got me interested in the craft.  I
have tried to get with Theo but he has been too busy.

There is an awful lot that can be gleaned from watching someone actually do
the work.  Plus, you could set up a relationship for follow up questions. 
We could all benefit from what you learn.  Not all will be willing to do
this, but we&#39;ve all been rejected before havn&#39;t we?.

Here is a list of names I have found of people who do refacing work.  Maybe
someone is near you.

            <pre class='message__body'>The supplied file is the one piece of this kit I do not like.  I use a
smaller file given to me by Lilly at Runyon, the kind they use at the
factory.  It is approximately �� wide, flat on one side, and slightly
rounded on the other.  There are similar files in the MicroMark catalog.

The Winslow kit (Madison Enterprises) file is just too large for my
needs.  I have also added a File Card from Ferree�s, which is used to
clean files.  It is a plastic piece with short metal bristles.

YES, you want stainless steel.  Non-stainless feelers can easily get a
coating of rust, and that ruins them.

What part of LA, or is that LouisianA? Does anyone know of anyone

Do we know where Emil & Scot are in WI? I will be there in a few
weeks and would love to stop in, if I&#39;m able.

Thank you,

David
