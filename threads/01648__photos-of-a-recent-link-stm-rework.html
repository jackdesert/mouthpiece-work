Since I am new to the grouop, relative to this message, and the
location where these photos were posted, are they available anywhere
else?  I looked in the Photos section of this site and looked at teh
Link transformation photos, but since there aren&#39;t 27, I didn&#39;t think
it was the same job.

If the photos are in the Photos section, please point me in there
direction.  Otherwise, is it possible for you to post them in the
Photos section?

Thank you,

David
