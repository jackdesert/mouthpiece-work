            <pre class='message__body'>Again, not knowing anything of mouthpieces myself. It is great to see someone take the time to explain ANYTHING about them. However, the mention of rails, tips, angles, tables, curves, facing and etc, etc & etc might be of even more help it that feature were pointed out clearly and its benefit stated as opposed to say a wider, more narrow, steeper, this or that.
With that said from my experience  someone with the smarts to be at a level to already be in the position to want to but an additional mouthpiece may not need all that info.
Me, as in a "NEWBIE" would probably go for the 9.99$ mouthpiece and just be happy. Then later when the knowledge and experience is there the knowledge passed on from say your site, would be of help in selection of a better mouthpiece.

For my 2 cents. Hey ! Thanks for even taking the time to produce such a project.

 As I search through the various ads, trying to come up with what I hope is a "DECENT" and for now, inexpensive ( if there is such a thing ) there is a HUGE lack of info on the various mouthpiece products offered.

Steve, you are doing the professional, semi-pro, hobbyist and amateur saxophone players a substantial favor with putting this kind of information in your eBay and web site listings.  This is far and above anything else I&#39;ve seen anywhere.  Even with the crummy video quality, seeing the piece move really gives a good idea of what the inside looks like.  

Even Theo Wanne&#39;s site, which I like very much, isn&#39;t this informative, because even with well produced still images, you don&#39;t get the true perspective that a simple video shows of the mouthpiece.

Keep doing it your way, all you need to do is put the flip-cam on a tripod and you will be gold.  This is fabulous!

Regarding your returns policy, I think that as long as a buyer has 24 - 48 hours to evaluate a piece, that is sufficient. Of course, the return should be at the buyer&#39;s expense and the piece in like-new condition.

            <pre class='message__body'>The real advantage of purchasing a mouthpiece from a music store with a good selection is that you can try and compare several at one time, come in as often as you like (within reason) and it costs nothing to "audition" a mouthpiece in this fashion.

To try a $175 mouthpiece sold on Ebay would cost the customer from $52 to $67 in costs and fees depending upon the return shipping method used.  Even then the customer is given a return credit instead of a cash refund.

I&#39;m not sure how many serious players would be willing to buy a mouthpiece under these conditions no matter how nice the video looks or how well the mouthpiece features are described. Good customer relations are an important element in retail sales and should be a part of the equation in my experience.  Having the customers assume all of the risk if they don&#39;t like the product seems to me to be working against rather than for the seller&#39;s self interest.

Just trying to be helpful in giving the consumer&#39;s point of view.

            <pre class='message__body'>Maybe a good place to start would be to look at the eBay seller&#39;s
feedback...we sold slightly less than a thousand mouthpieces last year on
our various sites, so apparently many people don&#39;t have a problem with our
low price/high quality model..I fail to see how good customer relations is
not part of our equation, since everybody appears to be quite happy. I
strongly  object to this characterization, just as I objected to being
called "rude" and "sarcastic".  I suspect a different motive other than
trying to present the "consumer&#39;s point of view", since obviously people are
quite satisfied with our system. I think your continued posting on this
topic alleges a problem which simply does not exist.  We recently increased
our mouthpiece production up to the highest level possible with current
facilities, and we still find that demand pretty much equals available
supply. We are apparently doing something right. Our pricing reflects our
costs, which is why we sell for less on our www.nationofmusic.com site than
we do on eBay. 

 

We&#39;re quite happy for customers to try mouthpieces at our offices. I&#39;m just
not in the "on approval" business, and fully disclose this. If they don&#39;t
accept this policy, they should go somewhere else. It&#39;s OK with us. We don&#39;t
mind in the least. We are not interested in being "all things to all
people". Last time I checked, the USA was a democracy, and we are free to
pretty much conduct our business the way that we see fit.

 

You&#39;ve made MULTIPLE posts on this same subject. I&#39;ve answered every one,
and I believe that I have been very clear about why our policy is what it is
and about the fact that it is not going to change. What is the point in
bringing this same thing up over and over? I believe you made your point
LONG ago.
