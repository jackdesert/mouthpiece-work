            <pre class='message__body'>> What tuning program are you using? Thanks.

Audio Phonics Instrument Tuner from www.simtel.net. Just type &#39;audio 
phonics&#39; into the search box at the top of their main page. It is 
the only freeware tuning program I could find.

Works fine for me except that I had trouble with the &#39;Instrument 
Key&#39; setting. I just leave it set to &#39;C&#39; all the time.

            <pre class='message__body'>With tuners (like the Korg) selling for &lt; $15, I have 2 and plan to get a
3rd one soon.  I keep one in each "practice room" in my house so the kids
and I do not have to keep searching for one.
