Paul,
  This seems like a very interesting concept. You wouldn&#39;t mind giving up 
the rest of the secret -aka. how you decide how far to drift those last few 
measurements - would you???

Thanks,

            <pre class='message__body'>For soprano and alto I usually lengthen the .0015" and .010" feelers by 
2 mm.  (+4 on the E Brand gauges).  For tenor and bari, length by 3mm (+6).
