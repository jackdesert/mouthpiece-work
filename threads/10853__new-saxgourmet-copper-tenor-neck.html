>>>> Here are some more detailed pictures of our new model tenor neck,  
>>>> which will be available this summer. A companion alto neck will  
>>>> be introduced in the fall. This neck is an evolution of our  
>>>> previous models, and has several new features. There are no plans  
>>>> for a soprano or baritone version at this time.
>>>>
>>>> The alloy used on this model is phosphor-copper, which we find to  
>>>> have a bit broader spectrum and quicker response than the  all  
>>>> copper alloy we had previously used.
>>>>
>>>> You will notice that the large weight bearing the Saxgourmet logo  
>>>> suspended under the neck tube is attached at two points only.  
>>>> These points correspond to the nodes of G2 and D2, and by  
>>>> focusing mass on these points, the response for these troublesome  
>>>> notes is significantly improved.
>>>>
>>>> The neck also has our exclusive Nodal Weights, as used on  
>>>> previous designs. These weights enhance mid range response.
>>>>
>>>> The interior of the tenon is threaded to produce a boundary layer  
>>>> which improves the response of the lowest notes and eliminates  
>>>> "motorboating" and eases the sub-tone.
>>>>
>>>> The taper is all new, and improves intonation and the evenness   
>>>> of timbre between octaves.
>>>>
>>>> The curve of the neck is new and gives a more comfortable playing  
>>>> position and promotes a more open and relaxed throat.
>>>>
>>>> Our Neck Enhancer is an integral part of this design, and  
>>>> decreases blowing resistance and facilitates the altissimo.
>>>>
>>>> The amount of hand cut engraving has been significantly  
>>>> increased, and is of a higher quality with much more fine detail.
>>>>
>>>> Each neck comes in our hard shell Saxgourmet neck case.
>>>>
>>>> This model will be initially available in specific versions for  
>>>> Selmer, Yamaha, Keilwerth, Yanigasawa, Conn (single socket only),  
>>>> Buescher, King (single socket only), Buffet, Mauriat, Cannonball,  
>>>> Saxgourmet (without high G or altissimo key), LA Sax, and some  
>>>> other brands.
>>>>
>>>> The retail price is $600. FOB New Orleans. It will be listed on  
>>>> our site, www.nationofmusic.com as soon as they are in stock.  
>>>> which should be in approximately 45 days.
