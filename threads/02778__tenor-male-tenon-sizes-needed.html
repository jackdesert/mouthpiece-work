  I&#39;ve finished up the prototype Saxgourmet tenor neck and would like to ask those of you with time on your hands to send me the OD (in mm, please) of as many tenor male tenons as you can so I can get an idea of what sizes I&#39;ll need. The model and 1st three digits of the serial number would be MUCH appreciated!
