those of you with time on your hands to send me the OD (in mm, please) of as
many tenor male tenons as you can so I can get an idea of what sizes I&#39;ll
need. The model and 1st three digits of the serial number would be MUCH
appreciated!
 
I&#39;m trying to get a feel for what&#39;s actually out there, not original specs.
