I have just purchased second hand a Lawton Brass ( or gold plated - 
Iam not sure )
Alto mouthpiece that is in need of a good clean - especially
inside.
Can I please be given some advice as to how to soak away the grime 
that has accumulated on the inside. I might find it difficult to 
aquire chemical dips in the UK! 
So, can someone recommend a household commodity that will clean 
without damaging the metal.
Best Regards. Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>Common white vinegar will remove white calcified saliva stains. 

A mouthpiece may be sterilized by dipping it for 30 to 60 seconds in a 
solution of 90% water and 10% laundry bleach.  Do NOT get this on your 
skin, eyes, or clothes.  Then rinse in room temperature water.  This 
will kill everything, including Hepatitus and HIV (AIDS virus).

If it is green brass grunge, try an old toothbrush and common brass 
polish, and just scrub away.

For the outside, go over it with a very fine metal polish, such as 
Flitz.  Flitz, which I think is a German product, is an excellent 
polish.  I have used it to remove light rust from some firearms, little 
specks, which it did without harming the blued finish.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Paul,
Yes it is mainly white calcified saliva staining on the inside right up to 
the throat.
How would the white vinegar be applied? and for how long?
Is it simply a question of immersing the mp in the vinegar until the deposits 
can be removed with a tooth brush? and then giving it a good rinse!

Coult this also be used on mouthpieces of rubber and plastic?

Many thanks,
Peter

Dilute the white vinegar with water, and only leave the mpc in the solution 
for a couple of minutes.  Use cool or cold water, as warm or hot water will 
discolor the mpc immediately.  Soak the mpc for just a minute or two - only 
long enough to softer the calcification.  Then take it out and use your

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks Paul for all your help.
I now have the mp nice and clean with all of the deposits removed - great 
stuff!
I now find that on the baffle the brass has very small pit holes - The guy 
who had this before me must have had some acid breath!  and certainly didn&#39;t 
clean it.
At first glance I thought it was gunge adhering to the surface - but I was 
wrong - with the help of a magnifying glass I can put the tip of my penknife in 
the tiny pit holes.
Will this small amount of pitting affect the mp in any way?
Is there anything I can do?
I dont really want to remove brass because this would alter the baffle 
somewhat.
What would you do?????
Regards, Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Braun electric toothbrush that uses a small round brush head.
Instead of throwing away my worn toothbrush heads, I use them for cleaning
my mouthpieces as well as hard to reach areas on saxophones. It works very
well, indeed.

Subject: Mouthpiece Cleaning

I read on a Sax site someone recommending the use of a mouthpiece brush. 
Though I do use one of these ,I realise that repeated use is just shoving the 
bugs and germs in and out of the instrument. Has anyone got a suggestion 
regarding cleaning fluid made for this purpose.






don&#39;t know about the brush, but I clean my mouthpieces using dissolving 
tablets that people use to clean dental prosthetics(sp?)/fake teeth. It&#39;s even 
anti-bacterial. Just let it sit in the fluid (dissolved tablet in a bit of 
water) in a glass for 20 mins or so.... tastes ok too :)

mouthpiece.

Don&#39;t even use "warm" water.  Use only cool tap water.  Hard rubber is 
easily warped.

Also, you can disinfect a mouthpiece, or other things, INCLUDING killing 
AIDS and Hepatitus virus, with a solution of 90% water and 10% chlorine 
bleach (Clorox, Purex, etc).This is used for cleanup and disinfection at accident scenes.
Paul



But that can&#39;t be good for the mouthpiece, can it..??
