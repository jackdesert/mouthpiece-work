            <pre class='message__body'>I'm still using 2003 MS Excel for my facing curve analysis and curve generation.  One of the key features that makes elliptical curve fitting easier is the built-in solver add-on in Excel.  I can code my own in a spreadsheet if it has iterative recalculating features, but the built-in solver is handy and cleaner.
 
 Do I need to stick with Office 365 to get the solver feature or are there other options now?  Seems like most of the other choices just have basic spreadsheet features and no advanced stuff.

            <pre class='message__body'>can't find a free option.  You could always rewrite your spreadsheet to not require the solver if you want to get away from Excel. </pre>

 Open office is free, and the software is very feature laden. You may be able to cut and paste your excel in to calc, and the solver may work.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had tried Open Office some years back when for some reason, MS Office stopped working on my computer and could not be repaired despite reinstallation with the disks.  

I found Open Office did not work well for any but the most simple documents.  Excell or Word documents with photos, or any special formatting were messed up beyond repair.  

Since Word and Excell are absolute necessities for what I do, I bought a new computer.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have not tried Apache OpenOffice yet.  On the to-do list.  But I did some news searches and learned that there are 2-3 OpenOffice suites out there.  They splintered a few years back for various reasons and now each have their own development path.  A different one is favored by Linex users.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well I downloaded Apache OpenOffice and tried using my speadsheets in it.  The facing curve graph was compressed vertically ~10X and was unreadable.  All the parts of the built in solver look like they are there.  But it does not solve my facing curve fit.
