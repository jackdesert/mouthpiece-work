            <pre class='message__body'>I'm still using 2003 MS Excel for my facing curve analysis and curve generation.  One of the key features that makes elliptical curve fitting easier is the built-in solver add-on in Excel.  I can code my own in a spreadsheet if it has iterative recalculating features, but the built-in solver is handy and cleaner.
 
 Do I need to stick with Office 365 to get the solver feature or are there other options now?  Seems like most of the other choices just have basic spreadsheet features and no advanced stuff.
