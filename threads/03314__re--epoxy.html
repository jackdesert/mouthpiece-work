            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve observed problems with JB Weld staying put in metal Links.  JVW like
to coat the inside of them to make the chamber smaller.  Eventually, it
pulls away from the sides.  I&#39;ve work on to of these to clean them up.

I also have used a brass powder epoxy for baffles in Links.  Looks great
when new but tarnishes like raw brass.  I think its the stuff that Theo
uses but I got mine from McMaster-Carr.  Anyhow, I have had a baffle fall
out of a metal Link.   It was from a client in Finland.  I quizzed him on
the number temperature cycles it was exposed to and we came up with about
100 with several of them being from bitter winter cold to playing and
summer in-the-trunk hot to playing.

It seems like the plumber putty epoxy has some give to it when cured.  I
have not seen any pull away yet.

I&#39;ve pretty much settled on using JB Weld just for tip replacements 
and tooth marks on rubber pieces. I particularly like it for tips, 
but you have to let it cure several days first. I&#39;d be wary of 
putting any epoxy material into a metal piece without drilling some 
small anchor holes.

            <pre class='message__body'>I didnt think of holes or I might have...on the other hand, I didnt 
want to do anything I couldnt at least file out.  I cleaned it and 
scratched the surface with a file first.  I didnt coat the sidewalls as 
I wanted the scooped effect to remain.  I just raised the floor and 
made it the shape I wanted.  Plumbers putty does seem to have some 
flexibility after it dries.  They say it dries like steel but it really 
more like hard a hard plastic.  as I said earlier, it feels like your 
working hard rubber when shaping it.  I guess time will tell.  Its not 
a piece Im selling so if I have to do it over its just my time and 
effort.  Heck, maybe my redo job will be better than the first if that 
comes around!  If I have to do it again I will pit the surface deeper.

            <pre class='message__body'>Stephen Howard used to use JB Weld for mpc repair. He contacted them after we had this same discussion about xeroestrogens in epoxies and was told that it is not recommended in applications where there is oral contact.
