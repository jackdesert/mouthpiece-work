Asunto: Re: [MouthpieceWork] Woodwind Interior Measurement Methods



A very interesting discussion, may I pursue it a bit farther? I have searched patent art, earlier for a living, now for musical insts, and recalled that the USPTO classification system has a "Measuring and Testing" Class 33/subclasses for such inventions.  Taking a quick look/search of our subject via "clarinet AND measuring AND mouthpiece AND interior" , I found two pats to Lorenzini US 4,219,937 and 4,485,559 [both expired] related to his work?? on bore and mp measurement, which may interest several of us.  I may "dig a bit deeper" and welcome others to do it also [will help].  "Nuff for now, Don

PC-7 is a good black epoxy putty. Don&#39;t use too much of the gray 
hardening putty and it will dry black
