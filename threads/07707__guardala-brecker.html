When answering, please put the feeler guage size beside the measurement because some of us don&#39;t use the same guages. Fo instance I usually go in increments of 5 thou.

Also it is helpful to specify the glass gauge increments, E. Brand (each increment is 1/2 mm) or mm&#39;s.  A facing length on the E. Brand scale might be 43, which is 21.5 mm&#39;s.

Same with tip openings.  The E. Brand tip wands were in hundredths of mm&#39;s, so that a tip reading of 135 is 1.35 mm or (1.35 mm / 25.3 mm/in = ) .053" (or "53 thousandths")

Sorry to get picky, Paul, you know I think the most of you, but 25.4 mm to the inch.

Cheers,
Geoff.

You are absolutely correct... it was a typo.  Honest!
