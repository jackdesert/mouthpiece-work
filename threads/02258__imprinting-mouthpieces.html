            <pre class='message__body'>Does anyone have any suggestions for imprinting on a mouthpiece.  I 
would like to minimally place the tip opening and I would prefer to 
not use the engraving attachment for the dremel.  The dremel does not 
give the sort of professional appearance that I would prefer.

I&#39;ve thought about embossers or heat methods but haven&#39;t made it to a 
decent sized hobby shop to see if they have anything that might be of 
us or that could be easily modified to fit my needs.

Thanks,


Ed

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Ed,
In each case no matter what option you use the problem is the same -
most imprinting methods are made for flat surfaces. I have tried to
find a simple, fairly inexpensive way to mark my mouthpiece line
coming out next week and I have decided on engraving. It requires a
little more adjusting during the process, but is definitely more solid
than the heat stamping I was trying. 
I use a big New Hermes setup. Other big manufacturers use custom made
heat foil stamping setups.
If you just need a quick one time only job, you can buy metal
letter/number stamps fairly cheaply (harbor freight) heat the end and
place it on the MP. viola!

            <pre class='message__body'>Ed:  My wife found a nice inexpensive number/letter stamp die kit for 
$18 at www.harrietcarter.com &lt;http://www.harrietcarter.com/>.  The 
numbers and letters are between 1/8" and 3/16" tall.  Probably a mm

These can be heated in your Bunsen burner flame, and a number branded 
into a plastic or metal mouthpiece.

 

For metal, you would need a good steady bench vise, with a steel rod 
approximately the same diameter as the bore of the mouthpiece.  Then 
slip the mouthpiece on the rod, and with a hammer, strike the die, 
imprint the mouthpiece.  If not done in this manner, the thin brass 
mouthpiece will dent in if you hit it hard enough to mark the 
mouthpiece.  So, I warned you.

Another idea I had was to salvage type from an old manual typewriter and
place them on a metal backing plate which would be heated.  I think I&#39;ll
give the link you sent a try.

theres a music store down the street from ours that is manufacturing clarinet bells 
and barrels (Backun music) and I think they are paying another company to laser 
engrave these pieces, maybe this could work. check out their site backunmusical.com
