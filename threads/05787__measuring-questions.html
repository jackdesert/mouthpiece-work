            <pre class='message__body'>I have a couple of questions concerning measuring:

1. How do you keep the mouthpiece from slipping on the glass gauge as 
you attempt to measure it? I seem to get about 2 seconds in one spot, 
and then the mouthpiece moves. (It takes me a while to get a decent 
measurement!) Am I holding it too tight, or not tight enough?

2. If using a set back gauge, how do you consistently line up the tip 
with the zero mark?

I cannot answer your second question as I use an end gauge ...Eddie.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

When a mouthpiece is hard to hold in place on a glass gauge, for me, it 
is an indicator that the table of the mouthpiece is not flat.  Once I 
fix that, it is easy to hold in place.  I hold the mouthpiece firmly to 
the glass with my thumb on the glass and my index finger wrapped around 
the mouthpiece in the place of a ligature (where the ligature would be 
placed on the mouthpiece).

If the table has a high spot (is convex) this can be a real challenge.  I
usually get away with rocking my thumb some toward the window to get some
stability.  I still get a cramp by the time I get to the last measurement.

But I have this problem only for the initial readings.  After that, my next
step is to flatten the table.  Then the gage is more stable.

I do it "by eye" looking perpendicular to the gage.  You need to be able to
look this way anyhow when taking readings off the feeler gages you put
(gently) in place.  

You could also grab your thickest feeler and use it as a "stop" against the
tip to set the zero there.

Hi Doug I take all my measurements at the same time.That way I don&#39;t
have to realign the mouthpiece every measurement.I use a set back and
with pratice I can come very close to the same spot every time.Keith had
a nice post on set back gages. As for it moving I dont think you holding
it hard enough.
