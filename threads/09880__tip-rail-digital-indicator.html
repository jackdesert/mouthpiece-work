 Hi Friends,
I´ve got the Jimmy Mitchell digital indicator. Once I´ve calibrated the machine on a flat surface I find difficult to measure the mouthpiece tip rail. If I do it twice it gives me two slightly diferent values. Is there any technique at grabing or sustaining the mouthpiece against the base and the measuring spike which could give me a more reliable measure?
thank you for replying me so quick to my last messages.

            <pre class='message__body'>   I have similar problems with my gauge and I think I know why, though I have not fixed it yet.  I have it mounted on a home-made right angle frame and I think the side where I lay the mouthpiece down is either a little too short or perhaps not firm enough.  I concluded this because it seems to give consistent results with the smaller mouthpieces, such as clarinet and soprano but can give quite variable measurements with anything longer.   I don&#39;t know if your gauge comes with a mounting or if you made your own.  Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>+/- .001 with the same gage is normal.  A pointed probe is more sensitive to 
where you place it on the tip rail.  It might change by .002-.003" if placement 
is not exact.  The Fowler gage has a probe that is like a flat screw driver 
end.  If you center it on the tip, this probe "finds" the inside of the tip rail 
better than a pointed probe.  But the pointed probe allows you to take other 
readings like baffle profile shapes.

 Hi Friends,

I´ve got the Jimmy Mitchell digital indicator. Once I´ve calibrated the machine 
on a flat surface I find difficult to measure the mouthpiece tip rail. If I do 
it twice it gives me two slightly diferent values. Is there any technique at 
grabing or sustaining the mouthpiece against the base and the measuring spike 
which could give me a more reliable measure?

I mostly use a machinists depth gage with a solid cylinder.  I use it so that 
only one edge is on the inside of the tip rail.

 I&#39;ve also thought that changing the probe on my gauge would give more consistent measurements. Mine has a hollow cylinder that   does not always touch the tip the same way each time.

Fran, the tip rail is at an angle to the table.  You must place the probe of the dial indicator at the same spot on the tip rail to have a consistent reading.  I try to measure about halfway between the middle of the tip rail and the outer edge.  I use a tip on the probe from Theo Wanne that has a very small ball shape so that it contacts the tip rail at a point, rather than the edge of a cylindrically shaped end.

Even then my readings will vary a thousandths or so.  And is it that important?  I find it more important to have a smooth radial curve with even side rails. I do try to have the tip measure my target measurement, but know that it can vary a bit as I repeatedly measure.

Paul.

            <pre class='message__body'> Good point. So that means that if one corner is different from the other the shape of the  tip curve  is at fault and not the tip opening.  Sometimes  the whole facing seems to have been applied slightly off, from the table onwards, which makes the tip rail always look a  little  unsymmetrical from corner to corner.   I have a bunch of new old stock Riffaults Ideals for clarinet. Most are good or easily fixable, but about a third of them are totally off center, as if the machine they used was not well calibrated. I have done one of these" off" ones  as an experiment and it took a lot of time and effort  to get it righted.     Fortunately, all the Ideal sax pieces I have acquired from the same lot are quite accurate  Peter.

Fran, the tip rail is at an angle to the table.  You must place the probe of the dial indicator at the same spot on the tip rail to have a consistent reading.  I try to measure about halfway between the middle of the tip rail and the outer edge.  I use a tip on the probe from Theo Wanne that has a very small ball shape so that it contacts the tip rail at a point, rather than the edge of a cylindrically shaped end.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Theo&#39;s ball tip is very small, like less than 1/16" in dia.  Virtually 
a dull point.

That&#39;s a good tip about the round point on the digital indicator a la Theo 
Wanne. 

  Instead of filling the  hollow tip on my  indicator with epoxy as Mojo 
suggested  I&#39;ll rummage through my bicycle ball bearing collection and epoxy  in 
a suitably sized one.
  I&#39;m getting a wealth of information from you guys today!   It&#39;s good to have 
access to the ideas of great and experienced minds.  The group effort is greater 
than the sum of its parts.  Peter

Peter, the ball tip from Theo Wanne is about the diameter of the ball in a ball point pen, perhaps a little larger, but in that size range.

            <pre class='message__body'>My dial indicator terminates in a tube with internal threads. It came with a
fitting with a small ball bearing about 2mm in diameter.  I found a small
machine screw that matched the thread, ground it to a conical point, and
used a small nut to adjust its position and fix it in place.

Of course, if your indicator isn&#39;t threaded inside the working end, this
isn&#39;t much help to you.
