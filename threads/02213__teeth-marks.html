Hi:

What I do is clean the mouthpiece, then run over the
tooth indention with 400 sandpaper.  If it is not too
bad, try 600.  When you see it done, you can have your
repairman polish it with a soft wheel,

BK

            <pre class='message__body'>Hello Tots,
if the tooth indentations are deep enought you can
prepare some powder of HR just grinding spare pieces
and put the dry powder inside the hole then put over
it a drop of cyanoacrylate (i.e.Attac) Wait one day
and after by a knife take out the material in excess.
If you polish correctly you get invisible repair.

Next, with some plastic polish on a soft cloth (I use Kit ScratchOut,

Finally, I finish the job with a clean thin adhesive patch.

            <pre class='message__body'>This has been a recurring issue (mostly brought up by me). Five minute epoxies almost all contain Bisphenol A, which is a known endocrine disrupter. There is currently a debate raging--the plastics and can industries (which are often lined with epoxy) say that it is safe in the quantities encountered, but there is research which challenges that assumption. I&#39;m personally staying away from oral contact with epoxies. You can do your own research online by doing a google search for Bisphenol And toxicity.

that has a stainless steel epoxy that they say is safe for use with food handling 
equipment. Other than that I don&#39;t know much about it. 

To fix missing bite plates on Otto Link  mouthpieces we&#39;ve been using a product from  
the dental (denture) industry it comes in a powder form with a separate bottle of 
liquid .It dries super  hard and clear.
