            It is possible that he has to many unread emails forcing the ISP to block new emails.
            He sometimes travel a lot but as soon as he is at the shop he catch up on those emails.
            I experience him as being very reliable , posessing integrity .   I know it is frustrating waiting but it should be worth the 
            wait.
