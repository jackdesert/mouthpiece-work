            <pre class='message__body'>I did my first clarinet mouthpiece last night, and now I&#39;m hooked.
The mouthpiece was stuffy, dull. I narrowed the rails substantially, 
and now the piece screams.  This is what I was looking for in a big 
band setting.  I got the courage to try this after reading posts on 
this site, and reading Eric Brand&#39;s repair manual.  Now I&#39;m dangerous.
Thanks to all the experts out there.

curve or other dimensions as well?  I&#39;ve checked through the archives 
for articles on clarinet mouthpieces, and I&#39;d like to get more info from
