            <pre class='message__body'>I did my first clarinet mouthpiece last night, and now I&#39;m hooked.
The mouthpiece was stuffy, dull. I narrowed the rails substantially, 
and now the piece screams.  This is what I was looking for in a big 
band setting.  I got the courage to try this after reading posts on 
this site, and reading Eric Brand&#39;s repair manual.  Now I&#39;m dangerous.
Thanks to all the experts out there.

            <pre class='message__body'>Did you just adjust the thickness of the rails or did you change the 
curve or other dimensions as well?  I&#39;ve checked through the archives 
for articles on clarinet mouthpieces, and I&#39;d like to get more info from 
anyone who has had success with them.  Non-radial curves?  Deliberate 
flat spots?  Tip openings & facing lengths?  Etc. etc.  Thanks.  I play 
quite a bit of clarinet, and I&#39;m using a Robert Scott mouthpiece (which 
works great), but I&#39;d love to modify some other pieces I have and see 
what can be done.

            <pre class='message__body'>Somewhere on our site is a nice pdf article from Santy Runyon written 
for a clarinet magazine in 1960.  It was a three part article, and dealt 
with various facing contours, including those with flats.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------Thanks, Paul. Yes, I saw the .pdf files in the clarinet section but haven't
been able to open them for some reason. I suspect they contain the info I'm
looking for, though.
