            <pre class='message__body'>We&#39;ve got an opening in our set up/repair facility in San Antonio for an

have the best equipped shop in the nation (pictures are at
www.orpheusmusic.com) and are a fun bunch to work with. Experience with
saxophones, clarinets, and flutes required. Any other skills are a plus.
Prima donnas&#39;, trainees, course repeaters, wannabe&#39;s, and course repeaters
need not apply. Our standards are high, and only qualified and well
experienced applicants will be considered. If you&#39;re a candidate (or know of
one), send a resume with your salary requirements (don&#39;t bother sending one
without salary requirements) to:

The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
