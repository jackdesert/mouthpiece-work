            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Rock and Roll bass mouthpiece.....</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>  I got my friends across the Great Waters to the West to provide me with
some hard rubber bass blanks
and have been working on a rock and roll specific bass mouthpiece with  very
narrow side rails, an extreme duck bill, etc. etc......I also narrowed the
portion of the mouthpiece that goes in the mouth considerably......this is
NOT a modified baritone piece, but a real bass mouthpiece with a proper
sized chamber. I&#39;m still in the experimental stage (this is for a well known
rock star, and of course, I&#39;ll make one for myself) and am interested to
know if anyone else has done any work along these lines. I put assorted
temporary baffles in it, but we were not happy with the results, as they
made the horn too thin sounding. It&#39;s not very pretty right now (I haven&#39;t
polished it) but I&#39;ll be happy to share some pictures if you will email me
OFF THE GROUP at saxgourmet@... and am more than willing to listen to
any advice......so far, it plays great, with a lot more bite and much
quicker articulation.
