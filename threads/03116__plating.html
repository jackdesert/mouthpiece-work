            <pre class='message__body'>I have been thinking about trying some plating (my finshed e-machine 
blanks and a couple of other pieces).  I checked out Keith&#39;s photos of 
nickel plating using what looks like a Caswell Plug&Plate rig.  The 
results looked quite good.  That or the Plug & Plate silver (at $31 and 
$38 respectively) look like an affordable first step.

- Does this method leave an even enough and thin enough plate for 
mouthpiece work?  I&#39;m thinking you&#39;d need the plating to be thick enough 
to be durable, but thin enough to not affect the dimensions of the 
mouthpiece (especially rails & tip).

- Nickel vs. chrome vs. silver?  (I&#39;ve read the existing messages on 
this subject - just wondered if anyone had additional experience or 
info).  Caswell also has a "Black Krome" or something like that, which 
sounds interesting...

- Do the electroless tank systems do a better job?  I think the nickel 
version is about $75.

- I assume that any of these methods would work fine on a piece with a 
bite plate - i.e., the plating wouldn&#39;t adhere to the plastic, just to 
the metal.

            <pre class='message__body'>My brush plating pics I posted on the Yahoo site were from a touch-up job,
not a total re-plate.

I did plate my 2 mouthpieces made from eMachineShop blanks using the
Caswell electroless Nickel plating kit.

Steve Fowler offered to do plating at attractive rates in a post a while
back.  So unless you just want to try plating for the fun of it, I would
send it off to Steve.
