            <pre class='message__body'>It seems to me that many of the hacked emails are broken into by someone who has hacked an easy to determine password or a short password. If you are smart enough to figure out the Excel spreadsheets, I hope you are smart enough to not use "password", "12345678" or ANYTHING in the dictionary as your password. The computer magazines have many articles lately on creating better passwords that you can actually remember. It seems like a common denominator is "the longer the better". (Yes, size does matter in mouthpiece facing and passwords!) It takes a computer with two graphics boards and a certain program a horribly short time to hack ANY 6 digit password, and not horribly long to hack an eight digit one either. Be creative and long winded. Rotate and do not use the same password all over, and you may be safe from hacking. If you store them on a piece of paper, keep them locked up and do not let your computer browser program save them either.

Not necessarily.  Some hackers use pretty sophiticated programs or social engineering to steal your user account and password from yahoo or yourself.  Doesn&#39;t really matter how simple or complex your password.

For example, you could receive an email from your bank wanting you to log in and do something in your account.  You click the link in the email, log in and...

But wait a damned minute!  That site that LOOKED like the banks was merely a copy of the HTML (easy) on a fake site that fooled you into thinking it was from your bank (or a business you buy from, or yahoo mail, or Paypal, etc).  When you "logged in" at the fake site you just gave them your user name and your 27 character password.  GOTCHA!!!

            <pre class='message__body'>Paul,
Phishing is usually listed after weak passwords and repeatedly used passwords in the computer tech articles. So if Mojo lets us warn others a bit, that was not a bad addition. Always log onto the site directly, not from a link in an email. If you fall for a phishing lure, and you use the same password for many accounts, you are in a cyber world of hurt. Once it goes that far, you might wish for a new identity.

As far as hacking or stealing your passwords, it is scary to think how easy it is to access your money online when organized crime is out there to trick or hack you with tools that are so easy to obtain.
