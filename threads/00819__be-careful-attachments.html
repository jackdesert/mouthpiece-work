            <pre class='message__body'>Friends:  A correspondent got an email with an attachement from me,
supposedly an article.  Do not open it.

"Paul, an email titled "Eager to see you" by sender "CINRAD75" just got
into
my inbox. There is no text in the message field. I&#39;m usually very
cautious
about emails like that, but this one contains an attachment that says
"the
following is an article by Paul Coats...""

Be warned.

Paul
