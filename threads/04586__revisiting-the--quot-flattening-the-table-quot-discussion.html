            <pre class='message__body'>Regarding mouthpieces that have a slight concavity of the table: I came 
across some information that casts some light on why this might be
desirable.

In his book "The Saxophone Reed", Ray Reed claims that after a reed has been
played a while, the edges of the underside of the reed begin to curve away
from the table, causing the reed to develop a slight convex cross-section.
He calls this "the primary warp", which he deems a natural consequence of
the reed being set in vibration. This convexity supposedly starts to appear
after the reed has been warmed up by playing for 5-10 minutes. This is why
reeds often improve after the bottom is re-flattened on a file or sandpaper.

This also suggests a reason why a slightly concave mouthpiece table might be
helpful - as the reed warms up, it will remain adequately seated.

His discussion pertains to cane, which I no longer use. I haven&#39;t yet
attempted to verify this observation on Fibracell reeds, but I think it
would be a worthwhile experiment to carry out both on cane and on the
Fibracells; i.e. to examine the cross-sectional flatness of the bottom of a
reed, play for 10 minutes, and then re-examine.

I suspect that this warpage might be greater along the actual vibrating part
of the reed, and become less pronounced at further distances towards the
heel - just a guess at this point.  (If Ray Reed has made this suggestion in
his book, I haven&#39;t seen it yet.)

A consequence of re-flattening the reed bottom will be that when the reed is
"cold", in what Mr. Reed calls its "static shape", the bottom of the reed
will become slightly concave; it winds up flat after it has warmed up to its
"dynamic shape."

As to the claim that the ligature will hold the reed flat, I&#39;m doubtful that
most ligatures are applies tightly enough; but perhaps a ligature that
applied pressure along the outside edges of the reed would have certain
advantages according to this theory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
I came across mention that Meyer &#39;Truflex&#39; mouthpieces in the 40&#39;s
were made with a deliberate hollow on the table.
They were unpopular and discontinued.

I feel that any curvature across the reed will have a damping effect
on lengthwise vibrations. Having said that, the lip pressure on the
heart of the reed must give a curving tendency across the reed , all
the way to the tip.
This is a long way from the table of course.
Perhaps a curve on the table will match the curve on the facing area
of the reed in its playing condition.
I am out of my depth here, but can&#39;t help wondering why harmonica
reeds are not curved.
It also means synthetic reeds might not curve so much and therefore
vibrate differently from wet swollen cane.      Eddie

            <pre class='message__body'>Interestingly, the traditional 2-screw ligatures primarily press the
edge of the reed down against the table.

I&#39;m not sure, but I think after 30-60 minutes a cane reed may get soft
enough that with certain ligatures it will conform to the table shape.  So
if the concavity is too deep, the reed will be forced into a more warped
shape.  If it is flat, it will be forced flat.  It is really not a big deal
unless there is a major leak.  You can play through minor leaks.

I prefer a flat table strategy.  I mostly play Fibracells, but my clients
play a lot of cane.   I have played concave tables that play great too.
