            <pre class='message__body'>I can probably sell some blanks; they&#39;re metal models of mine with cosmetic
flaws.  I&#39;m not sure exactly what I have right now but if anyone&#39;s
interested they can email me.

By the way, the material is pretty insignificant in determining the sound.
While the mouthpiece does vibrate a little, studies show that the amount in
too little to influence the sound.  Case in point, Bird&#39;s recordings on a
plastic sax.  Suggested reading for this in "Fundamentals of Musical
acoustics" by Bonade.

Much of manufacturing process is determined by costs but as laymen (of which
I consider myself)  we speculate a lot of stuff that simple isn&#39;t true and
no manufacturer will ever admit that they do a particular thing because it&#39;s
cheaper.  Not even me, well maybe I would but then again I&#39;m a horrendous
salesperson.

I know this may sound ludicrous but if you continue to work on mouthpieces
the eventually you&#39;ll see how to what degree the sound is determined by the
bore, baffle etc. and not the material.  I also suggest reading some books
on bells.  While they really have nothing to do with mouthpieces, the
manufacturing process is similar.  Casting, roughing, hand-finishing, and
polishing.

If anyone wants to make their own mouthpiece from a prototype I&#39;ll be happy
to help but be prepared to spend some money.  Sorry I haven&#39;t posted in so
long.  Everybody have a great day. Phil Barone
