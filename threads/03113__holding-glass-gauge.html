As a newbie I have found that the glass gauge loves to slide all over 
the place so I have to check my readings several times to make sure I 
didnt move it.  I have recently found that if I moisten the table very 
slightly it sucks down.  I dont think it changes any readings...at 
least my eyes dont see it.  Is this something that will cause a 
problem?  It seems to be helping considerably.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sounds like wetting it would be OK if it works.

I just use an iron thumb grip.  Really hurts sometimes.  If a table is
convex, it really gets tough to get an initial reading that is worth
anything.  Sometimes you need to take a few strokes to flatten the table
some first.
