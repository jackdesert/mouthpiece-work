            <pre class='message__body'>Folks,

Can we please cease quoting the entire thread in posts.  The group has
the threads.  No one needs to see the entire conversation and a post
of 10 words.

It clogs up the site and my inbox.

It wastes electrons.

Please, please, please...

M.

            <pre class='message__body'>IMHO, I actually prefer it the current way- I can delete all but the  
last message and have the entire conversation in one place.

"Can we please cease quoting the entire thread in posts. The group has

I second that emotion - for those of us who recieve these emails in a
daily digest format, it makes finding anything new after the first post
of the day into a time-consuming hunting excercise through vast swaths
of repeated text.

            <pre class='message__body'>But it is sometimes helpful if you will quote a short passage if that makes your reply more understandable.
