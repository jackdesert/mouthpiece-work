Cosmetics aside, can anyone give me any benefits to plating mouthpieces? I&#39;ve had a couple of questions today about why we don&#39;t offer plated finishes. One alluded to the mythical "brass poisoning" (I hope he doesn&#39;t have any brass plumbing fixtures in his home!) and another to wanting to match the horns finish. I&#39;m not aware of any non-cosmetic advantages or benefits. Anybody?

Having direct, prolonged contact with raw brass, on the thin oral membranes, combined with a continuous bath of warm saliva enzimes might pose more of a health risk than occasional contact with a calloused hand.  Raw brass is porous and can harbor bacteria.  More so a reed though.  Some people have allergic reactions.  Some don&#39;t.  What does your customer want?

            <pre class='message__body'>I mentioned the lead poisoning and I&#39;m staying behind that. The brass
plumbing by law can&#39;t contain lead- and should be only certain alloys of
brass. There is no law about mouthpieces though. If we know that even
minuscule quantity of lead are harmful and once in the system can&#39;t be taken
out why risking.  If you don&#39;t now which brass is used in your mouthpiece
plate it. The "Brass" is a very large field and specially in recent years
more and more manufacturers are offering lead free brasses. The big
companies prefer lead brass because it is cheap and very easy to work on and
doesn&#39;t destroy the tooling. The lead gives the smooth machining effect.
Lead free brass are little harder to work on and it is well noticeable
refacing both side by side but the good is beside the health benefits it
stays shiny much longer and some stay like that, so actually you don&#39;t need
to plate them.
Greetings to all,

Not even in your "lead alto" models?  Wouldn&#39;t that be false advertising?

      There is ABSOLUTELY no lead in the brass we use, and never has been.

Having direct, prolonged contact with raw brass, on the thin oral membranes, combined with a continuous bath of warm saliva enzimes might pose more of a health risk than occasional contact with a calloused hand.  Raw brass is porous and can harbor bacteria.  More so a reed though.  Some people have allergic reactions.  Some don&#39;t.  What does your customer want?

I would think that anyone who does not regularly clean their mouthpiece deserves verdigris.....it&#39;s really a personal hygiene issue,n IMHO. I can&#39;t identify any metals by taste, but most likely some people can.

The most significant benefit I can think of would be the elimination of  verdigris buildup (the green stuff) on the brass.  My extensively worked Otto Link has to be cleaned periodically on the table and facing.  Once I am finally 100% satisfied with my work (I&#39;m about 98% now) I will probably have it plated.  Some people might object to the taste of brass, too, but I find I get used to it quickly.

Cosmetics aside, can anyone give me any benefits to plating mouthpieces? I&#39;ve had a couple of questions today about why we don&#39;t offer plated finishes. One alluded to the mythical "brass poisoning" (I hope he doesn&#39;t have any brass plumbing fixtures in his home!) and another to wanting to match the horns finish. I&#39;m not aware of any non-cosmetic advantages or benefits. Anybody?

I like the feel of silver or gold plating on all of my metal mouthpieces. I bet stainless steel would be just as good, but I read how much of a pain it is to face. 

Plumbing fixtures and pipes can leach small amounts of lead overnight. I&#39;ve lived places where you are supposed to let the water run until cold first thing in the morning before cooking or drinking water from your kitchen faucet. 

Here are other municipalities who confirm the lead issue.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think so, since mouthpieces seem to favor some reeds over others.

It&#39;s pretty obvious that response is dependent both on the facing curve and
the curvature of the reed taper.

Fine adjustments on reeds make a great deal of difference. Getting a
mouthpiece to play with a brighter or darker sound is to some extent a
matter of fine adjustment of the reed.

For the synthetic reeds, this is especially useful, because they are long
lasting. It is worth spending a little extra time getting them to  respond
