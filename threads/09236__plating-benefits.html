Having direct, prolonged contact with raw brass, on the thin oral membranes, combined with a continuous bath of warm saliva enzimes might pose more of a health risk than occasional contact with a calloused hand.  Raw brass is porous and can harbor bacteria.  More so a reed though.  Some people have allergic reactions.  Some don&#39;t.  What does your customer want?

            <pre class='message__body'>I mentioned the lead poisoning and I&#39;m staying behind that. The brass
plumbing by law can&#39;t contain lead- and should be only certain alloys of
brass. There is no law about mouthpieces though. If we know that even
minuscule quantity of lead are harmful and once in the system can&#39;t be taken
out why risking.  If you don&#39;t now which brass is used in your mouthpiece
plate it. The "Brass" is a very large field and specially in recent years
more and more manufacturers are offering lead free brasses. The big
companies prefer lead brass because it is cheap and very easy to work on and
doesn&#39;t destroy the tooling. The lead gives the smooth machining effect.
Lead free brass are little harder to work on and it is well noticeable
refacing both side by side but the good is beside the health benefits it
stays shiny much longer and some stay like that, so actually you don&#39;t need
to plate them.

      this is where that "cleaning your mouthpiece" and "personal hygiene" stuff come into play.......True, some people have allergic reactions, but they represent a miniscule amount of the buying public. Those folks should consider another material if allergies are a problem. The customer who asked about brass poisoning was pretty vague. I just don&#39;t believe it is a significant problem. If it was, most of our water supply wouldn&#39;t come through brass fixtures and fittings.....

            <pre class='message__body'>I do not like the taste of raw brass and do not want my hands to smell like oxidized brass at a gig either. I like the feel of silver or gold plating on all of my metal mouthpieces. I bet stainless steel would be just as good, but I read how much of a pain it is to face. 

Plumbing fixtures and pipes can leach small amounts of lead overnight. I&#39;ve lived places where you are supposed to let the water run until cold first thing in the morning before cooking or drinking water from your kitchen faucet. 

Here are other municipalities who confirm the lead issue.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think so, since mouthpieces seem to favor some reeds over others.

It&#39;s pretty obvious that response is dependent both on the facing curve and
the curvature of the reed taper.

Fine adjustments on reeds make a great deal of difference. Getting a
mouthpiece to play with a brighter or darker sound is to some extent a
matter of fine adjustment of the reed.

For the synthetic reeds, this is especially useful, because they are long
lasting. It is worth spending a little extra time getting them to  respond
in a way that provides the sound one desires.
