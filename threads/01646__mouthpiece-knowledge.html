            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

Regarding an earlier message about learning to do mouthpiece work, I 
am more than willing to share the knowledge that I have with 
anyone.  I live near Washington, D.C., so if you&#39;re interested, come 
on by.  I&#39;ve found that there are two types of mouthpiece workers 
that I&#39;ve run into.  The one group won&#39;t tell you anything about 
what they do and the other group will tell you.  I&#39;m in the latter 
group.  I may not know as much as you, or I may know more, but I&#39;m 
sure we can learn something from each other.  I&#39;m more interested in 
offering quality work (whether it&#39;s me or someone else) for 
musicians than cornering the market.  I hope to hear from you!

Ben

            <pre class='message__body'>Red,

There are guys on this board who know more about
saxophone mouthpieces than you&#39;d think possible. If
they let on to knowing more, you&#39;d have to get
government security clearance to talk to them.

This is a great place for gaining and sharing
knowledge.It&#39;s an open minded bunch for sure.
