            <pre class='message__body'>I bought a terrible old Japanese "Nikkan" clarinet mpc for $10 a while ago. It wouldn&#39;t play for $#!%, but five minutes of work with some 1200 and 2000 grit sandpaper turned it into my preferred clarinet mpc. If the basic design of the mpc is OK and you or someone you know can reface it then a cheap Chinese mpc can end up being very good, but don&#39;t expect much out of the box.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Folks,
                 I was hoping that someone could help explain something I
just discovered about my old Berg Larsen (Metal) Tenor Mouthpiece...
 
It&#39;s marked as 130 / 0, with an M marking underneath and slightly off-set
from that... And I picked up this mouthpiece around 1989 or so... (I bought
it used)
The situation is this:
 
For several years, I had a really hard time finding a suitable ligature for
this mouthpiece... I&#39;ve ordered Berg Larsen ligatures, specifically for
their 0 table mouthpieces - to find that the ligature was too small for the
mouthpiece.
 
Until now - I&#39;ve used several different ligature configurations -- all of
them worked well, except for my insistent tightening. :)    
 
These configurations consisted of standard metal ligatures, designed for
hard rubber soprano sax mouthpieces...
 
The most radical set-up I had, which worked really well at that time - was
simply using a metal, cork-screw type hose clamp that you could find at any
hardware store. (I came up with this because my ligature stripped out right
before a gig, and all the music stores were closed....)
 
I know everybody has their own opinions on just how tight a lig should be -
but, for me, it always works for to place the lig as far back as possible,
and to tighten the lig as tightly as possible. The idea being that, by
placing the lig as far back as I do, I can get as much of the reed to
vibrate... and by tightening as much as I do - there is less loss of
energy/air. (at least, that&#39;s *my* theory)
 
Anyways - to get back to the subject:
 
I finally decided to play a hunch, and ordered another Berg Larsen
ligature... this time, the one specifically designed for the 2-3 table
mouthpieces...
 
Lo and Behold! That ligature works with my Mouthpiece!
 
The question is this: Did the design for the Berg Larsen mouthpieces change
so much that my 0 table mouthpiece, is now comparable to a 2 or 3 table for
their newer mouthpieces?
 
Or is this mouthpiece some sort of fluke? A mouthpiece with a mis-print?
 
Any thoughts would be most welcome...
 
Sincerely,
               Karsten J. Chikuri

I believe that most of the difference people find with different ligatures have to do with two factors: the compressability of cane and the flatness of the table. Different positioning of the pressure points of the lig on an unflat table will change the tip clearance quite noticeably, depending on which part of the unflat table the reed stock is clamped to. Further, a reed that is not perfectly flat will not sit at the same height when the clamping pressure is changed. This also applies to a flat (or unflat) reed clamped to an unflat table.

And as we all know, the tip clearance has a major impact on how the reed behaves.

Just a thought.  Berg designs vary a lot over the years.  

I can not confirm that a modern 0 baffle body size is different than a
modern 2 or 3 baffle body size.  I would think they would all be the same. 
But Berg is Berg.  We hope, but not a lot changes from owner to owner.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dear Toby,
                Although talking about placement of the ligature wasn&#39;t
exactly what I had in mind when I brought up this subject, I will say this:
 
You are most likely right about the reed not vibrating past the "break" of
the reed...
 
However, for whatever reason - at least for me, the reed does respond better
and I can get a little more "bark" out of the Tenor when I place the
ligature further back on the heel of the reed. Is it possible that what is
going on here is that I can get the reed to flex a little more... by placing
the "pivot point" further back?
 
I don&#39;t know.... I just know it works for me.

I don&#39;t know about your mpc, but basically the reed does not vibrate past
the end of the cut, and actually cannot even vibrate significantly past the
point where the side rails break from the table. If you have any doubts
about this attach an accelerometer and you will see. The myth of a lig
allowing the reed to "vibrate freely" ranks right up there with that about
materials making a difference in woodwind bodies.
 
I believe that most of the difference people find with different ligatures
have to do with two factors: the compressability of cane and the flatness of
the table. Different positioning of the pressure points of the lig on an
unflat table will change the tip clearance quite noticeably, depending on
which part of the unflat table the reed stock is clamped to. Further, a reed

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Questions regarding an Older Berg Larsen
Mouthpiece




Dear Folks,
                 I was hoping that someone could help explain something I
just discovered about my old Berg Larsen (Metal) Tenor Mouthpiece...
 
It&#39;s marked as 130 / 0, with an M marking underneath and slightly off-set
from that... And I picked up this mouthpiece around 1989 or so... (I bought
it used)
The situation is this:
 
For several years, I had a really hard time finding a suitable ligature for
this mouthpiece... I&#39;ve ordered Berg Larsen ligatures, specifically for
their 0 table mouthpieces - to find that the ligature was too small for the
mouthpiece.
 
Until now - I&#39;ve used several different ligature configurations -- all of
them worked well, except for my insistent tightening. :)    
 
These configurations consisted of standard metal ligatures, designed for
hard rubber soprano sax mouthpieces...
 
The most radical set-up I had, which worked really well at that time - was
simply using a metal, cork-screw type hose clamp that you could find at any
hardware store. (I came up with this because my ligature stripped out right
before a gig, and all the music stores were closed....)
 
I know everybody has their own opinions on just how tight a lig should be -
but, for me, it always works for to place the lig as far back as possible,
and to tighten the lig as tightly as possible. The idea being that, by
placing the lig as far back as I do, I can get as much of the reed to
vibrate... and by tightening as much as I do - there is less loss of
energy/air. (at least, that&#39;s *my* theory)
 
Anyways - to get back to the subject:
 
I finally decided to play a hunch, and ordered another Berg Larsen
ligature... this time, the one specifically designed for the 2-3 table
mouthpieces...
 
Lo and Behold! That ligature works with my Mouthpiece!
 
The question is this: Did the design for the Berg Larsen mouthpieces change
so much that my 0 table mouthpiece, is now comparable to a 2 or 3 table for
their newer mouthpieces?
 
Or is this mouthpiece some sort of fluke? A mouthpiece with a mis-print?
 
Any thoughts would be most welcome...
 
Sincerely,
               Karsten J. Chikuri

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Karsten,

I know that lig placement wasn&#39;t your primary question.

It might be interesting for you--if you have good vernier calipers--to measure the reed clearance at the tip with different lig placements. You might well find that it is slightly more open with the lig placed further back, especially if you tend to tighten the lig quite a lot.

  Dear Toby,
                  Although talking about placement of the ligature wasn&#39;t exactly what I had in mind when I brought up this subject, I will say this:

  You are most likely right about the reed not vibrating past the "break" of the reed...

  However, for whatever reason - at least for me, the reed does respond better and I can get a little more "bark" out of the Tenor when I place the ligature further back on the heel of the reed. Is it possible that what is going on here is that I can get the reed to flex a little more... by placing the "pivot point" further back?

  I don&#39;t know.... I just know it works for me.

  Sincerely,
                 Karsten J. Chikuri

    I don&#39;t know about your mpc, but basically the reed does not vibrate past the end of the cut, and actually cannot even vibrate significantly past the point where the side rails break from the table. If you have any doubts about this attach an accelerometer and you will see. The myth of a lig allowing the reed to "vibrate freely" ranks right up there with that about materials making a difference in woodwind bodies.

    I believe that most of the difference people find with different ligatures have to do with two factors: the compressability of cane and the flatness of the table. Different positioning of the pressure points of the lig on an unflat table will change the tip clearance quite noticeably, depending on which part of the unflat table the reed stock is clamped to. Further, a reed that is not perfectly flat will not sit at the same height when the clamping pressure is changed. This also applies to a flat (or unflat) reed clamped to an unflat table. The reed fibers will compress somewhat at the points of high pressure and again change the clearance of the part of the reed that does vibrate. And as we all know, the tip clearance has a major impact on how the reed behaves.

The 2 and 3 have a fatter body shape than the 0 and 1.

                    Thank you for your response!
 
You might be right about the table being convex, as I&#39;ve never checked to
see how flat the table is.
However, when I mentioned about why I place the lig as far back as I do - I
should&#39;ve also mentioned that it&#39;s
not because it&#39;s un-playable otherwise... it&#39;s playable wherever I place the
lig - the change, that I perceive, from &#39;normal&#39; placement
and that of my current &#39;heel&#39; placement is very subtle - but, the result
seems that the sound is a bit more open, with more power and a crisper
attack.
 
As far as the mouthpiece being mis-labled - it&#39;s hard to say. I also have a
Berg Larsen 85/2 metal mouthpiece, around the same vintage... the 85/2
mouthpiece is considerably &#39;fatter&#39;, as far as body shape, than the 130/0
that I use. 
 
I don&#39;t have a modern Berg mouthpiece to compare these two mouthpieces to -
so, I don&#39;t know how different vintage Berg&#39;s are to modern Berg&#39;s...

they create a low spot on each side near that spot.

  This is completely unsupported musing, but I wonder if placing the lig farther back might allow a small amount of air to pass between the reed and the table near the bottom of the window. That might simulate what some refacers do when they create a low spot on each side near that spot.

Apropo of your musing, I&#39;ve seen it suggested somewhere on the web that a
reed would play better with a layer of aluminum foil between it and the flat
part of the table. IIRC, it might have been a clarinet discussion board

I tried it on tenor, not to any alarmingly wonderful effect.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Dan,

Basically, if you look at the whole setup from the side, you will see that the reed sits flush way past the table--until the break at the side rails. A concave table is (AFAIK) just a low spot in the center of the table. The reed should still seal completely just below the window. If you are saying that some makers "hollow out" the center of the table including the area just below the window so that there is an empty space underneath the reed that connects to the chamber I have never seen this. But if this is so, I don&#39;t think it would have much effect as the extra volume of air there would be extremely small. And if it was leaking that would not help response for sure. I think that you will find that placing the lig far back has the effect of increasing the tip clearance, and this is what gives the reed its extra kick.

Very few makers and refacers use concave tables.  These are different than
the defective concave tables that come from mass production methods.  Good
concave tables seal around the perimeter of the reed and reed table.  They
may or may not seal at the base of the window "U".  

It is more common to find concave tables that have high spots at the table
heel and at the base of the window "U" (like Link STMs).

Recently the plastic thumb hook on my bari broke.  I looked online for a
replacement and found a website for a metal thumb hook, complete with
testimonials from players claiming it had improved their tone.  I thought of
you immediately, Paul, and the "added resonance from the copper band" one of
your clients claimed to have experienced.

I do perceive a slight difference with different ligatures, as I think we
all do, but I have no idea why...

I have actually gotten emails from students wanting to know if they changed
from their present silver plated lig to a gold plated one will make their
tone warmer.

materials making a difference in woodwind bodies.
 
I believe that most of the difference people find with different ligatures
have to do with two factors: the compressability of cane and the flatness of
the table. Different positioning of the pressure points of the lig on an
unflat table will change the tip clearance quite noticeably, depending on
which part of the unflat table the reed stock is clamped to. Further, a reed
that is not perfectly flat will not sit at the same height when the clamping
pressure is changed. This also applies to a flat (or unflat) reed clamped to
an unflat table. The reed fibers will compress somewhat at the points of
high pressure and again change the clearance of the part of the reed that
does vibrate. And as we all know, the tip clearance has a major impact on
how the reed behaves.

Mouthpiece

Dear Folks,
                 I was hoping that someone could help explain something I
just discovered about my old Berg Larsen (Metal) Tenor Mouthpiece...
 
It&#39;s marked as 130 / 0, with an M marking underneath and slightly off-set
from that... And I picked up this mouthpiece around 1989 or so... (I bought
it used)
The situation is this:
 
For several years, I had a really hard time finding a suitable ligature for
this mouthpiece... I&#39;ve ordered Berg Larsen ligatures, specifically for
their 0 table mouthpieces - to find that the ligature was too small for the
mouthpiece.
 
Until now - I&#39;ve used several different ligature configurations -- all of
them worked well, except for my insistent tightening. :)    
 
These configurations consisted of standard metal ligatures, designed for
hard rubber soprano sax mouthpieces...
 
The most radical set-up I had, which worked really well at that time - was
simply using a metal, cork-screw type hose clamp that you could find at any
hardware store. (I came up with this because my ligature stripped out right
before a gig, and all the music stores were closed....)
 
I know everybody has their own opinions on just how tight a lig should be -
but, for me, it always works for to place the lig as far back as possible,
and to tighten the lig as tightly as possible. The idea being that, by
placing the lig as far back as I do, I can get as much of the reed to
vibrate... and by tightening as much as I do - there is less loss of
energy/air. (at least, that&#39;s *my* theory)
 
Anyways - to get back to the subject:
 
I finally decided to play a hunch, and ordered another Berg Larsen
ligature... this time, the one specifically designed for the 2-3 table
mouthpieces...
 
Lo and Behold! That ligature works with my Mouthpiece!
 
The question is this: Did the design for the Berg Larsen mouthpieces change
so much that my 0 table mouthpiece, is now comparable to a 2 or 3 table for
their newer mouthpieces?
 
Or is this mouthpiece some sort of fluke? A mouthpiece with a mis-print?
 
Any thoughts would be most welcome...
 
Sincerely,
               Karsten J. Chikuri
