            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve read about the salt solution too, I think in relation to oboe
reeds.  I haven&#39;t tried it myself but it sounds like it should work. 
I use a simpler version of this which is somewhat along the same lines.

Use the Tupperware container with air-tight lid, but instead of the
salt solution, use a piece of folded up paper towel with a few drops
of mouthwash on it.  Every 2 weeks or so adda couple more drops of
mouthwash.  This prevents mold and keeps the reeds from drying out too
much, which reduces warpage and means the reed is ready to play
without prolonged wetting.

This has the advantage of being portable!
