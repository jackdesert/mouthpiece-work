                While I thought the sound of the orange piece was nice,
I REALLY liked the tone and the edge of the blue one. That’s the kind of
sound that I’ve been looking for out of a HR/Acrylic piece but have not
found… Let me know if you are going to be making more of those, I’d love
to get my hands on one…

Hi to everybody,
just received two new mouthpieces I personally designed few months ago.
I&#39;ve tried them and like both. I will keep the blue one for myself :)

The clips I was speaking for are only the first two named: Listen 1 
and Listen 2. I don&#39;t know what Peter is playing it is just a link to 
a youtube page to show the Grafton possibilities. Anyway I agree, 
Peter is great (whatever mpc he uses...)!!!!
