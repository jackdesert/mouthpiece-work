                While I thought the sound of the orange piece was nice,
I REALLY liked the tone and the edge of the blue one. That’s the kind of
sound that I’ve been looking for out of a HR/Acrylic piece but have not
found… Let me know if you are going to be making more of those, I’d love
to get my hands on one…

The clips I was speaking for are only the first two named: Listen 1 
and Listen 2. I don&#39;t know what Peter is playing it is just a link to 
a youtube page to show the Grafton possibilities. Anyway I agree, 
Peter is great (whatever mpc he uses...)!!!!
