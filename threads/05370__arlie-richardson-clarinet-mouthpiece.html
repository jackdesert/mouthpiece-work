            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

I had a client come into the shop yesterday for some facing work on an 
old mouthpiece he purchased in the late 50s or early 60s from the maker 
in the San Francisco Bay area.  On the mouthpiece was stamped: 

ArlieRichardson  The A and the R were very tall, and above the name, 
was "ccu" and "rated", so the AR spelled out both AccuRated and Arlie 
Richardson.  

Higher on the mouthpiece was stamped Artist Model.

This gentleman that brought in the mouthpiece is a doctor and amateur, 
but serious, musician.  So, he&#39;d played for 40 years on this mouthpiece 
with a very bad facing.  After fixing it, the mouthpiece sounded great.

Does anyone know who Arlie Richardson was?  Any information would be 
very interesting.  Thanks.
