            <pre class='message__body'>hello to all,
I have measured a tenor brilhart ebolin reworked by Doc Tenney.
This mpc has "hard rubber" stamped on the shank, a large round chamber and concave sidewalls; 
I know (from Mouthpiece heaven) round chamber is an original feature
but I was wondering if concave sidewalls are original or reworked from Doc Tenney...
any information would be much appreciated
thanks in advance.
ciao a tutti...

            <pre class='message__body'>I have 3 of vintage Brilhart tenors on my bench now with "Hard Rubber"
scripted on the shank.  They all have curved sidewalls like HR Links.
