            <pre class='message__body'>Originally posted by John on the MouthpieceWork group 3/20/10:

There has been a great deal said about calculating the volume and length of the missing cone.  My best efforts to do show have been shared on this forum and have been commented upon at length by the participants in this discussion.

There is an obvious disagreement between Lance and myself with regard to this topic.  My understanding of the disagreement is as follows:

-Lance believes that the missing cone should somehow be extrapolated from the geometry of the body.

-I believe that using the slope-length formula prescribed by Ferron with measurements from the neck produces satisfactory results for our purposes.

-Lance believes that the natural resonant frequency of the missing cone (without the neck) can somehow be calculated and tested by blowing on a mouthpiece with the part that goes on the neck cut-off and a narrow ring replicating the neck opening (he calls the constriction) inserted in the end.

-I believe that the calculated natural resonant frequency of the missing cone added to the length of the neck can accurately and adequately be derived from the formula Frs = xo/2L  given by Benade.  I also believe that the frequency of the mouthpiece plus neck when played with a "normal embouchure" can be accurately compared to this calculated frequency when and adjustment for end correction is made.  I also strongly believe that this method of testing the frequency by  playing the mouthpiece  on the neck is far more practical and allows a much greater degree of player control of the pitch than playing on a cut-off stub of a mouthpiece with a narrow ring inserted in the end.

-Lance believes the 1 mm gap between the base of the neck tenon and the bottom of the body tenon socket has significance in the calculation of the missing cone using the geometry of the body in the missing cone comparison study  that I conducted.  He thinks it should be treated as part of the neck for length and volume.

-I believe that the regardless of how the 1mm "gap" and its .445 ml volume are treated, that it makes no significant change in the findings of the study which were that the (large) missing cone extrapolated from the taper of the body minus the measured volume of the neck produces a missing cone that is far too large.   In fact, if the mouthpiece replicated a missing cone that size the played pitch on the mouthpiece + neck would have to be  close to Gb concert---a whole step lower.

It is clear to me that Lance and I cannot agree on these details and that further argument and bickering on these items of disagreement  is pointless and is beginning to annoy the neighbors.  

That said I would like to invite Lance (or anyone else for that matter) to take whatever instruments they have available and to 
try to find a way to calculate the volume and length of the missing cone for that saxophone as I have. To test that missing cone calculation I suggest that Lance come up with a way to play test the missing cone substitution and see if the frequency of the played substitution is a good match for the calculated frequency of the missing cone.  If he needs some old mouthpieces to cut up I have tons of them.  Just let me know.

Once this is study and testing is completed and the results posted here,  I will be more than happy to review and discuss those findings with him at that time.  I am not dropping out of the discussions entirely on this forum (sorry Steve) merely stepping aside from the circular arguments on the above topics that are going nowhere.

John

All unimportant.  John always appears to miss the point of my arguments entirely.  The first and most important thing I look at when examining such a study, is the integrity of the method, data, and analysis.  I could care less at that point, what the author&#39;s findings are.

Method: Does the author explain all means of data acquisition?  Exactly how were the measurements taken.  Using what tools exactly.  Where were measurements taken?  Were they averaged?  How was the mouthpiece lay opening plugged up while filling with water.  What problems did he have if any and what solutions were used?  What is the margin of error?  

John provided essentially no information in this regard. I asked these questions and many more, and for most, received no answer.  When I pressed him on how the body measurements were taken, he said he used a very precise expanding feeler/caliper combination and all the measurements were taken internally on 4 axis and averaged.  I then said that I was curious as to how he was able to measure the inside diameter of the base of the body, on 4 axis if he did not remove the bow section.  John then qualified his previous answer by admitted to measuring the outside of the tube and subtracting the thickness (of a thinned drawn tone hole rim) x 2 to get the diameter.  He stated further, that taking measurements was not an exact science and often "good approximations" were acceptable and that I was becoming annoying.

Data:  How is the data treated.  Is everything accounted for?  

John shows a 1mm section in the middle of the saxophone&#39;s working air column, which affects every single played note and each note&#39;s multiple resonances, throughout the instrument&#39;s entire range, yet it is not included in any of the study&#39;s calculations or analysis.  John&#39;s rational was, "It does not affect the outcome of the study."  Again, I&#39;m not concerned with the outcome of the study.  I&#39;m concerned about the integrity with which the data was handled and presented.  I want a crystal clear picture of everything and how it all fits together, including that which you wish to disprove, not just those things which directly support the author&#39;s viewpoint.  If the author does not treat all data seriously, we can infer that he also did not treat all data acquisition seriously.

Analysis:  Is the analysis logically valid?  Are there any contradictions with established fact or the author&#39;s previous findings or claims?  If so, does the author explain?  

MEVS:  John did one test with his Mouthpiece Equivalent Volume, with a set volume x.x of mouthpiece chamber used, which resulted in a 28% increase in volume.  From that one experiment, he concluded that any increase or decrease in mouthpiece volume used would result in a set 28% increase from the mouthpiece volume used.  That was a completely unfounded and logically invalid conclusion, but John went ahead and used it in his next Missing Cone Volume Study

MCVS:  While John admitted in the very little description of his method provided, that there was some margin of error in measuring the neck accurately (which I pointed out was a 9% error in volume, therefore strict use of the formula with the provided dimensions for frequency had to be inaccurate) he boasted in his conclusion that his method resulted in a volume match, to within 1%.

John then published his Neck Taper Study, showing the his alto neck is far from a straight tapered tube, and admits that there are problems in accurately measuring and calculating it&#39;s equivalent dimensions.

I pointed out to John his logical error in the MEVS, which made his MCVS study invalid, and he acknowledged his mistake.  He did another test which resulted in  different volume % increase, and then updated his MCVS. John modified some of the other data in the new MCVS, claiming more accurate measurements were taken, etc. and amazingly, despite the results of the Neck Taper Study and stated problems with accuracy, John claims that the results still show a match to within 1%.

In view of the above observations of John&#39;s undocumented methods, his treatment of ever-changing data, his acknowledging measurement/calculation problems and then claiming 1% final accuracy, his not infrequent use of logically invalid formulas both in his conclusions and prior posted discourse, and John&#39;s recent refusal to respond to questions, I can&#39;t help but get the feeling that the results he wants to get are just a little more important to him than how he gets them. 

This is the kind of critique that one gets when one publishes scientific stuff and John should not take it personal.  He&#39;ll get his chance to return the favor.

As I said in a previous post, I am not going to get into an endless circular argument with you on anything you have written below.  I am still anxious for you to actually do some measurements, computations, and playing tests yourself to compare your results with mine.

            <pre class='message__body'>Have it your way Lance.  I will discuss my continuing acoustic work with Toby and others who are able to disagree without the accusatory and backbiting comments.  Good luck with your own experiments, measurements, and studies if you ever get around to actually doing something rather than just nit picking the work of others.  Have a nice day.

> I need to clear the air with Lance about some things.Â  I thought my previous response would suffice, but I am not the type of person who is able to justÂ  let this type of thing pass.Â  In hisÂ  response below Lance openly questioned my honesty and integrity in the way I conducted my studies and calculated the results.Â  I find his insinuations to be very offensive and totally uncalled for.Â  He would do well to remember that none of us here are trained scientists including himself, and these informal studies are not being published for peer review in the "Journal of Acoustic Science" they are written in a mouthpiece discussion forum to share information and generate ideas.Â Â
