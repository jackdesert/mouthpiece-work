            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m wondering what the theories and practices are out there regarding
finishing hard rubber tables and facing curves.  I&#39;m finding what I
understand to be a typical procedure--a pass or two on the back of
clean sandpaper, which leaves the surface almost shiney smooth--also
leaves it more susceptible to inconsistent repeat measurements after
use, particularly at the facing break.  Seems that if instead I finish
the table and facing off with a couple passes on, say, 1000 grit
wet/dry paper, the slightly porous surface lends more consistency
later on.  Anyone have similar experience?

            <pre class='message__body'>I think it would be better if you were to finish it off with sand 
paper.  I find that this also gives the ree a slighty better grip on 
the table.
