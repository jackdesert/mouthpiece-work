All things with regard to interior dimensions being equal, it is my observation that hard rubber mouthpieces are generally manufactured significantly larger
 than a corresponding metal mouthpiece. I can&#39;t find a good explanation for this based on necessity or science. Any ideas?

    I have a much re-layed rubber Larsen which &#39;rings&#39; and it STARTED off slimline.
    I seem to remember Otto Link stating that their Tone Edge was &#39;fat&#39; to improve the tone. This was probably more to do with the chamber size increasing the dimensions though.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Bill&#39;s post on this seems the most likely.

Historically, what were the early saxophone mouthpieces made of? Wood?
Ivory? Something else?  Whatever the material, it would have dictated
certain dimensions for stability and strength. Maybe these dimensions
became "standard."

The discovery of curing rubber by vulcanization with sulfur only occurs
about the same time as the invention of the saxophone, so it&#39;s unlikely
that the stable form of hardened rubber used in mouthpieces was available.

What slender profile hard rubber mouthpieces are on the market? The former
Ponzol Custom, a hard-rubber version of the M2, had a slender profile.
Others?

The process was discovered pretty well simultaneously by Charles Goodyear in
USA and Thomas Hancock in England at around the same time, 1839. Both
discovered the use of white lead and sulphur as a vulcanization system for
Natural Rubber.

Thin shelled hard rubber mouthpieces are not a new item. The Gregory Master
and Morgan Excaliber are a few examples. With regard to a peashooter
designed hard rubber piece see the Ponzol Custom.

As most of us who have excavated too much material from a chamber know,
there comes a point of diminishing returns. A mouthpiece that is too thin is
also a dead sounding mouthpiece.

According to my research, Charles Goodyear accidently discovered the
