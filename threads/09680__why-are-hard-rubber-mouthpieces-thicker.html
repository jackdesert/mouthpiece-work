            <pre class='message__body'>I would assume it is a matter of the relative strength of the materials, as well as their weight.  The thick shank of a rubber muthpiece is required for strength -- they sometimes crack as is!  A metal mouthpiece made in the same thickness would be impractically heavy, and unnecessarily so, since sufficient strength can be obtained with much thinner material.

All things with regard to interior dimensions being equal, it is my observation that hard rubber mouthpieces are generally manufactured significantly larger
 than a corresponding metal mouthpiece. I can&#39;t find a good explanation for this based on necessity or science. Any ideas?

    I have a much re-layed rubber Larsen which &#39;rings&#39; and it STARTED off slimline.
    I seem to remember Otto Link stating that their Tone Edge was &#39;fat&#39; to improve the tone. This was probably more to do with the chamber size increasing the dimensions though.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think Bill&#39;s post on this seems the most likely.

Historically, what were the early saxophone mouthpieces made of? Wood?
Ivory? Something else?  Whatever the material, it would have dictated
certain dimensions for stability and strength. Maybe these dimensions
became "standard."

The discovery of curing rubber by vulcanization with sulfur only occurs
about the same time as the invention of the saxophone, so it&#39;s unlikely
that the stable form of hardened rubber used in mouthpieces was available.

What slender profile hard rubber mouthpieces are on the market? The former
Ponzol Custom, a hard-rubber version of the M2, had a slender profile.
Others?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thin shelled hard rubber mouthpieces are not a new item.  The Gregory Master and Morgan Excaliber are a few examples. With regard to a peashooter designed hard rubber piece see the Ponzol Custom.

As most of us who have excavated too much material from a chamber know, there comes a point of diminishing returns.  A mouthpiece that is too thin is also a dead sounding mouthpiece.

According to my research, Charles Goodyear accidently discovered the vulcanization process in 1838.  It is difficult to determine when hard rubber became commonly used. Wood saxophone mouthpieces carried over from the early clarinet mouthpiece. But rubber was found to be a more stable material.

The process was discovered pretty well simultaneously by Charles Goodyear in
USA and Thomas Hancock in England at around the same time, 1839. Both
discovered the use of white lead and sulphur as a vulcanization system for
Natural Rubber.
