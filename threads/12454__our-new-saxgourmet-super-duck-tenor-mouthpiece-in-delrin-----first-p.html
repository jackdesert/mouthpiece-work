            <pre class='message__body'>Here&#39;s your first look at our new Super Duck tenor mouthpiece in Delrin.....no, the production models won&#39;t be black.....you guys know me better than that! Many thanks to the CNC wizards at EMR Machine....those guys are absolutely the best! There are lots and lots of posers and wannabe’s out there claiming to make better saxophones and saxophone accessories…..talk is cheap…..we’re actually doing it!

This is a 100% made in USA product…..we have quite a few other new mouthpiece models we will be introducing this year…..all in Delrin

When better saxophone products are needed, we will make them

The Saxgourmet Super Duck has a long cliff baffle, a very pronounced “duck bill” beak, and a long (52) pure radial facing curve
