            <pre class='message__body'>Here’s our all new Super Duck tenor mouthpiece, shown with our Dragon’s Tongue for comparison…..please note the differences in beak, baffle, and chamber…..both have a threaded tone chamber and solid brass shank weights and are machined from a solid bar of Delrin. Deloris has the very best acoustic qualities for saxophone mouthpieces on the planet! Lots of people claim to be advancing the science of saxophones. Talk is cheap. We’re actually doing it rather than just talking about it.
