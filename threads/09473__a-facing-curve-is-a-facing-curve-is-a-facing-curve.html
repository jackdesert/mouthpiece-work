            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: a facing curve is a facing curve is a facing curve...?</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a question about the spreadsheet files posted in the files area. In the Alto directory, there is a "Meyer Alto" sheet that shows many different facings for alto pieces. In the Tenor directory there is a "Link Tenor" sheet with similar info. 

The question is, can the Meyer Alto facing measurements be used on an Otto Link alto mouthpiece, or for that matter, other brands? Or does each brand have specific sets of numbers unique to those brands? Same question for the Link Tenor sheet.

Thanks.
Doug

            <pre class='message__body'>I think the Link spreadsheet uses the Link tip opening scale and the Meyer uses 
the Meyer scale.  But if you just talk about tip openings in inches, you can use 
them for any mouthpiece.
