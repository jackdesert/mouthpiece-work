            <pre class='message__body'>Friends, Just got word, Santy is doing better, and is expected to
recover.  His breathing is easier, and he is feeling better.

As for now though, the party is still postponed... but NOT cancelled.
Will let you know when it is rescheduled.

Please don&#39;t flood their phone with calls.  Thanks.
