Thanks. 

But do you mean a "file card"? 

On google, there are no
results for searching the quoted phrase "engineer&#39;s scratch card", and
only 2 irrelevant results for the phrase "engineers scratch card"

            <pre class='message__body'>There is a tool that is a brush on one side and sort of a stiff wire brush on the other. I think this is called a file card for some reason. Some opinions are that the wire brush side dulls files and a piece of hardwood was recommended for unclogging. I tried it and found that the wood works well.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve looked for a reference for it, but can&#39;t find it online. I bought a 
roll many years ago, so haven&#39;t needed to buy it since, so perhaps it&#39;s 
a product that no longer exists. To describe it, imagine a length of 
stiff, but still flexible material consisting of several layers of a 
dense woven hessian material sandwiched with layers of latex. The whole 
length is studded with densley applied metal staples punched through 
from one side only in close-set rows. They are held in place by the 
latex and one side of the material presents something like a dense metal 
brush.

I&#39;d seen the use of a piece of hardwood to unclog, and this does
work on a flat file; but is not very applicable to riffler files with
various curved surfaces 

I tried a vinegar soak (suggested somewhere
online), which blackened the files a bit, but didn&#39;t seem to accomplish
anything else. 

I&#39;ll probably just buy a new set.

            <pre class='message__body'>Regarding the question of how to unclog files...

I&#39;ve been taught to use the &#39;file card&#39; (stiff wire brush made for cleaning
files)...
or if that doesn&#39;t work, use a piece of the same material that you&#39;re
filing to drive the pieces out from between the teeth.

Hold the file flat on the bench, push the end of the piece of material hard
against the file, parallel to the teeth, driving the filings from between
the teeth.

Like materials work best: Steel for steel, brass for brass etc.

Hope that helps.
