            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,

Does anyone have a source for "stainless steel" feeler gauges?

I&#39;ve gotten feelers at various auto-parts stores, etc - but none of
them are stainless steel. They&#39;re usually covered in oil to prevent 
rusting. before using, I have to wipe all the oil off, otherwise the 
feeler gauge will stick to the glass gauge as I drop it in between 
mouthpiece and glass gauge.

Then, If I&#39;m not going to use them for a while (like, a few days or a 
week) - I have to coat them in oil again, or wrap them in an oil-
soaked rag - to they don&#39;t start to rust.

Invevitably, I leave them out for a few days (or few weeks), on my 
workbench - in the basement - and they eventually start to rust, 
which causes incorrect readings.

Does anyone have a source for "stainless steel" feelers??

Thanks in advance,
regards,
Peter

            <pre class='message__body'>McMaster-Carr.  I got a couple sets 6 months ago and have still not 
put them to use.  The ones I use are plated but are starting to 
rust.  I still can do good work with them so I have not been 
motivated to change yet.
