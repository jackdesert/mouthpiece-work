            <pre class='message__body'>I bought 2 pkg of black rubbery mpc patches on ebay - sized for tenor or
alto. "Jinxing" brand.

Too thick for me, too soft. If someone likes this style, send me your
address, I&#39;ll mail them, they&#39;re not doing me any good. U.S. Only, sorry.

First come first serve.

I also recently bought a sample of polyurethane "helicopter tape." Although
allegedly very tough stuff, it took a tooth impression immediately. I prefer
a hard slick mpc surface without any give.
