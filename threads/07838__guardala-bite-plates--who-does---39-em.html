            <pre class='message__body'>I think you&#39;re talking about dental acrylic, not epoxy.  I use the acrylic for bite plates and it works great - just make sure you have massive ventilation (like, do it outdoors) because the fumes are very hazardous.  The acrylic sets up with the powder/liquid mix, but I think the epoxy needs UV or heat.  There are a bunch of old posts about both materials.

  Yes, it is not an epoxy. I found something on the web last year that indicated that it is a Methyl Mathacrylate Cement and a cross-linked acrylic (whatever that means).

  The brand name is Kerr Fastcure.

My dentist years ago gave me some stuff called "DuraLay" which uses methyl methacrylate as the liquid component.  Don&#39;t know what the powder is.

It works really well for baffle material, and is hard enough that it could be used for bite plates as well.  It comes in red (pink) and blue colors.
