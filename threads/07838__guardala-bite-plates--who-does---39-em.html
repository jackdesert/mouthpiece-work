            <pre class='message__body'>I do, for one.  The material was sold on eBay a few years ago by dudley auctions or something like that.  Its a pink powder with a clear liquid activator.  I have searched for the brand name of this dental epoxy, but I do not think it is available anymore or is not sold under that name.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think you&#39;re talking about dental acrylic, not epoxy.  I use the acrylic for bite plates and it works great - just make sure you have massive ventilation (like, do it outdoors) because the fumes are very hazardous.  The acrylic sets up with the powder/liquid mix, but I think the epoxy needs UV or heat.  There are a bunch of old posts about both materials.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, it is not an epoxy.  I found something on the web last year that indicated that it is a Methyl Mathacrylate Cement and a cross-linked acrylic (whatever that means).

The brand name is Kerr Fastcure.

            <pre class='message__body'>I used nail acrylic powder with the liquid activator (purchased from a beauty supply store) on a guardala bite plate and the result was the same as the pink dental acrylic, only an opaque whitish appearance.  Once it hardens, I believe the health risk is the same as dental acrylic, little to none.

            <pre class='message__body'>Can you check if your nail acrylic is a Methyl or Ethyl Methacrylate?

            <pre class='message__body'>The liquid uses methacrylate; made by Beauty Secrets Ordorless, acrylic nail system powder and liquid.  2 parts.  very strong smell when mixed; it took at least 24 hours to cure; 48 hours to get to final hardness but feels very comfortable; better than the black bight plates.  inexpensive.  bonds well to the laser trim guardala i used it on; i wonder if it could be used as a baffle material.

My dentist years ago gave me some stuff called "DuraLay" which uses methyl methacrylate as the liquid component.  Don&#39;t know what the powder is.

It works really well for baffle material, and is hard enough that it could be used for bite plates as well.  It comes in red (pink) and blue colors.
