            <pre class='message__body'>I have a florida tenor stm 5* that i have tried to open up; 
presently the tip opening is .095 and the schedule 
is .17, .22, .27, .37, .48.  Low notes to C# before high D are fine 
but the upper register is very thin. Your thoughts or suggestions. 
TIA. mike collins

            <pre class='message__body'>Assuming you are using the Erick Brand feeler set 
(.0015, .010, .024, .034, .050), it looks to me (after plotting the 
curve) that the facing is too flat near the tip.  It even looks 
slightly concave.  It would help to have a feeler gauge reading 
between your last .050" feeler and the tip opening at .095".  This 
area deals with the higher note response.

For a simple tweek, you can try changing the facing to 48, 37, 28, 
23, 17 and a tip opening of .100".  Just avoid cutting the 17 area 
any more and the changes I suggested will give you a little more 
curvature where I think you need it.  

If it is a little too resistant, the next move would be to shoot for 
48, 37.5, 28.3, 23.4, 17, .100" tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>I just added a file of my analysis of the measurements supplied in 
posts 2007 and 2010.  It is called "Chedoggy FL Link" and is in the 
Files - Methods area on the Yahoo site.

The .050" feeler measurement of 17 looks way out.  Perhaps it should 
be 12?  I occassionally record numbers that are off by 5 or 10 but a 
plot of the data really illustrates where the bad readings are.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, I tripled checked the measurement and it still reads 17.  In 
fact, I checked two other tenor mouthpieces that I have worked on 
and they had similar readings. The schedule you diagramed is so 
extreme I wonder if I am doing something terribly wrong.  Let me 
know if you would be willing to take a look at the piece (for your 
customary charge of course) and I will send it over to you.  I live 
in eastern pa not to far from you. thanks, mike
