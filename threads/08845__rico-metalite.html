            <pre class='message__body'>Hi folks,

I thought I would change the discussion a little, since I think the same couple of topics have been beaten upon for the last couple of weeks...

I have been under the impression that the Rico Metalite line had been discontinued back in the &#39;90s. Around 2003, I found that Brook May Music had a small remaining stock of M5 tenor mouthpieces, so I bought the remaining stock they had--four M5 mouthpieces.  The Metalites are great performing mouthpieces for a bright sound.  They are cheap (about $20-25) and are quite responsive. With a high baffle, they are very easy blowing.  I have found that they work really well for C Melody tenors.  I play mostly C Melody and they work great for me.  They have a small-ish chamber and a very high baffle.  It kind of reminds me of the silverlite Dukoffs, but with a baffle that drops more dramatically into the chamber.  With a Metalite on a C Melody, I get sort of a lead alto sound, but you also have a lushy low register too.

I&#39;ve noticed lately on ebay that Metalite mouthpieces have been showing up more often.  A seller was offering a bunch of M7 and M9 tenor pieces for about $22 USD at a buy it now.  So I thought I would give it a shot.  About 6 months ago, Metalites were pretty scarce on ebay and people were asking $50 or $60 for them.

The M7 and M9 mouthpieces showed up yesterday and when I opened the package, I was surprised that the box the mouthpiece was in, was not red.  Instead, it was in a white box.  I was thinking what is this???  I&#39;ve never seen a Metalite in a white box... It says Metalite on the box and there is an M7 and M9 on it as well. Then a thought came racing to mind--Did Rico reissue the Metalite mouthpieces??!?!?  I know there are a lot of people out there wondering why Rico discontinued the Metalites when they worked so well.  When I looked at the box more closely, it had a copyright of 2009!  I went to the ricoreeds.com site and sure enough, under the mouthpiece-saxophone section, the Metalite mouthpiece is listed next to the Grafonite mouthpiece.  On the Rico site, the Metalite is listed as $29 USD.  You can buy directly from Rico!  WOW!

So what has changed?  The reissued mouthpiece looks very similar to the old Brillhart design if not exactly like it.  It is gray just like the original.  However, they are using a hard plastic now where the old one had a softer, waxy plastic.  I remember trying to reface the old ones and it would sort of gum up the sandpaper.  I also noticed that the new mouthpiece is now labeled Rico where as the old mouthpiece was labeled Rico Royal; like the Grafonites.  There were actually two different style Rico Royal versions. I think the earlier ones had a textured outside surface and later Metalite mouthpieces had a smooth outside surface.  I have both. I prefer the smooth surface. The reissued Rico Metalite also has a smooth outer surface.  The older Rico Royal Metalites came in M5, M7, M9 and M11.  I think the tenor M5 had a 0.095" tip opening, M7 - 0.105", M9 - 0.115" and M11- 0.125"  The reissued Rico Metalites only comes in M5, M7 and M9. You can
 only get M9 in the tenor and bari versions.  The soprano and alto versions only come in M5 and M7.  I have not measured the  tip openings of the new Metalites yet.

I&#39;m not sure if there is anyone out there that is excited about the reissue or not. I thought it might be interesting to bring it up, so that you can now try out this legendary Arnold Brillhart designed mouthpiece if you haven&#39;t already. Unless you are buying the original Rico Royal Metalite, DO NOT PAY $50 or $75 for it.  You can get a new Rico Metalite for $25 or $30.  These mouthpieces make great blanks too.  If you are new to facing a mouthpieces, you can get a couple to fiddle around with.  There is a lot of material in the baffle and you can carve it up to experiment with baffle and chamber designs.

I also have a Rico Royal version M11 soprano Metalite for my C soprano sax.  It works well on that horn too.

OK, back to your discussions....

Regards,

Willis

There is no limit to the number of subjects that can be discussed simultaneously and no subject (other than administrator subjects) has priority over any other.

Say you went to a dinner party with lots of people, all sat at one big table. During the dinner, would you wait for the person to your left, conversing with the person on their left, on a subject that you found uninteresting, to stop talking before you attempted conversation with the person on your right, on a topic of your choosing?  I doubt it.  If you didn&#39;t wait, would you feel obligated to address the people on your left, and apologize for doing so, or to comment on what you thought of their conversation?  Probably not.

I still do not mind the acoustic discussions.  I am a little disappointed that the science is not presented well enough in the papers and books that those interested can agree on how to apply it.  I had hoped that a few spot tests would resolve the disagreements.  But then there are disagreements on those too.

My favorite soprano mouthpiece right now is an M9 Metalite that has had some

change the facing. I had to cut it shorter, though, because I had to jam it
way way onto the cork to get it to play in tune.

I&#39;ve been wanting to try to duplicate it, in order to have a back-up, so
it&#39;s nice to know they&#39;re available again.

I always wondered why they stopped selling these. AFAIK, they were the only
high-baffle, low price plastic mouthpiece on the market.

My favorite soprano mouthpiece right now is an M9 Metalite that has had some
baffle modifications (combined with a Hahn synthetic reed.) Didn&#39;t need to
change the facing. I had to cut it shorter, though, because I had to jam it
