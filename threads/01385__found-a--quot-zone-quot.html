            <pre class='message__body'>I have been hacking away at a Bundy II and an old Selmer - tenor
pieces... 
I got the Bundy to a nice 48/.95 and she plays like a dream on 2.5 ricos.
But doesn&#39;t play so well on 2&#39;s.
I noticed the same behavior out of my Morgans (6 and 7) - the 6
matches well with 2.5&#39;s the 7 with 2&#39;s. This must be "my zone" as far
as my optimum opening for best sound...
It may be hard for me to test MP&#39;s that have a greater tip opening or
smaller tip if this is the case, because they just wouldn&#39;t sound as
good as with a gap related to the .095/rico 2.5 category...
Now I have been playing for many years and follow the loose
embrouchure crowd and I am able to adjust quite readily, but seem to
have stumbled on a possible weakness.
Will this affect my ability to alter MP&#39;s for a given player???

Patrick
