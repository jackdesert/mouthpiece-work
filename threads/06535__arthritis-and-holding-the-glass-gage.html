I once tried using a Rovner ligature to hold a glass gage to a mouthpiece.  But I found that I got different readings from this arrangement.  I guess it actually warped the glass slightly.  
 I would look for a clamp solution that mimics the way a thumb holds the gage.  It needs to allow for different size mouthpiece bodies.  So a cam-action (vise grip), screw (C-clamp), or spring might work.  Plastic would be better to get the weight down.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hello jorns: (sorry i d&#39;nt speak English)

i lament your arthritis; maybe you can have too much sugar in blood 
and erroneus diet. Your problem can be irreversible if you ignore it.

Respect your handiwork, (that is mine too) you can enconunter 
solution with a few of imagination, (that i am sure you have and 
large) and a strip of EVA gum of 3 mm thickness. For example: Strip 
of 30 mms. of wide X sufficient length to embrace, more than 
enough,both things.

At the extrem of this strip you can glue a morsel of sintetic thorn 
or thistle, coincident in place in which you have to fit well the 
ensemble mouthpiece table - glass gauge.

In general adjust that is very uncomfortable for all us, isn&#39;t it?

Good Luck, and principally, be carefull with your body please.

Fraternally

dozen pieces or more, my hands get tired too!!
I use a small C clamp for this.  I have put self adhesive felt padding
on the areas that touch the glass and mouthpiece so that they don&#39;t
scratch.  It is a bit tricky to get used to setting up the thing, but
it makes things a lot easier.
I highly suggest getting a good c-clamp; not the kind at a dollar
store.  The bolt on the cheap ones does not fit the hole well and will
wiggle a lot.  When you get one, be sure that the bolt doesn&#39;t wiggle;
it is worth the extra few dollars.
Rubber bands never worked for me because the glass would never stay
straight unless I held it all in place... which really defeats the
purpose altogether.
