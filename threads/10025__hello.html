            <pre class='message__body'>Hello Mr. Bradbury, Thank you for allowing me in your group. I am an old toolmaker who plays the guitar. I walked into our local music store to look around. I started talking to the owner and asked if there was anything I could do to start repairing instruments. I have built one guitar and have two in the works. Rick held up a mouthpiece and asked if I could make these. I said yes.  The convesation led in the direction of refacing and I told him I was sure I could do it. He brought out a brass Link and said it doesn&#39;t play at all see what you can do with it. I just completed my third mouthpiece in two  weeks and have the fourth on the counter waiting. 
    This is more challenging (and fun) than tweaking a harley.  Everything done leads to more questions as you try to get the best performance from the piece. I am grateful to you and everyone that has posted because I have gleaned much information from you all. I will be starting to play as soon as I get a sax. Rick says he will help me out with that.....     Guy
