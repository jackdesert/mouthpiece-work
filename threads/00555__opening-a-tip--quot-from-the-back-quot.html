            <pre class='message__body'>I have a mpc with a nice rollover baffle that I&#39;d like to have opened 
up some, but I don&#39;t want the tip rail or baffle configuration to 
change.  I seem to recall Doc Tenney posting on SOTW that you can 
increase the tip opening by sanding down the table from the back, and 
altering the angle of the table.

Has anyone had any success with opening a tip by changing the angle 
of the table, without actually touching the tip rail and baffle?

Thanks!

            <pre class='message__body'>I can only imagine.  Seems like you&#39;d have to alter the facing curve too.  
Otherwise you end up with a shorter, steeper curve relative to the table 
angle.

But what other option is there if you want to maintain the integrity of a 
rollover baffle?  The mpc in question is only made in one facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>What you normally do is rework the first 1/8"-1/4" of baffle, keeping a
similar contour to before.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have tried this some.  You still need to reface the tip some, but 
you can minimize the amount by changing the angle of the table.  It 
is a great technique to use when you have to open a mouthpiece a 
lot.  Otherwise, it looks like you really butchered up the tip.

But like Paul said, the normal method is to simply rework the baffle 
to get it back to where it was.
