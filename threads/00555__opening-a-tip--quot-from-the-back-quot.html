            <pre class='message__body'>I have a mpc with a nice rollover baffle that I&#39;d like to have opened 
up some, but I don&#39;t want the tip rail or baffle configuration to

increase the tip opening by sanding down the table from the back, and

Has anyone had any success with opening a tip by changing the angle 
of the table, without actually touching the tip rail and baffle?

Thanks!

Otherwise you end up with a shorter, steeper curve relative to the table 
angle.

But what other option is there if you want to maintain the integrity of a 
rollover baffle?  The mpc in question is only made in one facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have tried this some.  You still need to reface the tip some, but 
you can minimize the amount by changing the angle of the table.  It 
is a great technique to use when you have to open a mouthpiece a 
lot.  Otherwise, it looks like you really butchered up the tip.

But like Paul said, the normal method is to simply rework the baffle 
to get it back to where it was.
