            <pre class='message__body'>Hi everyone,


Im currently using a 0.23 inch thick glass plate as my work surface and was wondering if it will be okay for mouthpiece work... or will it be subject to flexing?

Cheers,

            <pre class='message__body'>My experience is that glass this thin, 6 mm / 1/4" will flex when pressure is applied to it, such 
as flattening the table.  I can place my digital tip gauge on thin glass, press near it and see 
the reading change.

My glass plate is 1/2" or 12-13 mm.
