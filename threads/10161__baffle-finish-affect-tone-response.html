As I mentioned, I am aware that there are many factors besides the baffle. I also suspected that there would be some change to the rails over playing time. The late Everett Matson used to reface mouthpieces that had been well used because the rails would develop a "tilt" as he called it which would not give the reed a nice flat rail upon which to sit. I have perceived the difference in tone/feel with some hand finished mouthpieces as well. I came to think about this because it seemed that perhaps it was more prevalent in the mouthpieces that were more polished in the interior.

            <pre class='message__body'> Mattson was right about a "tilt". This is especially true for clarinet mouthpieces. I found this out when my fantastic Opperman piece slowly became quite average over the years   and then  the same thing happened to a great  Bay mouthpiece. Of course, coming from two masters I was reluctant to try to correct their work. It sure made a difference when I finally did. I once tried Larry Combs&#39; old Selmer mouthpiece that his Woodwind model was based on. It was totally dead sounding and I was told it was " blown out". This mouthpiece had been refaced several times so perhaps there really wasn&#39;t anything else that could be done to  revive it.
   Sax mouthpieces seem to be  more tolerant  of flat spots, perhaps because of the longer facing or the wider reed?   Anyone who has ever cleaned out the inside of a really scuzzy mouthpiece in hopes that it would play better without all the crud is usually disappointed that not much has  changed afterwards, so I don&#39;t think   a rough or smooth baffle makes a lot of difference.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi, Let me intrude on the conversation, but one thing is the intrinsic characteristics of the mouthpiece, reed, ligature that make the response, the tone and timbre of sound and other end is where going to stop this flow of sound.
If after the barrel enters a plastic clarinet will resonate in a way, if it has leather pads resonate in another.
Lately I&#39;m trying with some success a pad made ​​in situ on the basis of the pads that are installed, but without the skin or covering, which ultimately is in contact with the tone hole.
For the feature of this, say, controlled coating that allows the pad to take the shape of your accent until final curing, sealing is perfect and it is once finished if it was a complete resonator tone the inner side of hole .
This effect gives you a tone resonator, a ring and a response that does not depend on the mouthpiece, the baffle, rails or other features. I like to say that now these clarinets have a "taste" different in sound.
Logically all suffer wear clarinet, contractions, expansions of material and therefore, from time to time there to tweak some parts, from the nozzle to the end of the lower body. Especially in wood clarinets.
I hope I have collaborated with the interesting topic.

            <pre class='message__body'> A flat table that does not leak air is the first essential   of a good mouthpiece. I guess by eliminating the scratches  you managed to  fix the leak without  rounding  off  the table thereby  causing a new leak.
