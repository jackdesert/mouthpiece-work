Paul Coates has had success with a motorcycle face shield polish.  I use 
an automotive headlight lens restoration kit. Both of these are readily 
available @ most of the  large auto parts stores.  The minor amount of 
abrading that these do to the EXterior of the mouthpiece should not 
affect the sound.  Of course, with a C melody you might _want_ to affect 
the sound! :-)

            <pre class='message__body'>  That sounds like it could . I had a  kit used to take the scratches out of ski goggles  that was great for polishing and mild abrading. It must be the same kind of stuff that Paul uses.  I also have  some Meguiar&#39;s Scratch X  for cars. This seems to lay down a light film on the surface which might also work, though I prefer to  remove the film after applying in case the stuff is a skin irritant. To replace my used up ski goggle abrasive I have just bought some Hut Ultra Gloss meant for polishing plastics.it was recommended by a wood working specialty store. I don&#39;t  know yet whether this will be a worthy replacement. It does not have  a skin irritant  warning which is reassuring.            Peter</pre>

Hi. I am refurbing a c-melody sax which came with an original mp. It tastes
revolting. I have read that this is carcinogenic.
Has anybody tried polishing the outside with a mild abrasive (brass/silver

a hard rubber one then use cold water. If you put a hard rubber item in warm
water the rubber reacts with the chlorine molecules and causes a change of
surface colour. The revolting taste is probably sulphur, used in the
vulcanising purpose. It migrates to the surface of the piece and then
oxidises. If you use the steel wool method, when you&#39;ve removed the
discoloration give it a rub with beeswax to restore the colour.

As long as you wash it thoroughly to remove any traces of the polish it should be OK. I’ve also used fine steel wool on pieces as you describe with no ill effects.Tony F.From: MouthpieceWork@yahoogroups.com [mailto:MouthpieceWork@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of PeterL

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Nasty Mouthpiece    Hi. I am refurbing a c-melody sax which came with an original mp. It tastes revolting. I have read that this is carcinogenic.
Has anybody tried polishing the outside with a mild abrasive (brass/silver polish?) to remove a minute layer of the oxidised surface.
I have nothing to lose by trying but thought I would get your views first and then go and buy a new mp!

Yes, first scrub the mouthpiece under a stream of water with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.  This is a microcell sponge with some type of abrasive in it used for bathroom cleaning.  When finished you should have the brown, green, or orange oxidation removed, but the mouthpiece will still have a dull appearance.

Now hand polish with a good plastic polish such as Scratch Off (used for Plexiglas and other acrylic windshields and helmet face shields, headlight lenses, etc).  Some have had good success with Flitz Metal Polish.  Yes, polish by hand with a soft cloth, not a buffing wheel or Dremel tool.  Keep well away from powered tools!!!

It will not look new, but when the polishing is complete it will look far better than it did before.

            <pre class='message__body'>After you clean with a Magic Eraser under cold water, then polish with Scratch Out, Seal it with a Wax, just like a car&#39;s finish. Use Burt Bee&#39;s Wax or Walgreen&#39;s equivalent. Or use pure carnuba wax. Do this inside and out and it will stay fresher looking and crud comes off easier.

But after that, get a new C melody mouthpiece from Runyon, (Paul C is a dealer). You will be MUCH happier with tuning and using tenor reeds.
