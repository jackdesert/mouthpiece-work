            <pre class='message__body'>
I posted a pic of my first finished blank in the Photos CAD section.

I had no particular plan and just started carving away at the baffle 
with my flex shaft.  I ended up blending some ideas from Dukoffs, 
Lawtons and Guardalas.  It was still too bright for me so I angled 
the flat part of the baffle down ~.060".  I tried a couple of facings 
on it.  It has a .107" tip/50L facing that is biased elliptical.  I 
thinned the side rails and matched the outside shape of a tenor 
reed.  Tip rail is about .027" thick.  I opened the shank bore ~.015" 
to fit on my neck cork easier.  The chamber volume is still on the 
small side, but my 10M prefers this.  I curved the top beak edges 
some.  Did some sanding, steel wool, buffing wheel. Flitz polish and 
an Ultrasonic cleaning.

Plays nice with a 2.5 Fibracell.  A little gritty (from the reed)... 
Brecker-ish if you push it.

Next I plan to Nickle plate it (but I need to find some distilled 
water).  But this brass does not taste bad like some do.  

Because of the flat beak, the tip will be thin in the middle and the 
thicker at the two corners after you curve the tip to match the 
reed.  Just one of those geometry things.

Well my first electroless Nickle plating experiance went very well.  
Thanks to the advice here, I made sure the piece was ultra clean 
before plating.  I put on a middle-of-the-road .0005" layer that went 
on real even.  Took about 1 hr to heat up the bath and 30 min to 
plate.  

Took lots more minutes to read and decipher Caswell&#39;s intructions.  
They give a lot of good info, but you still need to fill in the 
gaps.  

I posted a pic in the Photos - CAD area.  I&#39;ll post some tips if 
anyone else gets into it using the Caswell kit.

I&#39;ve been lurking for a while and thought I would offer some help. I will
plate any mouthpiece for the group in silver or nickel or $10 plus shipping.
Gold would be $20. That&#39;s less than 1/2 of what I get outside the group.

            <pre class='message__body'>Chrome plating generally requires "triple plating".  First a flash of 
copper, then a nickle, the chrome.  But the finish is quite hard and if 
done correctly, durable.  Very hard to breack through this to reface, 
and difficult to touch up afterwards.

Silver, relatively easy, but constantly turns black.  Polishing will 
eventually remove it.  Easy to brush plate silver back on the facing 
after facing work.

Gold, must be plated first with silver.  Gold is soft, and wears quickly 
through to the silver.  Easy to brush plate silver, then gold after 
refacing work. 

Nickel... 95% as hard as chrome, and used in place of chrome in many 
industrial applications.  Not as bright as chrome.  Looks good after 
many years.  No experience replating after refacing.  I want to try the 
electroless nickel.  This seems the best overall, to me.

Some comments from Steve Fowler again?

            <pre class='message__body'>No. It&#39;s not a problem, but I think that it blisters easier. Just an
observation. We&#39;ve always used silver as an base plate under gold for brass
instrument mouthpieces and I have NEVER had a return for blistering. Every
commercial gold piece that I have seen with blisters and pits was plated
over nickel or stainless.
 
Also, if any of you start to get into any quantity, we can talk a little
break from there. I&#39;m going to be plating the mouthpieces for a new line of
trumpet and trombone mouthpieces, and can just slip them in with those.
 
NOTE TO ALL: At these prices I will be doing color buffing only. If you
want, I will do the buffing and polishing for an additional $10 per piece.

Hi, Keith.
 
I&#39;ve been lurking for a while and thought I would offer some help. I will
plate any mouthpiece for the group in silver or nickel or $10 plus shipping.
Gold would be $20. That&#39;s less than 1/2 of what I get outside the group.

Well my first electroless Nickle plating experiance went very well.  
Thanks to the advice here, I made sure the piece was ultra clean 
before plating.  I put on a middle-of-the-road .0005" layer that went 
on real even.  Took about 1 hr to heat up the bath and 30 min to 
plate.  

Took lots more minutes to read and decipher Caswell&#39;s intructions.  
They give a lot of good info, but you still need to fill in the 
gaps.  

I posted a pic in the Photos - CAD area.  I&#39;ll post some tips if 
anyone else gets into it using the Caswell kit.

            <pre class='message__body'>Overall, I agree with Paul. However, in my experience, gold only wears
quickly when there has not been enough put on in the first place! I have
never... okay maybe once, and I&#39;m not even sure about this, had a gold
mouthpiece back for a redo because it wore off. Heavy gold is a very stable,
durable surface. 
 
From an engineering standpoint, electroless nickel is softer and easier to
work, rework, than a piece plated in standard Watts-type plating bath. The
surface is softer. However, with electroless nickel, you plate as much on
the inside of the mouthpiece as you do anywhere else. With an electroplate
bath, that&#39;s not the case. You can setup the bath to plate heavier on the
top surface while avoiding changes to the lay. I can plate both so it&#39;s
entirely up to you guys.
 
Silver turns black only with some people. I personally have never had a
problem with it and yet the flute player that sat next to me at the Naval
Academy for 20 years could turn a flute black from across the room in 45
minutes! People that eat a lot of tomato based foods should avoid silver.
Seeing that Pizza uses tomato sauce... that includes most sax players!?!?

Chrome plating generally requires "triple plating".  First a flash of
copper, then a nickle, the chrome.  But the finish is quite hard and if done
correctly, durable.  Very hard to breack through this to reface, and
difficult to touch up afterwards.

Silver, relatively easy, but constantly turns black.  Polishing will
eventually remove it.  Easy to brush plate silver back on the facing after
facing work.

Gold, must be plated first with silver.  Gold is soft, and wears quickly
through to the silver.  Easy to brush plate silver, then gold after refacing
work.  

Nickel... 95% as hard as chrome, and used in place of chrome in many
industrial applications.  Not as bright as chrome.  Looks good after many
years.  No experience replating after refacing.  I want to try the
electroless nickel.  This seems the best overall, to me.

Some comments from Steve Fowler again?

Hi, Keith.
 
I&#39;ve been lurking for a while and thought I would offer some help. I will
plate any mouthpiece for the group in silver or nickel or $10 plus shipping.
Gold would be $20. That&#39;s less than 1/2 of what I get outside the group.
(Gold gets silver plated first.)
 
Current turnaround would be about a week.
 
Hope to help!
 
Steve

Well my first electroless Nickle plating experiance went very well.  
Thanks to the advice here, I made sure the piece was ultra clean 
before plating.  I put on a middle-of-the-road .0005" layer that went 
on real even.  Took about 1 hr to heat up the bath and 30 min to 
plate.  

Took lots more minutes to read and decipher Caswell&#39;s intructions.  
They give a lot of good info, but you still need to fill in the 
gaps.  

I posted a pic in the Photos - CAD area.  I&#39;ll post some tips if 
anyone else gets into it using the Caswell kit.
