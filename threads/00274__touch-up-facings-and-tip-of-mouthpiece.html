            <pre class='message__body'>What is the best procedure to do this without destroying the 
charistics of the mouthpiece?  Is this even possible?  I&#39;m talking 
minor scratches in the rails and a very small scratch in the tip.

Thanks, Don

            <pre class='message__body'>Depends on how deep and wide they are.  

Real minor: leave them alone.

Minor: could reface them off with 600 grit on a flat surface (glass plate).

A little worse: measure the facing first and be sure to get the same after
the reface.  Will probably need to recut the baffle too to compensate for
working on the rails.

More major: you get into filling the voids first with epoxy.
