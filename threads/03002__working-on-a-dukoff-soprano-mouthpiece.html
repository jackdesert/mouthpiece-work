Hi,

I&#39;m a sax player.  I need expert advice.  What is usually done to a 
Dukoff soprano piece, so that it plays better?

Plys "better" refers to better in tune, fatter high notes, rounder 
tone, less harshness, more "body", less chirps, etc.

Glen Johnston did some work to Kenny G&#39;s dukoff.  Anybody knows 
exactly what did he do?

Jon Van Wie mentioned to me once, before he passed away, that he 
had "seen" Glen&#39;s work on the G man&#39;s piece.

Any sort of opinions and advice would be greatly appreciated.

            <pre class='message__body'>Dukoffs come with chambers that are left as rough casted.  I finish all
these surfaces.  I usually remove the "wart" at the end of the wedge
baffle.  I blend the chamber into the sidewalls.  This gives some roundness
to the mid and low notes.

I file the baffle surfaces flat. I even up the thickness of the side rails
and thin them to open up the window if there is enough material to do this.
 This gives a full fat sound.

I relieve the baffle some near the tip rail.  This keeps the high notes
full sounding and minimizes the occurance of "chirps".

I flatten the table and put a responsive facing curve on the piece.  If
needed, I trim the sides and curve the tip to match the shape of the reed. 
This helps response and comfort while playing.
