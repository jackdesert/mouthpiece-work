            <pre class='message__body'>At long last, we are about to begin production!  It&#39;s a pretty radical
design: specific to the rock and roll market (think about it: on Saturday
night, more guys are playing "Mustang Sally" than are playing "Giant Steps".
BTW, they&#39;re generally getting paid a LOT better) and will be available in
tenor only. We did the design in Solid Works (after hand making a couple of
prototypes) and will begin manufacturing in the USA next week. The facings
will be hand finished, although the lathe cuts it amazingly close. It&#39;s
truly louder than anything I have ever played. We did extensive tests with
my Strobo-Tuner, and I think I&#39;ve got the intonation dialed in.
 
If any of you have any interest, I can send you a  link to the Solid Works
viewer (it&#39;s free) and a file that will show you what I&#39;m up to from every
possible angle. Your comments and suggestions would be much appreciated.
 
We suffered about $250,000 in damage to our building, and it will be months
before we are running up to speed. My house is uninhabitable. I DO have
internet service (powered by a generator, as we have no electricity and
won&#39;t for some time) and will be happy to share these files with any of you
who request them by emailing me at steveg@... . If Keith wants to
add them to the archives and can figure out how to do it and deems it
appropriate, maybe we can add them there.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks, Keith. The rail design solved several problems. In dealing with the
machinists, I&#39;ve learned a lot about manufacturing processes. It&#39;s not
simple!

I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t give a lot of credit to Ben Rosow. Ben is one
of my saxophone students, a mechanical engineer, and sells Solid Works for a
living. His input has been absolutely invaluable. He is totally familiar
with machining techniques (it&#39;s what he does all day every day) and is a
fine saxophonist himself. He and I will be working together on more projects
in the future. Ben took my design and turned it into something that could be
consistently duplicated. I don&#39;t have those skills, and this project would
not have been possible without Ben&#39;s tremendous contribution and constant
input. He was also part of the "panel" of saxophonists who helped me refine
the design through play testing. 

I hope Ben&#39;s schedule will allow him to join this group and contribute here.
He has some VERY unique expertise that would be of interest to anyone who
works with mouthpieces.
