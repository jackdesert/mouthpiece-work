            <pre class='message__body'>What is the effect of the clarinet mouthpiece bore taper on pitch and tuning relationships VS mouthpiece bore size. I know the depth affects overall tuning.

            <pre class='message__body'>Enlarging the bore will lower all the registers but will
lower the higher registers more than the lower. The
effects will be slightly different depending on which part
of the mpc bore is enlarged, but taper in and of itself is
not really a relevant factor AFAIK.

Do you know what the effects are for enlarging different parts of the
mouthpiece bore?

It is my understanding that the bore of the mouthpiece can have a significant effect on the tuning of altissimo notes since the relevant nodes/antinodes for these notes lie in the mouthpiece region.
The exact shape of the taper would tend to influence these notes in varying ways so a more parallel taper would tend to effect the highest range of altissimo more than a steeper taper.

When considering the much publicised/advertised effect of tapers in the barrel affecting the tuning of the twelths on R13s I can believe that a similar effect also occurs higher up the range

            <pre class='message__body'>I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t think they lie so far up the bore. It should be fairly easy to use chewing gum or some form of plasticine to alter the mpc throat profile and test empirically.
