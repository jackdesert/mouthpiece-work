            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,
I thought I would post this here before going the Ebay way...

I have 10 Tenor Runyon Custom blanks that I want to sell. I 
attempted to face 3 of them but they are still in tweakable 
condition. The rest I have just sanded off the table flash...

10 for $50 + shipping.

Please reply if interested to:
spr1ng64@...
