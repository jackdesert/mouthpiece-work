            <pre class='message__body'>What is the normal opening of a C Melody mouthpiece? 
This is the first C Melody I reface. It is a Conn sax with "alto shaped" neck. The mouthpiece is a Buescher with tip opening .056", the customer asked me to open it a little. Are 072 ok? And what facing length is normal for this mpc? It is 49 and 50, but isn&#39;t that a little too long?

            <pre class='message__body'>I have good results having them finished exactly like my favorite Tenor Sax facing AND adding a stick on baffle. Cheap reeds (use bass clarinet reeds if it is a short mouthpiece) is one benefit, and a much better playing mouthpiece is the other. The BEST answer though is to order a Runyon, Custom Spoiler mouthpiece for C melody saxophones. It makes them respond and sound like a modern horn (with two tone quality choices). With the new mouthpiece, Tu-ning is no longer a city in Asia. :-) A C* or D Selmer facing works much better than the little tip opening from the factory, but the whole mouthpiece from Runyon is a better set up.

            <pre class='message__body'>If it was mine C-Melody I had ordered a Runyon, but this is a customer that want things to be like they use to be in the old days. 
I flattened the table, made the facing length 45,5 and tip opening .072". He got it yesterday and called me today to tell that it was Perfect for him.  :-)

Why on earth would a person use a bass clarinet reed on a C-Melody?
I am tremendously happy with my Beechler C-Mel hard rubber mouthpiece.  I use tenor reeds.  Lets get real.... Rico alone makes over 30 reeds to color the sound on a tenor.  Don&#39;t like Rico -- then use Vandoren.  I use the same reeds (Rico Jazz Select 2M) on all my horns.  I wish there was one for my clarinet.  Regarding tip openings, why would a c-mel be any different than any other horn?  I know guys that play with an 80 opening, and reeds so stiff that I can&#39;t even get them to speak.  But--- the same is true in his choice of alto opening.
