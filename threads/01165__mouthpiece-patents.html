            <pre class='message__body'>I was wondering if there is anything preventing someone from making a
mold from an established make and changing things slightly (lay,
facing, baffle, rail width, etc...) then selling the piece. It seems
to me that many mps have been produced under this scenerio.
Also, can you patent lay measurements? If not, why aren&#39;t they posted
anywhere on the internet? Seems to me that if I find a lay measurement
that works well form me, I should be able to post it...
