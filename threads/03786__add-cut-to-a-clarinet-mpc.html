Hi Filippo,
           It sounds as if your player is not a classical type and is
using the wrong type of lay in the first place.
 The B45 has a fairly close tip of .046" and a long lay at .866". This
will encourage a smooth legato soft toned response in many styles of
playing. 
I would suggest a shorter lay will help with the attack and
brightness. If this is not possible then an acrylic wedge baffle
insert about 20mm long, to help compensate for the long lay, should
work wonders for both
power and brightness.   Eddie.
