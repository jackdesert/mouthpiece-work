            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all-

Would anyone care to recommend a file that is specifically designed for
stainless steel or works well for material removal?

This is what a google search yielded:

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>These look similar to Valtitan files, but I have not tried Corinox.  After, 2-3 SS mouthpieces a Valtitan file is too dull.  

I tried some inexpensive files sold by MicrMark as diamond impregnated.  They were way too coarse and left deep scratches.  

I rarely do major work on SS.  If I do I use grinding points in my rotary tool.

            <pre class='message__body'>I, too, have been using inexpensive diamond grit files that I can purchase
locally but they are small in the hand.  Was looking for something a little
larger that might be more aggressive...

Thanks again.

            <pre class='message__body'>304/304L stainless is only slightly harder than mild steel, so your normal HF cheapo file ($3.95 for 12) will cut it just fine for material removal.  The chromium content makes stainless gummy though, causing a lot more friction which will quickly dull any file if you rake it constantly on the back stroke.  Cutting strokes need to be definite, in one direction, light pressure, and not too fast.  If you get impatient you will ruin the tool on stainless steel.

One HF file will easily handle the pre-diamond/lapidary grit polishing, rough chamber shaping phase of 2-3 mouthpieces before I use it for a leather padded polishing handle, solder pick, or brazing flux applicator.  At that price, I just get a new one.

Diamond files cut a bit slower, but they handle even work hardened stainless.  As Kieth said, they leave scratches, so they are not for fine finishing.  Wet/dry sandpaper works great on flat surfaces but the edges cause more scratches than they remove on curved surfaces.  For fine shaping/polishing I use Fine lapidary grit on a leather pad glued to a dulled file, wet.

Coarse material removal I do with a 1/4" carbide ball cutter on a rotary tool - light cuts - 50% contact to keep the tool cool.  I don&#39;t use grinding stone tools as they cause too much heat which can ruin the stainless&#39; anti-corrosion properties (and see note below).  

Note - When cutting/filing stainless, one should use a P100 grade mask/respirator, as the microscopic hexavalent chromium particles released (looks like smoke when cutting on a mill or lathe or using grinding tools) are carcinogenic.

            <pre class='message__body'>I use sheets of sticky sandpaper on my files. I haven&#39;t found files that
are durable enough so the sand paper works fine for me.
