Yes. I am still taking orders at $29.00 shipped. Send the money via PayPal
using the following link:
 
https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=steve%40fowlermusic.com
&lt;https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=steve%40fowlermusic.com&no_shipping0&no_note=1&currency_code=USD> &no_shipping=0&no_note=1&currency_code=USD
 
Once the group is finished ordering, I&#39;m going to offer them to the general
woodwind market at $40.00 plus shipping. That&#39;s a more realistic price
considering the labor and packaging.

Steve,
 
Sorry I didn&#39;t get back to you sooner.  I see you&#39;ve already used the copy,
which is fine.  Good luck.  
 
Do you still have any of your tip gauges available from The Mouthpiece
Workgroup post?  If so, I&#39;d like one.  Is it $29?  Let me know what address
to send Paypal.
 
Phil

Congratulations on getting so much for your Brand Manual! I&#39;d like your
permission to copy from your listing to sell mine. Obviously you wrote a
winning copy!
 
Thanks.
