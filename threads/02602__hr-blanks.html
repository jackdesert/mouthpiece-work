Well after several attempts, Babbitt has dodged my request for HR 
Blanks yet again stating that they are backed up until February 
and "price increases" are in the future.
Every email I send them is met with a disdain for customers that is 
unacceptable in this business. If they had friendly people like 
Runyon, they would be a much better company.
I looked into Zinner but a single blank is $62.00 making R&D on their 
blanks cost-prohibitive.
Any other sources that I can tap for 100% HR?
Thanks in advance,
Patrick

            <pre class='message__body'>Try Bari Associates.  Find out where Kessler gets his blanks.

Hi Keith,
Kessler gets his from Babbitt...

> Try Bari Associates.  Find out where Kessler gets his blanks.
Will do - I have a hard time believing that there are only 2 
companies that do this... Zinner and Babbit...??? will find out tho.

Bari is a good option.  Many of you know however that
Bari was recently bought out by a violin STRING (!?)
company and Wolfe will stay on as a consultant. 
Anyway, I am interested in getting some soprano
blanks.  Maybe acting quickly will be a good idea.

Peace,

Bob

I would suggest looking in your local Mom & Pop music stores.  A lot 
of times, old mouthpieces that they&#39;ve been sitting on are made of 
the best Hard Rubber you can find.  The store is not doing anything 
but collecting dust with them, and is happy to sell them all at a 
reduced/bulk price...  Slightly used newer mouthpieces, or old 
stock Depending on your tools, and imagination - you can make great 
mouthpieces out of someone else&#39;s "garbage"
