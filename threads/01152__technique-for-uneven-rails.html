            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I&#39;m working on a Meyer Tenor piece with uneven rails. In fact, the 
uneven-ness extends all the way to the table. (This piece was 
terrible!)

I am amazed at the difference from just flattening the table and 
balancing the rails. The recent discussion about "flating" the table 
came in handy - I&#39;ve been holding the mouthpiece away from me, and 
drawing the piece towards me over 220, 360, 400 and 600 paper with 
excellent results!

As I was working on the rails - trying to even them up, I found that 
I was trying to apply slight pressure to the side that was higher - 
to remove material from this side - and trying NOT to remove much 
material from the other side.

Then it occured to me that - by doing so - I might be removing 
material as a slight angle by putting (slight) pressure on one side 
of the mouthpiece.

So I tried a different technique to prevent this: I started drawing 
the mouthpiece down the edge of the sandpaper, so that only one rail 
was on the sand paper. This way, I could keep the mouthpiece flat on 
my glass plate while drawing it towards me, but material is only 
removed from ONE of the rails.

Any thoughts? Any one else have any tips or techniques for balancing 
uneven rails?

Thanks, guys - this group is great! I, too, am having fun with this - 
it&#39;s addicting!! I find myself staying up late at night down in my 
basement measuring and tinkering with the proverbial "drawer full of 
mouthpieces" that every sax player seems to collect over the years.

Thanks,
Pete

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

Doesn&#39;t this create somekind of unevenness in the table? FWIW I have found
that by holding the mpc flat and putting more pressure on one side it very
definitely takes more material off the side with the pressure and the table
remains flat. Of course this does mean that material is still being taken
off the other side as well. Perhaps your method works well when one is
working with hard rubber (as opposed to metal) mpcs and doing finishing work
?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks, Paul,

You&#39;re right - I was concerned that putting pressure on one side of the mouthpiece would create a side-to-side angle. So, I used the edge of the paper. But, as you noted, that will also create a slight side-to-side angle, the other way.

Keith made the same suggestion - to put another piece of paper, grit side down,
next to the cutting paper. Then, as you said, the mouthpiece will be level.

And you&#39;re right, it&#39;s easy to look at the mouthpiece, turn it over and cut
the wrong side - I&#39;ve done it several times!! :-)

I have been using silicon carbide paper, as you suggested - but saying
"sandpaper" as a shorthand - fewer characters to type. (Tho, I guess we
could type "sc paper"...)

Thanks again for your excellent suggestions.

-Pete

            <pre class='message__body'>Correct, I was asking about working on uneven rails only.

THanks Paul & Keith.

This leads me to a closely related issue: balancing an uneven facing lenght.
IOW, balancing the rails RIGHT at the point where the facing curve begins
 - I found that it is a very delicate operation to remove material only from
one rail right at the beginning of the facing curve - without removing any
material from the table.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing: I lay 2 pieces of "sand"paper side by side,
(one wide grit up, the other grit down). I hold the mouthpiece on the paper
with the table flat on the paper, tip pointing away from me. 

Then I lightly draw the piece towards me and at the same time, start to lift
up the heel of the piece, attempting to remove only the slightest bit of
material
from the rail only (not the table) at the point that the facing curve
begins.

As I said, a very tricky, and delicate, operation.

Any one else have any suggestions, tips, tricks - for doing the above?

Thanks again,
Pete

This is the method I use for evening rails.  The table is not touched,
only the rails.

            <pre class='message__body'>For the .0015" reading (the facing length), I try to rough some of it in
early, but I save the final procedure to last.  It is too easy to mess it
up if you establish it first.

I&#39;ll usually uses 1000 and 1500 grit paper for this, as well as final rail
curve tweeking.  I like to sneak up on the goal numbers.  This is
ultimately faster than cutting on coarser grits, and then overshooting, and
having to recut the table and the rest of the facing.

I do the final adjustment for the .0015" numbers with the heel of the table
slightly off the paper before I stroke.  This creates a very slight kink
where the facing meets the table.  For final polishing, I turn some paper
over and stroke it a few times starting with the table flat on the paper
for part of the stroke, then I gradually tilt it to polish the entire
facing all the way to the tip.  The little kink at the table goes usually
goes away.  If not (like on hard metals), I use the 1000 and 1500 grit
paper for final polishing.
