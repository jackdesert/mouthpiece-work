            <pre class='message__body'>  Hello,
I play saxophone and flute in Rome.
I always have been very interested in how various components of mpc can affect the sound (it is usefull to know what kind of mp can help me to  express  the sound I "feel" in my head ); thus, I have collected  everything I have found about this argument: articles on Saxophone Journal (Ralph Morgan), interviews (Jon Van Wie), internet articles (Bob Ackermann, Paul Coats). Now, this group gives a large amount of information and I am very grateful to all (Paul Coats sent me a lot of  stuff, thanks).
I would start with just measuring and doing simple refacing work for the moment; I&#39;m collecting the tools on my own because I would not spend much money for a refacing kit now, when I am not sure if I am able to do some decent refacing work.
Now some questions:
In all sets of feeler gauges I found, the tinnest feeler is 0,05mm (about 0,002 inches); can it substitute the 0,0015 to determine where the curve of the lay starts?
 Wich is the best way to check if a table is warped? 
Does anyone knows  "Handbook Guide on Saxophone and Clarinet Mouthpices" by Claude Humber?
Thanks to all, ciao Filippo Bucci

You may use a .002" feeler as the smallest one.  If you have a facing
length specification for a .0015" feeler, like a 40 on the glass gage,
simply use 39 when using a .002" feeler.  It will be close enough based on
my spreadsheet analysis.

In the US I was able to find inexpensive feeler gages that start at .0015".
 But I did have to look at a lot of web sites.  I think they were only $6
US and were made in China.  Sometimes US shipping is very high on these
inexpensive sets in an effort to make more profit.  Just watch out for the
charges.  I have no idea what shipping to Italy would be.

            <pre class='message__body'>For many, many years, the standard feeler for measuring total facing
length has been the .0015" feeler.  However, these are very thin, and
easily creased, making them unusable.

Last year, in a discussion with John Winslow (Madison Enterprises), we
discussed this, and he suggested that .0020" feelers give very nearly
the same readings as .0015", and are less likely to crease.

He sent me one of these, and I must agree, I get very nearly the same
reading.  If the .002" (.05 mm) is more readily available to you, I see
no reason to not use it.

I also note that most of the other feelers in the Winslow kit are very
close to commonly available metric sizes, and those may be substituted
with no difference in measurement.
