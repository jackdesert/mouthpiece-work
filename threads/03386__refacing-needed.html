            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Dukoff Model 45 that it beat up a little that I would like to
have the table flattend, tip and rails worked, and facing curve
cleaned up on. BUT, I have to be able to have the piece back by June
2nd. I can send it out ASAP if someone calls me and tells me they can
do it. Please call me (913)406-6829 let me know if it something you
can handle. I live in Kansas so shipping isn&#39;t bad to anywhere.

Thank you,

            <pre class='message__body'>Your previous request was difficult.  This repeat is nearly 
impossible.  

I think you should get a backup mouthpiece that you would not mind 
playing on if your Duk 45 got damaged or lost.  Plus, there is a 
chance you will not like the reface work.  So a backup mouthpiece is 
important.  Plus it will allow you to get a good reface job without 
imposing time limits on the request.   

While I try to help out clients with reasonable time goals, I do not 
take on rush jobs.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree.....you should always have a backup piece if you primary needs work.  
I dont know of anyone reputable who would agree to this kind of rush, 
especially on a holiday weekend.

Just my opinion, no offense meant to anyone

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,
I have solved the rush problem... Now I just need to get this piece 
done. Can you send me your address or e-mail me with it and we can 
talk about what I am wanting done.

Thanks,
Herschel McWilliams
