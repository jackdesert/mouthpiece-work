In the files section , there is a clarinet facing curve that I have
found very useful, from post 2445. There are also a couple of earlier
posts on Tenor facings dated 12/31/02 and 1/25/03 for which I failed
to note the post numbers.
Do I adapt the clarinet facing curve for alto or stick to a sax curve?
If the latter, where do I find one?
 I have been using the Excel programme with some success for clarinet
facings but am uncertain about the changes needed for Alto
measurements as I am not mathematically inclined.

The spreadsheet curves that I have posted are all based on a radial 
curve facing.  As you mentioned, the Files section has a clarinet 
curve and a few tenor curves.  There are also a few soprano curves.  

All these curves use the same calculation.  They are adaptable by 
plugging in your particular set of feeler guages and adjusting the 
radius "R" and the curve/table tangent point "M".  The idea is to 
adjust R and M to get a curve that passes through your target facing 
length (.0015" feeler) and the tip opening.  Two variables to adjust 
to get two targets.

If you let me know what your alto targets are, I&#39;ll post an alto 
spreadsheet for you.
