            <pre class='message__body'>Just joined, and fear a long obsession with purchasing mouth piece 
after mouth piece. Anyway, my question is. " Is it really worth it?"
Does a $300 mouth piece really change your tone and range of 
register THAT much? We are all in persuit of perfection, but where 
do you draw the line. I mean, I have one of the nicest clarinets 
available, but I have been playing factory direct mouth pieces from 
day one. What am I getting into? Thanks for anyone&#39;s nutshell. RC
