            <pre class='message__body'>The title of this thread comes from a note found inside a saxophone sent
to our shop for repair.  The funny thing is that I understood exactly
what they were referring to.

The "warble" or "motorboating" on low B and C on saxophones is well
known by most players of the instrument.  Being curious  I began to
investigate some time ago what the "warble" actually is, what causes
some saxes/mouthpieces to do it and not others, and to look at solutions
to the problem.

I am working toward finishing a detailed web page that will show the
results of my investigation and the detail of the methods and equipment
involved, but I decided to put a recently completed video on this forum
showing the changes in the harmonics as the "warble" goes through each
cycle.

Without going into too much detail here a warble was recorded on a
C-melody saxophone playing low C and slowed down electronically.  Each
1/2 second slice of the slowed recording was analyzed on a spectrum
analyzer and an image saved of each graph.  Using windows movie maker, I
synchronized the sound file with the "snapshots" of the wave&#39;s
harmonics.

The uploaded file of the  wave harmonics

- how the 2nd and 4th harmonics are competing for dominance,
- how weak by comparison the fundamental is,
- the subtle shift to the right of all of the harmonics during the
"warble"

The actual pitch drop  of the tallest peak during the warble is
approximately 22 cents giving the impression of the pitch going flat as
it goes through the cycle.    More to follow.

ON my screen there is a light green column on the left that has the headings "Home", "Messages", etc. Clicking "Files" takes you to the page the files have been uploaded to. For some reason linking to those files does not work in the text of a post. 

Hope this helps. Maybe Keith can shed some light on this problem as well.

            <pre class='message__body'>Comments and questions...

The sound of this warble reminds me of harmonic "beating" where two wave forms alternately constructively and destructively interfere.  The video seems to support this.

Have you made any conclusions regarding the source of this instability?  Could the beat actually be a result of some heterodyne process from two higher harmonics, that interfere with the 2nd and 3rd harmonic?  

I am aware of the phenomenon on both alto and tenor, having at various times experienced this warble sound.  Although in my experience, the sound FEELS more like an oscillating obstruction, as if there was a small pump pushing air back into my mouth.  And my memory of the sound (my current setups don&#39;t do this) is that it is more like a diaphragm vibrato (volume vibrato); your file sounds more like a lip, that is, a pitch vibrato.  Bad either way, and could stem from the same source.

            <pre class='message__body'>Very interesting, but I&#39;d like to clarify that Rocaboy is mistaken 
regarding the duration of reed positions coupled to cylindrical air 
columns.  The reed is not open the same amount of time that it is 
closed.  True, both phases last for the length of time it takes sound to
 travel 2 lengths of the tube, but since the volume of the closed reed 
mouthpiece is less than the open reed mouthpiece, the equivalent length 
of the tube is less, so the duration is less.  From the standpoint of 
asymmetrical phases, the ratio is 50/50, but in the time domain, the 
ratio is ca. 72/28, as per my recent cylindrical waveform analysis.  
This ratio will vary according to the strength of the reed (a weak reed 
will have a longer reed open phase, compared to a stiff reed)  the tip 
opening of the mouthpiece (an open.longer facing results in a longer 
reed open
 phase than a close facing - other factors being equal), and dynamic 
considerations.  

So to describe the tube length/reed cycles for 
our purposes, simply via mathematics (I like X, Y, Z, but any variable 
will do)

Cylindrical Air Column:

X = 1 tube length open 
reed volume
Y = 1 tube length closed reed volume
Z = 1 complete 
wave-form cycle

2X + 2Y = Z
X > Y in duration due to 
mouthpiece volume

Conical Air Column

X = 1 tube length 
open reed volume
Y = 1 tube length reed closed volume
t = distance
 of truncation to apex, reed closed volume, by s.o.s./closed reed equiv.
 tube length
Z = complete wave-form cycle

2X + 2Y*t = Z

t
 is constant

Does that look good to you guys?

Conical Air Column

X = 1 tube length 
open reed volume
Y = 1 tube length reed closed volume
t = distance

Distance from truncation to apex (closed reed) is constant.

      Very interesting, but I&#39;d like to clarify that Rocaboy is mistaken 
regarding the duration of reed positions coupled to cylindrical air 
columns.  The reed is not open the same amount of time that it is 
closed.  True, both phases last for the length of time it takes sound to
 travel 2 lengths of the tube, but since the volume of the closed reed 
mouthpiece is less than the open reed mouthpiece, the equivalent length 
of the tube is less, so the duration is less.  From the standpoint of 
asymmetrical phases, the ratio is 50/50, but in the time domain, the 
ratio is ca. 72/28, as per my recent cylindrical waveform analysis.  
This ratio will vary according to the strength of the reed (a weak reed 
will have a longer reed open phase, compared to a stiff reed)  the tip 
opening of the mouthpiece (an open.longer facing results in a longer 
reed open
 phase than a close facing - other factors being equal), and dynamic 
considerations.  

So to describe the tube length/reed cycles for 
our purposes, simply via mathematics (I like X, Y, Z, but any variable 
will do)

Cylindrical Air Column:

X = 1 tube length open 
reed volume
Y = 1 tube length closed reed volume
Z = 1 complete 
wave-form cycle

2X + 2Y = Z
X > Y in duration due to 
mouthpiece volume

Conical Air Column

X = 1 tube length 
open reed volume
Y = 1 tube length reed closed volume
t = distance
 of truncation to apex, reed closed volume, by s.o.s./closed reed equiv.
 tube length
Z = complete wave-form cycle

2X + 2Y*t = Z

t
 is constant

Does that look good to you guys?
