I thank Paul Coats for his explanation  and  Mojo- if I may use the nickname- for  direcing 
me towards  the educational material in the files and also on his website. 

So refacing is about removing impetiments to the mouth pieces full potential. The 
question is  do some pieces have a big potential  to be discovered or is refacing basically 
about small improvements and that&#39;s about it?  

Does the term refacing cover the whole of mouthpiece work?

Two  mouthpieces with which I am familiar are the Yamaha 4c and the Berg Larsen metal 
130 2 m

What kind of thing would you do to make these mouth pieces more jazz player friendly?

The Berg Larsen metal 130 2 m is of course already a jazz mouth piece.

I ask the question because being familiar with the sound of these mouth pieces I can 
better understand your answer.

I get the general  idea that mass produced mouthpieces are not entirely finished and the  
mouth piece technician in adding the final touches has the change to customize the mouth 
piece.

Does the Berg Larsen count as a mass produced or as a hand finished mouth piece? And if 
it is the latter, is there still room for further work on the part of the technician?

In general is it possibly to make the sound of stock stock mouthpieces substancially more 
Jazz player friendly?

In any case, stock mouthpieces-being cheap and plentiful-  must constitute excellent 
practice material!

Hi Tom, I endorse the last statement. Buying cheap mouthpieces on Ebay
is a good way to learn & practice refacing skills.
The 4C is easy to work on, but the Larsen if steel, is very difficult
to alter without specialised tools.
I find, the poorer a mouthpiece is to start with, greater are the
improvements that can be made. There is no guarantee that it will
finish up to your liking, but you get a lot of satisfaction from your
efforts when it does. Your other questions would be better answed by
more experienced members.  Eddie
