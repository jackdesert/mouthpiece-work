John is either quite ill or deceased.  The company was John and his sons.  I don&#39;t
know that they have made anything at all for several years.   Sad, Winslow had some
good products.  Paul

Where is John Winslow hiding? 
Try (608) 241-1124 in Madison WI. They seems to want to hide from the web.

So if they ask, this number came right off the instructions they sent out

with their ligatures (mine are years old).
