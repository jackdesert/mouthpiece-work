            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve put the stainless steel piece to bed now. I&#39;m very happy with 
it, it really flies up the top, plays with a gutsy timbre (brassy

I&#39;m trying to make the aluminium version darker without losing the 
superb altissimo performance. I started by copying over the mods done 
on the SS blank, and found that it played very similar, but with 
slightly less edge (I guess as you&#39;d expect).

I did not want to make the same mistake as on the first plastic blank 
(where I dressed the baffle out and lost altissimo performance), so I 
left the baffle more or less alone. I opened out the chamber to be

retain its high altitude performance, but the piece is very difficult 
low down now. Low D warbles and tries to leap octaves, and lower 
notes are hard to get.

For the time being, I&#39;ve taken a step back and rebuilt the chamber 
with aluminum epoxy in order to try again. Anyone got any clues what 
to do next? Did I just take the chamber out too big?

            <pre class='message__body'>So John, what is the shape of the break from the baffle to the chamber now? If you have a sharp edge you might want to round that down. You want a relatively smooth transition from baffle to chamber IMO, expecially if the baffle is very high and the chamber large. You could create some turbulence problems there otherwise, I think.

I have been experimenting with the idea of hollowing out the baffle--starting down about a half cm from the tip and creating a channel that eventually widens out in a kind of exponential shape as it moves down to join the chamber. Unfortunately I did this only on one mpc and so no longer have a "control" to measure it against. My feeling is that it "rounded" out the sound (this was to a Berg Larsen metal tenor piece)--a bit less edgy but still plenty bright with the characteristic Berg Larsen projection. I like the result mucho. No guarantees but you might want to give something like this a try.

The low note warbles are usually due to a leak.  Perhaps you are able 
to blow through the leak with certain mouthpiece/reed set-ups.

I find that on soprano, more than the bigger saxes, the chamber size 
is critical to getting the sax to play in tune with itself.  One 
chamber size will not work for all sopranos and all players.  But it 
is good to have a chamber size that is near the missing volume of the 
sax body cone after the mouthpiece is tuned on the cork.

If the chamber is much larger than the needed volume, it will force 
you to jam it on the neck to tune the mid range of the sax.  High 
notes will be sharp in relation to the low notes.  The opposite 
happens if the chamber is too small.

Many well known mouthpiece experts state that making a chamber 
smaller makes the high notes go sharp.  This is only true if you do 
not retune the sax by pulling the mouthpiece out some.  Once you 
retune the sax to recover the needed chamber volume to play most of 
the notes in tune, the high notes will be flat.  

Anyone can test this for themselves by putting some temporary putty 
in their favorite mouthpiece to make the chamber smaller.  You need 
to use a chromatic tuner and you need to have a steady embouchure to 
see the results.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks (Mojo, Toby, et al). I&#39;ll put the leak light on it to check. 
Low notes sound beautifully on the SS mpc though. The main difference 
is that I have increased the chamber volume on the aluminium piece 
using a 3/8" sanding drum on the Dremel. The chamber is consequently 
very similar to the Runyon Jaguar, but it runs out into the baffle 
ramp. I have started to compromise the intonation now as well, so 
think the chamber is just too big. I&#39;ll have another tweak when the 
epoxy is dry.

Might try working the baffle out from the tip end this time.....

Low note warbles are also what happens when you hog the chamber out too
large.  Test it this way... tune the horn to your tuning note... is it
warbling on the low end?  Pull the piece, put in some putty, whatever
you use, reduce the chamber volume, replace it and tune again (it will
tune to a different position due to the volume change).  Now does it
warble?  If the warble went away, it was not due to a leak.

Absolutely... what it really affects is intonation in the palm keys.

I have seen this effect on soprano, AND bass sax... but with soprano it
come in with a vengence.

Even bass, the old saw, " you need a big, round chamber dill pickle mpce
to play a bass" is BS.  A big chamber bass piece makes our Buescher go a
half step sharp in the palm keys.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi John,

There are a couple of things you might try to darken the piece a bit, but I am really not sure how they would affect your top end. First would be to cut your baffle down just behind the tip rail. It&#39;s not an easy task, especially with a metal piece. You need a steady hand with a Dremel (actually I recommend a Dremel stand). If you manage this successfully I think you will find that it will smooth the sound quite a bit by reducing the ratio of top partials to the lower ones. The piece will project but it won&#39;t be as bright (some might say thin). The other, easier option is to take the back of the baffle down. That, I think, will give the sound more body, but you will still have the edge.

For me it&#39;s very hard to judge just how far to go with these things, and especially hard if I don&#39;t have something to compare it to for reference. Of course if you&#39;ve already built the baffle up with epoxy you can always do it again...

            <pre class='message__body'>I have not had much luck with sop altissimo (nor have I really tried much), but I have no trouble getting up there on tenor with an old M.C. Gregory mpc with no baffle and a reasonably large chamber, nor a modern Yani 7. The altissimos are after all no higher than the third or fourth partial, and the higher partials that we are talking about  when we speak of "edge" on a high baffle piece extend up to the 7th partial and beyond. So I&#39;m not convinced that the different partial characteristics of different mpcs is the main factor in altissimo response. Still it may be true that the increased loading on the reed with a high baffle piece may somehow facilitate altissimos, especially with a sop. Just a thought.

            <pre class='message__body'>A minor point, referencing Ernest Ferron&#39;s "The Saxophone Is My Voice", page
31:

 "Remember that, harmonics are the sound components whose frequencies are
always whole multiples of the fundamental&#39;s frequency and partials are sound
components outside that series."

By this definition, isn&#39;t the altissimo register actually composed of the
upper "harmonics", as opposed to "partials"?

I bring this up because the mouthpieces that I have played that made
altissimo  the easiest for me have all been dark-playing mouthpieces.  I had
an old MC Gregory tenor 5A-20 that was refaced by Jey Clark to a .100" tip
opening.  That mouthpiece would play G3-C4 very easily, and gave the
"purest" fundamental sound throughout the normal range of the horn of any
mouthpiece I&#39;ve ever played.  I have also had better success with a rubber
Link 7* than with other higher-baffle mouthpieces.

It could be that, as a long-time Link 7* player, I&#39;m simply more accustomed
to the larger-chambered mouthpieces.  Then again, Mojo (and Doc Tenney) have
posted out at SOTW that tweaking the tip rail is the best way to coax the
altissimo out of a mouthpiece.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for your input Mike. However, when you mention altissimo 
working for you on "dark" pieces, is this in relation to soprano&#39;s?

I can play altissimo on alto with any of my 6 (or 7?) mouthpieces 
with no problem at least up to D. When pushing the limits to find 
just where i could get to, I found that a Lawton 5*BB in stainless 
steel really whistled up till the dogs got upset (Didn&#39;t like it 
overall though, and traded it for an 8*BB).

Soprano&#39;s are much more difficult to excite harmonics on, because of 
the short tube length. I have been unable to play altissimo on sop 
without a high-baffled mouthpiece, and hence my new design (which I 
am ecstatic about, and getting ready for a first run of 10 off).

If you are referring to soprano&#39;s, which mouthpiece(s) in particular?

Thanks,
John

Try a slightly more open mpc and see wether this actually solves this
altissimo problem. Actually the altissimo on a Soprano is pretty
ridiculously high anyway and has limited application other than terrorising
lead trumpeters or piccolo players.

No, I was referring to tenor altissimo.  Sorry if that was off-topic.

            <pre class='message__body'>So true, Bootman, but I do find the altissimo F#&#39;s, G&#39;s, G# and A very
useful.  Just adding those few notes to the "normal" range is a big
help.

We regularly perform Paul Cohen&#39;s arr of Shepard&#39;s Hey (Percy Grainger),
which has high G&#39;s and A&#39;s in several places.

With the benefit of hindsight, if I went to buy a sop piece now I&#39;d 
go for the shortest lay, quite open with reasonably high baffle. The 
Vandoren S35 has a long lay which may be what makes altissimo 
difficult.

            <pre class='message__body'>The most valuable altissimo notes are F#3, G3, G#3, A3, and up to C4.
But if we can get the F#-A, we have added an important extension to our
range.

A partial refers to a harmonic overtone. An easily understood corollary 
would be the harmonic overtone series on a bugle played by lip and air 
pressure manipulation.  The saxophone is capable of playing the 
harmonic overtone series also from a held low tone by manipulation of 
the embouchure and larnyx.  For instance low Bb would be the 
fundamental tone. Then the next partial in the harmonic overtone series 
would be middle line treble clef Bb followed by top line F, then Bb 
above one ledger line, then D above 2 ledger lines, then F above three, 
Ab above four, etc.  Playing these partials from the fundamental tone 
on the saxophone is a good control exercise for the altissimo register.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thank you, Paul.  Thank you, Greg.  I understand the concept of fundamental and harmonics.  I just have never heard of them referred to as "partials".  Where does the term come from; the fact that the wavelength of the harmonic  frequency is a "partial" of the fundamental?

Thank you,

David

A partial refers to a harmonic overtone. An easily understood corollary 
would be the harmonic overtone series on a bugle played by lip and air 
pressure manipulation. The saxophone is capable of playing the 
harmonic overtone series also from a held low tone by manipulation of 
the embouchure and larnyx. For instance low Bb would be the 
fundamental tone. Then the next partial in the harmonic overtone series 
would be middle line treble clef Bb followed by top line F, then Bb 
above one ledger line, then D above 2 ledger lines, then F above three, 
Ab above four, etc. Playing these partials from the fundamental tone 
on the saxophone is a good control exercise for the altissimo register.
