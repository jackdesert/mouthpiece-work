  Hi Paul,

  The Comet bari sax mpc is stupendous!  I thought for a moment, just a moment now, that I almost sounded like Serge Chaloff.  I was able to pussyfoot around the low A and Bb so softly and easily, and then up to the altissimo with hardly any effort  Thank you so much for fixing it like that.  The other Runyon bari was much better also, but much darker.  You got the openings on both just where I like it.

  I&#39;ve yet to try the Runyon soprano....but will do it soon.

  And once again,

  Thank you,

  Fred</pre>
