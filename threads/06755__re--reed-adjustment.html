You can Google "Reed Adjustment" and get lots of hits.  I used to do a lot in my youth using the info in Larry Teel&#39;s "The Art of Saxophione Playing".  This chart is similar:

http://www.saxgourmet.com/reedadj.html

Nowadays (for sax) I just buy a bunch of Fibracells and micro grade them in strength.  If the facing curve has a good shape, I do not find reed adjustment neccessary to get the response I&#39;m looking for.  

Reed adjustment does work.  But it is tedious and with cane is only temporary.

I use Legere&#39;s on clarinet.  For a doubler, they are superb.

            <pre class='message__body'>Tom,

    I have a question for you regarding the fibracells (and anyone else who wants to answer). I&#39;ve had a couple of fibracells for a while now, and I play them for a bit, but always find myself going back to cane. It has nothing to do with the sound at all - I have a bright sound anyway, and I really like the little bit extra that I get with a fibracell. The issue is that I find the altissimo response, and occasionally the higher (palm key) response to not be the same as cane, and much more difficult to play. Have any of you seen this, and if so, what have you done to get fibracells to respond better when trying to play altissimo ? If I can make that work, I may never play a cane reed again...  I find cane continues to get less and less consistent, and they just play like crap anymore... Thanks,

    Jerry

Jerry, actually I find Fibracells better and more consistent for altissimo than cane.  I can&#39;t get good altissimo response from Legere reeds however.

cane reeds you&#39;ve been using; have you tried a step down in softness?  eg.
if you&#39;re using a 3, try a 2-1/2.

I use them, and I do find they are considerably brighter than cane, and
mostly with good altissimo response.  That said, I used to be able to use
them without any adjustment, but they changed things a bit a few years ago,
and now they are rarely "just right" out of the box.  Or maybe I&#39;ve just
gotten fussier.

http://www.ridenourclarinetproducts.com/adjusting.htm

Of course, Tom has left out the actual details of his particular system for
actually adjusting the reed, which, suffice to say, is a bit different than
using a reed knife, and IMO extremely effective.

It pays for itself. I had a bunch of Fibracells accumulated over the years
that were mediocre players, but that I&#39;d always hoped to figure out how to
adjust successfully.  Most of them I&#39;ve been able to turn into good players
with Tom&#39;s method. Many of them into extremely good players.

If I had students, demonstrating Tom&#39;s reed-finishing method would be part
of the curriculum, for sure.

Tom,
 
    I have a question for you regarding the fibracells (and anyone else who wants to answer). I&#39;ve had a couple of fibracells for a while now, and I play them for a bit, but always find myself going back to cane. It has nothing to do with the sound at all - I have a bright sound anyway, and I really like the little bit extra that I get with a fibracell. The issue is that I find the altissimo response, and occasionally the higher (palm key) response to not be the same as cane, and much more difficult to play. Have any of you seen this, and if so, what have you done to get fibracells to respond better when trying to play altissimo ? If I can make that work, I may never play a cane reed again...  I find cane continues to get less and less consistent, and they just play like crap anymore... Thanks,
 
    Jerry

I agree on the Fibracells. That&#39;s all I use on bass clarinet & all my saxes.

However, I have a couple that seem to be balanced, play easily through all of the registers.  That being said, they sque-e-e-ek!  Other reed on the same mouthpiece do not.  Does anyone have any ideas on why & what may cure the problem?

I second the opinion on Ridenour&#39;s method.  I have been an inveterate "reed-fiddler" for (OMG!) 50 years now.  Was taught at an early age to use dutch rush.  I had good results (about 1/2-2/3 the reeds in a box were usable on gigs), but after learning the Ridenour method I am now surprised when I *CAN&#39;T* make a reed play well.

I found that to be the case, too, until I changed to the Fibracell Premiums. The strength grading seems to be more carefully done, and  closer to the actual half-strengths we&#39;re used to with cane.

You can Google "Reed Adjustment" and get lots of hits. I used to do a lot in
my youth using the info in Larry Teel&#39;s "The Art of Saxophione Playing".
This chart is similar:

http://www.saxgourmet.com/reedadj.html

Nowadays (for sax) I just buy a bunch of Fibracells and micro grade them in
strength. If the facing curve has a good shape, I do not find reed
adjustment neccessary to get the response I&#39;m looking for. 

Reed adjustment does work. But it is tedious and with cane is only
temporary.

I use Legere&#39;s on clarinet. For a doubler, they are superb.

I&#39;ve had a couple of fibracells for a while now, and I play them for a bit, but always find myself going back to cane. It has nothing to do with the sound at all - I have a bright sound anyway, and I really like the little bit extra that I get with a fibracell. The issue is that I find the altissimo response, and occasionally the higher (palm key) response to not be the same as cane, and much more difficult to play. Have any of you seen this, and if so, what have you done to get fibracells to respond better when trying to play altissimo ? If I can make that work, I may never play a cane reed again...  I find cane continues to get less and less consistent, and they just play like crap anymore... Thanks,

Jerry,

My experience with Fibracells is the same as yours: excellent response, except in the upper range. I might attribute this to their tendency to soften up during a playing session, but I don&#39;t ever have the same altissimo response on Fibracells that I have on cane. 

I think there might be another issue though with Fibracells. Players I know who have listened to me play both cane and F-cells comment that the F-cell sound doesn&#39;t have as much "core" to it as a cane reed. Anyone else here have a comment on this?

I also second Keith&#39;s statement on Legeres, this time for soprano. My sound using Legeres on soprano may not be noticeably different than when using cane. This is not at all the case on alto and tenor (terrible buzzy sound).

All the best, Jeff

My experience is a little different.  

First, I&#39;ve used Fibracells since they were first introduced.  I was told by others my tone was indistinguishable from the cane reeds I had been using.

I found that altissimo was easier and more predictable from day to day, and reed to reed.  The reeds were consistent from sample to sample, and did not change daily as they aged.

Now the problem... they have changed the materials used.  I don&#39;t know exactly what the changes are, but the Fibracells made in the last 6 months are not playing well for me.  I&#39;ve heard complaints from others about how they are not playing well now.  I talked to Dave Shaeffer and he is aware of the problem and is working on it.

I hope this is resolved soon as I really liked the original Fibracells.

full and bright, but I have not found another like it.  I think they are
rough on the lower lip as well.  I&#39;d also like to add, that if you practice
consistently, even if only one hour/day, you can make almost any reed work
though the sound may not always be killer.  For sure, it will be acceptable
in most playing situations.  Then again, I&#39;m just a working harlot, so my
opinion may be of little value.  john

            <pre class='message__body'>Agreed: the newer Fibracells don&#39;t play as well as older ones. I think it&#39;s
longer than 6 months that they have not played as well.

 "If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it!"

My best playing Fibracells are ones from several years ago (as noted
previously, they seem to recover after a lengthy "rest".) They are so much
more lively than the new ones.

On tenor, the Hahn synthetic reed is OK. Maybe better than the new
Fibracells, not as good as the older ones. Expensive. (I&#39;ve bought one so
far, so that&#39;s a small sample) I think they run a tad softer than Fibracell
as far as the numbers.

            <pre class='message__body'>I have two problems with Fibracell reeds:
 
1.  They play flat for me when they get higher (clarinet altissimo) and
 
2.  Anything larger than an alto reed sounds to me like a sheet of plastic flapping in the breeze.
 
The flatness issue does NOT affect Legeres, oddly enough.  I have not tried Legeres for tenor, but all Fibracells and Baris have so far failed me.

If you have to mic a saxophone, the rest of the band is TOO LOUD!

My experience is a little different.  

First, I&#39;ve used Fibracells since they were first introduced.  I was told
by others my tone was indistinguishable from the cane reeds I had been using.

I found that altissimo was easier and more predictable from day to day, and
reed to reed.  The reeds were consistent from sample to sample, and did not
change daily as they aged.

Now the problem... they have changed the materials used.  I don&#39;t know
exactly what the changes are, but the Fibracells made in the last 6 months are
not playing well for me.  I&#39;ve heard complaints from others about how they
are not playing well now.  I talked to Dave Shaeffer and he is aware of the
problem and is working on it.

I hope this is resolved soon as I really liked the original Fibracells.
