I have a HR soprano mouthpiece which is 14.1 mm in bore diameter. Any

            <pre class='message__body'>I coat the inside of the bore with epoxy then I sand it as needed to get to
size.  I use 5-minute clear epoxy but I still wait 24 hours for it to get
hard enough to sand.  A high speed rotary tool with a sanding drum saves
time on sanding.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Sergei,

One way might be to insert and epoxy in a sleeve--if you can find something suitable. Another possibility would be to line the inside with epoxy putty or successive layers of JB Weld or some other hard-setting epoxy, then ream it out to the correct diameter. With epoxy putty--which holds its shape before it is set you could use a dowel or rod of the correct diameter (or close) to shape it before it is set.

If you have to sand it out by hand instead of using a reamer, you can check the inside eccentricity by making pencil marks inside. After you have a series of pencil lines drawn around the entire inside of the bore, push the mpc down on a rod or dowel of the correct diameter and then take it off again and see where the pencil lines have been blurred by contact with the rod (you can make a rod of the correct diameter by finding something close, then wrapping with thick tape until the correct 13.5 mm diameter is reached--this will simulate the corked neck).

Where the pencil lines have been rubbed off or blurred are your high spots, and where they remain clear are your low spots. File or sand out the high spots carefully and retest in the same way until you have gotten close. One good way of doing this is to wrap a dowel slightly smaller than the inside bore (say 12 or 13 mm) with sandpaper held on by double sided tape. Since the two diameters are close you don&#39;t risk creating low spots as you might using a small diameter file. 

This is how we make the bamboo tenon joints of shakuhachi flutes round. It takes some time but you can do quite well. Don&#39;t forget that a bit of eccentricity or unevenness will be buffered by the compressibility of the cork, so it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect.

Hope you could understand that.

Toby
