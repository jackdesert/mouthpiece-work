           I would be lost without the masking tape. However I am the odd one out who starts refacing from the table side and
           not from the tip like anyone else. Must be due to the fact that I started refacing that way. The masking tape allow one to 
           sense (see and feel) when you start touching a area.  I think the masking is especially usefull when aproaching the table
            end of the rails. It stops one from making the facing to long.

I just found a little trick to isolate an area for sanding...
I was working on an alto piece and had the lowest part of the lay cut
nicely at 40. I didn&#39;t want to touch this part but wanted to hone the
next area from 34 to 35. I marked 40 on the mpc with pencil on both
sides, then put a piece of masking tape accross the lay at around 41.
I sanded from the back as I would if I were lengthening the lay using
gentle force and after several times of taking the tape off and
measuring, I got it without disturbing the 40.
Whew!

            <pre class='message__body'>Alf,

You&#39;re not the only one who starts at the table. The first thing
I do is flatten the table. This, of course, changes the facing length.
So, the next obvious thing to do is work on that (obvious to me,
at least..)

Patrick, Thanks for the "tip" regarding the masking tape. Will
make my life easier! :-)
