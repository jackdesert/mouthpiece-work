I never made a chamber like this myself but I have played a Fatboy Guardala with ridge next to a regular Guardala.  I did not notice a difference.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yeah.   Although, If the walls vibrate enough, they don&#39;t have to couple to change the effective cross sectional area of the tube (Benade/Nederveen) which would change the sound, but, that&#39;s all academic.  Steve is talking about mouthpiece chambers being oval, where there is a good deal of compliance - the mouthpiece bore is fatter than the conical extension of the neck.  There, stuffing the compliance in the corners of a square or in the far ends of an ellipse, instead of it being equally distributed around the bore axis, will just make the chamber behave narrower than it actually is.

Theoretically, if the cross-sectional area across the neck is the same 
as in a round neck, it should sound the same. Of course, the more 
elliptical, the more area for wall losses. Also, this brings down the 
resonance frequencies of the walls, and if thin enough, they could 
couple with a playing frequency and vibrate, which might well change the 
sound somewhat. But for moderate ellipticity, I doubt those effects
