            <pre class='message__body'>I have always like the "earthy" feel of wood mouthpieces when playing them.  Dark and warm feeling even if they have a high baffle.  Probably has to do with a different vibration transmission to the player&#39;s skull.
 
I have reface a bunch of wood Lebayles.  Probably because they are lower cost but I have not compared prices.  Half of them held a facing nice and half of them were unstable.  I would face them and check them again after 30 minutes and they would already be crooked.  Like facing a moving target.  
 
I have only done a couple of wood Branchers but they were stable.  Hard to conclude much with only a couple, but I liked them.  
 
I think stabilized wood is the way to go.  The plastic pressure forced into the pores of the wood grain stabilize the dimensions and I think they look cool too.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve had to repair cracks in several wood mouthpieces.  Mostly due to rapid
humidity changes from air travel.  I also live in NY and the humidity varies
greatly between winter and summer so wood pieces do need care.  I suspect if
you live in an area where the humidity level is constant, warping and cracks
would be less of an issue.

All of the wood piece I&#39;ve had experience with have been either rosewood or
ebony which are very hard woods relative to almost all other varieties so
I&#39;m not sure what you mean by excessive softness.

They are also naturally oily woods, but I will treat with mineral oil which
will not turn rancid.  I flood the surface until it appears the wood is
saturated and will not absorb any more of the oil and then wipe up excess
surface oil with a cotton cloth.  The piece can be used after 24hrs.

The ebony Brancher pieces appeared to me to be of much higher quality than
the Lebayle pieces.  I&#39;ve not seen anyone playing on Wanne&#39;s resin/wood
pieces so I can&#39;t comment.  Personally I&#39;m not a huge fan of wood
mouthpieces but I had the great honor of working on one of the first
rosewood pieces Francois Louis made for Billy Mitchell in the early 1980&#39;s
and it was one of the most incredible sounding pieces I&#39;ve ever heard.

matt

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m just curious.

At the end of a reface, I lightly wet the table and rails and put the mpc in contact with a piece of flat glass from the bottom. The water contacts the glass and makes it very clear which rail is higher. I then roll the mpc from table to tip and watch the water. This is especially valuable just at the transition from side rails to tip rail--it is easy to see if the rail are even.

Of course care must be taken that the water (or oil) is evenly distributed on the rails, but one gets a continuous visual idea of the evenness of the rails.

Anybody else tried this?

            <pre class='message__body'>I just tried this on a Graftonite piece I&#39;d been working on.  What I found
was that slight variations in the water film thickness changed the reading.
At first blush, there was a very obvious rail assymetry. Adding a little
water changed the side that looked high. Adding a little bit of soap to kill
surface tension and help spread the water film changed it again - now the
mouthpiece rails look even, which I think is correct

At the least this could be useful for a fast diagnostic eyeballing.  I don&#39;t
know that I&#39;d trust it at the end of a reface.
However, the glass slab I used has some surface abrasion, this would
probably work better with a virgin slab.
