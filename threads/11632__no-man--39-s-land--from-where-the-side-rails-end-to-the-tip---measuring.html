People say it helps altissimo if it is curved but also increases resistance
in my experience. The fellers and the tip:  I see no problem if it doesn&#39;t
go deep. The latest feller that does shows you the tendency and the tip
itself you can see it on light, again being flat helps.

            <pre class='message__body'>When the facings are cut on the Runyon facing machine, the curve maintains the same radius all the way from the "break" to the tip.  And these mouthpieces play just fine.

But that is easy to do with the machine.  When hand refacing it is very difficult.  As the mouthpiece butt end is lifted during the stroke, once on the tip rail, with the same pressure applied, that pressure is applied to a smaller or narrower area as the middle of the tip rail is approached.  And the tendency is to lift the butt end more, creating a shorter radius of curve over that tip rail area... and that is the "flip" we talk about.

But what I do, as I make the stroke across the cutting paper, the side rails draw two lines.  As soon as it begins to make a wide smear, that indicated the tip rail is being cut, I stop lifting the butt end of the mouthpiece, thus making it fat on the tip rail.  This allows the reed to close the tip all at once, giving the mouthpiece faster response.  It just plays better.

The difference between the machined curve and the flattened tip is not much.  But when a flip is cut into the tip rail it makes a lot of difference in how it plays, and not for the better.

What we want to prevent, anywhere in the curve, whether at the "break" or the tip, is a sudden change in radius, especially a sudden decrease in radius.  We want to avoid a "bump" in the curve where the reed has to bend around a kink in the curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>An exaggerated curve in the tip rail area can play with great altissimo but will sound airy in the normal sax range.  I had a Lakey like this that I gradually took out ~90% of the flip that was in it and the normal range tone cleared up but the high altissimo was still good.  
 
I find a flat tip rail or one that is curved the same as the rest of the facing is good for about an octave of altissimo on tenor with a Fibracell reed.  Putting slightly more roll in the curve at the tip rail gets me another 1/2 octave with no negative response trade-offs.   The results are more dramatic for the guys using cane reeds and playing TOP style solos.
 
I do not think measuring the tip rail inside and out will help guide this work.  It is a nice thought be we are at the limits of our measurement abilities here.  I just do something similar to what Paul describes when facing near the tip rail.  But I adjust the last bit of lift as needed to get what i want.  I look at the tip rail by eye to see how the light reflects off it.  I can tell if it is flat or has a gentle smooth roll in it.  If it has a kink in it from a sudden lift while facing near the tip, that shows up clear too.

Subject: [MouthpieceWork] No man&#39;s land. From where the side rails end to the tip. (measuring & refacing)



  
I&#39;ve been doing some thinking about the tip of a mouthpiece--specifically the area from the end of the side rails to the tip. This has led me to a few new questions and possibly some new ways of doing things.

Feeler gage measurements that don&#39;t go deep enough to reach the side rails seem to lose much of their accuracy and thus their meaning. I haven&#39;t seen any discussion online about how to handle this specific issue, so if anyone would care to share how they handle this area in any special kind of way, I&#39;d love to hear about it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Mike.

I think you raise a couple of very important points....


The first being the issue with the feeler gauges and the measurements at
the extreme tip of the mouthpiece.

I&#39;ve had, in the last couple of weeks, the (life-event, for me) pleasure of
an hour-long conversation with Mark,
from Beechler mouthpieces in Northridge CA.
During our discussion, which, I must stress, covered only the facing of the
mouthpiece
(everything that went on &#39;inside&#39; the mouthpiece was &#39;proprietary
information&#39; and therefore &#39;out of bounds&#39;....),
he pointed out several things to me:

1. The copy of the Erick Brand Band Instrument Repair Manual, with its
chapter on mouthpieces was a very good start to refacing mouthpieces.
2. I&#39;d pointed out to him that he "only" had 5-6 feeler gauges with which
to measure the mouthpiece facing.
"I told ya: Erick Brand Repair Manual is good literature. If your curve is
&#39;so&#39;....you don&#39;t need ten feeler gauges to tell you if it&#39;s right or not.
There&#39;s only so many mistakes you can make in between measuring points..."
(This means that if your curve is correct, multiple measurements aren&#39;t
going to make it any clearer to you: Curve &#39;A&#39;, leading to tip opening &#39;Z&#39;,
is not the same as curve &#39;B&#39;, leading to tip opening &#39;Z&#39;. This may shock
many, that a major manufacturer is so &#39;offhand&#39; with his
measurements....but he&#39;s not: He&#39;s correct.)
3. I asked him specifically about the issue of the mouthpiece disappearing
into no-man&#39;s land (as you put it)....
I have a (Beechler) clarinet mouthpiece exactly as you describe. I
complained that the mouthpiece was difficult in response...stuffy...yet
good once it got going.
"I bet you like it up top, hey?"
&#39;Yes; the altissimo register is great...the rest is too....&#39;breathy&#39;&#39;.
*He told me that the mouthpiece is designed like that to favour the high
register / altissimo register.*


My other (ARB &#39;Great Neck&#39; ~ also Beechler-made) is the exact
opposite...with wide, asymmetrical (in thickness) rails and a tip rail that
you could balance a bus on....the rails are wider than any (clarinet) reed
that I&#39;ve ever put on there....yet it &#39;speaks&#39; evenly in all registers and
is flexible....you can &#39;tailgate&#39; like a trombone with it....it shouldn&#39;t
work.....but it does.
Go figure.

Two things then:

(Despite my desire to &#39;lean the other way&#39;...) The feeler gauges shown in
the Erick Brand Manual are ample to measure the curve of a mouthpiece
(Beechler - designed, in any case).
A &#39;non-existent&#39; tip rail is intentional, and is designed to favour the
altissimo register. (This corroborates what I&#39;ve read elsewhere, fwiw).

I hope that helps with your query.

As an aside, I&#39;ve been experimenting with Starrett pin gauges (they&#39;re
cylindrical), in particular for the measurement of the area leading up to
the tip.
Email me in a couple of months and I&#39;ll let you know how I got on.

All the best,

David Smart.

Mark, showed me to take the tip rail measurement from the *centre of the
tip-rail*
(he did this by &#39;feel&#39; on a dial indicator protruding through a thick, flat
plate....at &#39;so many&#39; + mouthpieces per day, I guess you get a &#39;feel&#39; for
it....)
This also corroborates methods shown here and elsewhere.


All the best,

David Smart.

            <pre class='message__body'>I get best results continuing an approximation of the facing curve from the corners to the outside of the mid tip rail - no irregularities anywhere. That takes care of the reed to blowing/embouchure pressure response optimally.  More important, and the cause of all the extra resistance, is the profile of the baffle in this area.  Continuing the facing curve results in a higher, mid tip area baffle, increased response to internal air pressure changes and more Bernoulli force, often causing the reed to close too soon = the perception of blowing resistance.  In either case (flat or curved tip rail) all other aspects being equal, the shape of the baffle between the rail ends and mid tip rail, is where really great mouthpieces are made.

            <pre class='message__body'>Not fair at all. Leading you to  Erick Brand Band Instrument Repair Manual
is like suggesting a century old dental book to a medical student that has
chapter on medicine also. Probably fair if that is what he knows.
5-6 gauges are insufficient. Period. In the time of that book largest
facing was .060, now some people play on .160 with a standard being .105.
You need the larger gauges to cover the new ground.
There are no secrets about Beechler mouthpieces nor they came out with any
invention regarding mouthpieces.

 Data, I do this area by hand and eye.  The rest of the curve is right so it's going to be about the target tip opening, the only datum I worry about is how does it play.

 Measuring in this area, i just eyeball it.  It's easy to get hung up on data.  The only datum I'm worried about is how does it play.

As for the number of feeler gauges - if he says he needs 5-6 gauges to
check if a certain curve is correct, I believe him.
He&#39;s been doing it for years, makes hundreds of mouthpieces a year and
proved to me during our conversation that he can create a curve and check
it using 5-6 gauges.
As for the tip opening - I did say he uses a dial test indicator poking
through a flat surface...

As for myself, I use a set of nearly 100 pin gauges, 30-odd feeler gauges,
two different kinds of depth gauge,
my own contraption in conjunction with a hand-held depth gauge...and I have
a choice of three gauge glasses.
My production rate is a snail&#39;s pace compared to his....who&#39;s right?

This &#39;dissing&#39; someone I&#39;ve mentioned does nothing to answer the original
query....which you haven&#39;t addressed either.
Care to enlighten the OP as to why his mouthpiece has no significant tip
rail?

All the best,

David.

It could mean &#39;I&#39;m not allowed to tell you&#39; (it&#39;s not his company).
It could mean &#39;I don&#39;t know who you are...you could be from any major
competitor.&#39;
It could mean &#39;I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;.

What&#39;s with the attitude toward Beechler, guys?
Do you know these people personally?

I&#39;m surprised.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

Well....I happened to be on a once-a-lifetime holiday in the United States.
(I only had a certain amount of money to spend...and only had two weeks.)
I was in LA....not in Elkhart.
I was in Washington and NYC....a bit too far to get to see you....and Ted
Klum &#39;wasn&#39;t in&#39;.

I aspire to perfection....some say it&#39;s a mistake: there&#39;s a whole
philosophy in that.

Should I ignore the only major manufacturer on my path....or allow people
to think that, just because I visited Beechler....that&#39;s the standard I
want to attain?
That&#39;s like saying if I came to visit you, Keith, I&#39;d want to copy you.
Nope; I aim much higher than that too.
I was on a learning trip....I feel sorry for you if you think you can
*only*learn from the best!

All the best,

David.

You missed the point. This group is your best info on mouthpieces and since
you are here you are home. This is the best source of mouthpiece info you
can find, just search the archives.  You showed highest reverence to
halfway knowledge that made us react. I have nothing against Beechler, I
haven&#39;t thought about him or his mouthpieces at all for very long time. The
few I have seen haven&#39;t made in my book of good mouthpieces, making
mouthpieces fast and making them good is different. Nothing said was
intended to hurt you in any way.

            <pre class='message__body'> 

I agree totally with your earlier post about the shape of the baffle
just behind the tip rail. To me, this is really "no man&#39;s land". Small
adjustments here can make a large difference in how a mouthpiece plays.
And there is much design variation extant (compare, for example compare
roll-over baffles with ones that have a "ditch" behind the tip rail).


A small amount of resistance here seems beneficial in some cases - it
feels to me as though it results in a certain uniformity of resistance
over the range of the horn, but at the cost of less projection. The
small hump on Selmers imparts this feel. OTOH, the deep ditch of the
Rico graftonite also does this - unpleasantly however, and a greater
cost of projection. 

If Beechler has developed a good method of finely
tuning this zone, it might well be considered proprietary. That said, I
haven&#39;t played on or worked on any Beechlers. Whether they have anything
special going for them remains unknown to me.

Period. In the time of that book largest facing was .060, now some
people play on .160 with a standard being .105. You need the larger
gauges to cover the new ground.

Nothing you wrote I took personally.
I&#39;m just amazed at the level of animosity toward another individual
(employee from Beechler).
I didn&#39;t "show reverence" to halfway knowledge at all...It was a
&#39;life-time&#39; experience for me...I doubt if I&#39;ll make it back to the USA
again...(on holiday)...who knows?

But thanks for the reply.


David.

I agree totally with your earlier post about the shape of the baffle just behind the tip rail.  To me, this is really "no man&#39;s land". Small adjustments here can make a large difference in how a mouthpiece plays. And there is much design variation extant (compare, for example compare roll-over baffles with ones that have a "ditch" behind the tip rail).
A small amount of resistance here seems beneficial in some cases - it feels to me as though it results in a certain uniformity of resistance over the range of the horn, but at the cost of less projection. The small hump on Selmers imparts this feel. OTOH, the deep ditch of the Rico graftonite also does this - unpleasantly however, and a greater cost of projection.
If Beechler has developed a good method of finely tuning this zone, it might well be considered proprietary. That said, I haven&#39;t played on or worked on any Beechlers. Whether they have anything special going for them remains unknown to me.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

I think you should read my post again...English is my first language (your
comment is somewhat baffling since we&#39;ve spoken on the phone before...) and
I think I gave a well-written account of my visit to Beechler.

I addressed the fact that the tip rail of my mouthpiece (like the OP&#39;s),
was non-existent which means that depending on the shape of the baffle,
it&#39;s unlikely to be flat.
I was told (by Beechler....who make a mouthpiece like that), that it is to
favour the altissimo register.
They do the same on some saxophone mouthpieces.

On the subject of refacing mouthpieces (I&#39;d asked about other literature),
he told me that the Erick Brand manual was a
*good place to start.*
Given that the guy makes God knows how many mouthpieces per year, I thought
it remarkable that he only uses 5-6 feeler gauges to check the facing he&#39;s
just put on the mouthpiece.
I suppose I should have said that he has other feeler gauges...and that he
uses certain sets of gauges for certain mouthpieces, but that he relies on
5-6 measurements / feelers for each mouthpiece.

This approach to craftsmanship is not unknown..."less is more".
I&#39;ve seen guys in Taiwan put a saxophone together with a third of the tools
on the bench that I use...
I&#39;ve also worked in a couple of the saxophone factories that some people
revere as if they were temples of perfection...
...some of the things they do to instruments would make you wince and look
away...
...if only some people knew.

Some people are capable of doing the same thing as others with fewer tools.
The point about there only being so many mistakes you can make in a curve
(an action which he performs...thousands of times in a year?),
is relevant.
He probably knows the curve for each of the mouthpieces so well that he can
trace it without the mouthpiece in his hand....&#39;in his sleep&#39;, if you like.

Personally; I&#39;m in awe of this philosophy...it can probably only be
followed when a) there is complete confidence in your skills and b) when
there is a demand for high production figures.
I&#39;ll bet Mark at Beechler hasn&#39;t got the luxury of taking more than 6
measurements either...it&#39;s not that kind of work.

Right now, I own thousands of £&#39;s of tools that have been acquired with
measuring mouthpieces in mind.
I&#39;m even &#39;departing&#39; from feeler gauges (because they&#39;re so hard to come
by) and experimenting with pin gauges
for the last third of the facing (toward the tip).
No; I&#39;m definitely the type that likes lots of tools and information around
me...

But enough of explaining my (open) attitude toward other methods...
The question has long been answered and we are miles from the original
discussion.
I&#39;ll refrain from including my holiday experiences in future, however
&#39;nice&#39; they are...
...and stick to facts.

Regards,

David.

            <pre class='message__body'>I don&#39;t see anyone dissing B&#39;chler mouthpieces.  It&#39;s just a reaction to a strong, generalized statement with which there is disagreement.  

As for the reading list - that is easy.  You have to read everything available on all aspects of the saxophone, again and again, until you can relate all of it, bit by bit, to your own playing experience.

No need to ride the word &#39;proprietary&#39;.

(The need for companies to protect the information they consider theirs is very real.)

Small adjustments here can make a large difference in how a mouthpiece plays. And there is much design variation extant (compare, for example compare roll-over baffles with ones that have a "ditch" behind the tip rail).
>A small amount of resistance here seems beneficial in some cases - it feels to me as though it results in a certain uniformity of resistance over the range of the horn, but at the cost of less projection. The small hump on Selmers imparts this feel. OTOH, the deep ditch of the Rico graftonite also does this - unpleasantly however, and a greater cost of projection.

it is representative of any degree of skill (accuracy).  That is a pretty
big assumption.

Hearing that he only "relies" on 5-6 measurements makes sense to me based
on the Beechler mouthpieces that I have measured myself, none of which I
would consider well executed.  Mark Shim, an accomplished saxophonist here
in NY has a Beechler tenor mouthpiece that was "custom" made for him at a
tip opening of .140".  I&#39;m not sure how it would even be possible to cut
the curve on a mouthpiece that open with 5 or 6 measurements.  The length
of the facing on that particular mouthpiece is 30mm+...

you obviously disagree, but it still exists.

Your (cleverly worded) response is based on....how many Beechler
mouthpieces? One. (going by your post).

I don&#39;t wish to get into an argument.

I&#39;ve already made clear to Keith that I&#39;ll keep my &#39;holiday snaps&#39; out of
here....no need to stir the pot.

Regards,

David.

            <pre class='message__body'>(To Keith)

Well, what I was trying to say in point 2 is that if he has already
established that the curve is correct,
he&#39;s then subsequently &#39;copying&#39; it, and only needs 5-6 feelers to confirm
what he&#39;s just done.
(he also has a clarinet by his side, which I didn&#39;t mention).

I&#39;m aware that many here like to achieve highly accurate measurements
(I&#39;m one of them)
and generally with quite a lot more equipment than I described being used
(I&#39;m one of them)
and I certainly didn&#39;t mean to vex anyone, I just felt like remarking how
others do things.

I&#39;ve had an instructor who could cut strips one-tenth of a mm, repeatedly,
from paper...with a scalpel,
I&#39;ve seen another edge and face an 8-foot board of lumber with a Stanley
No4...where I&#39;d have to use a No6 or 7,
Another told me from across the room that I&#39;d reached the final dimension
on the clarinet bell I was turning...he &#39;heard it&#39;.
Mark, at Beechler, is one of these people.

You can train your eye / ear to do these things...as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware.

That&#39;s all I wanted to point out.

I appreciate greatly the amount of information that is on these boards
and as a professional craftsman (granted, not as &#39;far along the road&#39; as
some here, concerning mouthpieces),
who has always tried to do things to the best of my ability,
and has seen the many ways many craftsmen work around the world,
I&#39;m very surprised at the (collective) reaction to someone using a
curiously low number of feeler gauges in his day-to-day work.

All the best,

David.

It&#39;s funny how an offhand post can draw so much interest...

From a production basis, that is not bad.  The main measurements would be the tip and facing length (with the .0015" feeler).  The other spot checks would be to make sure the facing is even on both sides.  What the actual numbers are would be set by the machinery cutting the facing.  That is mostly machine work, not hand work.  So the feelers used would be those in the areas of the facing concerning any hand work.

Making a new mouthpiece, with a machine cut facing is somewhat different from refacing / altering a facing.

            <pre class='message__body'>If you want to experience the "no tip rail", shift your reed down on the table slightly.  I&#39;m pretty sure everyone that does good work on mouthpieces went through the stage where they, leaving the tip rail for last, omitted it entirely, since they hadn&#39;t perfected the process, or just wanted to see what would happen.  It gives you slightly more high frequency components but at the cost of tonal stability in the attack transient phase of each note.  The increased highs may perhaps improve altissimo response, but the trade-off is not worth it, IMO, if you care about your tone/response in the normal range.  One can easily attain the same added highs and altissimo response without suffering attack transient instability everywhere else, by using a definite tip rail and thinning the tip of the reed ever so slightly.

I have to agree with both of your last posts. (martinmods)

Initially, that was my complaint, that it (the mouthpiece) didn&#39;t speak and
wasn&#39;t flexible once it had eventually got going.
(you&#39;re right: It&#39;s not worth it)

I have in mind to establish a tip rail on it...I&#39;ll let you know how I got
on.

David.

I have to agree with both of your last posts. (martinmods)

Initially, that was my complaint, that it (the mouthpiece) didn&#39;t speak and wasn&#39;t flexible once it had eventually got going.

(you&#39;re right: It&#39;s not worth it)

I have in mind to establish a tip rail on it...I&#39;ll let you know how I got on.

The pins for measuring?

They&#39;re good (there&#39;s a great choice and they are (by piece) a lot cheaper
than feeler gauges), although they did require a substantial initial outlay.

I&#39;m still getting my head around the mathematics of using them:
Obviously, there&#39;s only a part of the cylinder touching the facing....where
do you take your reading from?
The &#39;top&#39; of the pin (making sure your eye is square with the pin and the
graduation on the glass gauge)?
The part of the pin touching the glass gauge?
The &#39;bottom&#39; of the pin (again, making sure your eye is square with the pin
and the graduation on the glass gauge)?

That&#39;s the stage I&#39;m at, at the moment.
So far, my opinion centres around it not mattering much...consistency being
the most important factor.
If, for example, I find it easier to take a reading from where the pin
touches the glass gauge.....and you (for example) measure the mpiece later,
as long as you use the same size pins....*and read them in the same
way*...there
should be no problems.

I&#39;ll let you know....but I think I&#39;ll start another thread on the subject.

Thanks for your interest.

All the best,

David.

 He used the feeler gauges to check the facing he put on a

 He checked it before he started and each time he did something to the

 I appreciate your point (the moulding did 90% of the work).



David, the only mouthpiece I'm aware of that the facing is molded on was the Rico 
Graftonite and Metalite mouthpieces.  It was designed to be molded only, no 
handwork at all.

I was talking about a facing being machined onto a mouthpiece blank.  Is this step 
done on the Beechler mouthpieces by hand?

On the Runyon mouthpieces after the table and facing are cut, the next step is to 
file the tip contour to the shape that matches the reed profile.  After that the baffle 
and tip rail work is done by hand.  But the table and most of the facing is as it is 
machined.

The Runyon facing machines were designed by Mr. Runyon and custom built for 
that purpose.  These are not "off the shelf" items you can buy anywhere.

It would seem that the blanks are both molded and go through a CNC process.

He was definitely working on the facing of the mouthpieces that had just
been through that process.

He had to remove the &#39;flash&#39; before working on the mouthpiece,
and the inside of the mouthpiece wasn&#39;t shiny...so I assume it had just
been machined (and had yet to be polished )

(I don&#39;t know if this is the norm...perhaps the blanks were from a batch
that needed finishing....? I don&#39;t know.)

Regards,

David.

I have a recent Graftonite. The facing has the fine shallow arc

            <pre class='message__body'>A difference in baffle contour between the corners and tip rail of .0025mm (.0001") is readily noticable.  You can&#39;t measure this area with guages.  Those minute contour differences manifest themselves in where the Bernoulli force snaps the reed closed in relation to where that occurance and the range of reed response to internal air pressure changes fall on the downward slope of air flow vs blowing/embouchure pressure.  Sounds complicated, but that&#39;s what it is - see woodwind acoustics 101.  You can&#39;t measure it.  You have to feel it.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks to everyone for so much useful information! This site is unmeasurably more helpful than SOTW (I know it is a low bar, but I hope you know what I mean).
 

 It's helpful for me to know the consensus max and min range for any single aspect of mouthpieces before really getting into it myself. This makes it much more rewarding for me the first time I do it myself. That way I can be sure to be in the ball-park the first time. Also it prevents wasted time trying to reinvent the wheel. I can always experiment outside the normal range later (ie. if my preferences are at one extreme of that range.) Thanks to everyone that contributed along those lines...
 

 Also, thanks to those encouraging me to look forward to the next challenge--baffles--as well. All of those comments were super helpful.
 

 I just wanted to clear up one issue:
 David,
 You mentioned several times about the "OP" and having a "non-existent" tip rail.
 I re-read my initial post, and it's unclear to me where you got this. I asked about flat vs. curved tip rails, but in both of these cases there is a clearly defined and measurable tip rail.
 

 Thanks again. You guys are awesome!
 Mike
