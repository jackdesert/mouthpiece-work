    Dan,

    While I thought the sound of the orange piece was nice,
    I REALLY liked the tone and the edge of the blue one. That’s the kind of
    sound that I’ve been looking for out of a HR/Acrylic piece but have not
    found… Let me know if you are going to be making more of those, I’d love
    to get my hands on one…

    >>>Hi Keith, I don&#39;t understand what you mean by "anything in-between". 

    A quadratic equation is Y=aX^2+bX+c. If a=0 you get a pure straight line, if b=0 you get a pure parabolic curve. But if a=.5 and b=.5 you get half a line and half a parabola. This is what I mean by an "in-between" curve. "c" just determines where it crosses the Y axis when X=0.

    For a facing curve, a, b, c are actually determined by the data set and a least squares analysis. They are difficult to tweek on your own to make a facing curve that is a little more open/closed. Theo actually came up with a linear fit for facing length based on tip opening and also a, b, c based on tip opening (I going from memory here but you can check his site). So he can get different curves based on tip opening. But only one type of curve for each tip opening and facing length the way he uses it.

    I like elliptical curves since I can deal in just 3 terms to describe a target curve. The tip opening, facing length and the ratio of the major/minor axis of the ellipse that passes through the tip and facing length. After a while, you get a feel for what different ratios can do. Also, a ratio of "1" is the same as a radial curve. 

    The same can be done with the variable exponent curve, though I have not worked with this curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi:

What tip opening is that blue piece, and are they available?  By the way, you sound like a really hip player.  Nice, swinging feel, and cool note choices.

I would like to know more about these, like where they are made, and what tip openings they are in.

Thanks,

Bob

one plays louder mainly due to the higher internal rollover baffle. 

Thank you for your comments.

> Sax and Clarinet Mouthpiece WorkI like the blue one too. And great 

playing btw. More center and a little more complex tone, though they 

are both good. The orange one seems to be louder but don&#39;t know how 

you recorded each.

straight line, if b=0 you get a pure parabolic curve. But if a=.5 and 

b=.5 you get half a line and half a parabola. This is what I mean by 

an "in-between" curve. "c" just determines where it crosses the Y 

axis when X=0.

set and a least squares analysis. They are difficult to tweek on your 

own to make a facing curve that is a little more open/closed. Theo 

actually came up with a linear fit for facing length based on tip 

opening and also a, b, c based on tip opening (I going from memory 

here but you can check his site). So he can get different curves 

based on tip opening. But only one type of curve for each tip opening 

and facing length the way he uses it.

describe a target curve. The tip opening, facing length and the ratio 

of the major/minor axis of the ellipse that passes through the tip 

and facing length. After a while, you get a feel for what different 

ratios can do. Also, a ratio of "1" is the same as a radial curve.
