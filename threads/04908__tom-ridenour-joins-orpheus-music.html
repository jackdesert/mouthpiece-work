  _____  


Famed clarinet designer Tom Ridenour has joined our parent company, Orpheus
Music, to oversee clarinet and clarinet accessory production. Ridenour
clarinets and accessories will now be distributed by Orpheus Music, and will
be sold by Orpheus dealers, including my retail site www.nationofmusic.
&lt;http://www.nationofmusic.com./> com. Several new lines of high quality
clarinets will be developed to compliment the Orpheus offerings of
saxophones and flutes. 

I look forward to working with Tom. He&#39;s one of the very, very few people in
the world who actually understands what is going on inside a horn. I&#39;ve got
much to learn from him! Tom will, in addition to his design duties, make
appearances and conduct master classes for our dealers and at trade shows.
You can visit Tom&#39;s website and read some of his excellent clarinet articles
at http://www.ridenour &lt;http://www.ridenourclarinetproducts.com/>

Here&#39;s a brief biography of Tom: 

Tom Ridenour, a native of Kentucky, received his Bachelor&#39;s Degree in
performance from Murray State University and his Master&#39;s degree in clarinet
performance from Yale University. 
He taught for more than a decade at Wesleyan University, Hartt College, and
the University of Connecticut. He also was active as a chamber musician,
soloist and recording artist in the New York, New England area. In 1984 Tom
gave the North American premiere of Robert Muczynski&#39;s Time Pieces for
clarinet and piano. 

He served as manager of the Woodwind Company at Leblanc Corp. where he
participated in a number of activities, including the creation of new
products, clarinet design, giving educational work shops, and working with
artists. In 1997 Tom moved his family to Duncanville, Texas where he resumed
his work in Ridenour Clarinet Products, specializing in artist hand made
mouthpieces and clarinet acoustical and mechanical work. 

Tom has lectured, performed and presented workshops and master classes all
over North America. He has written extensively on virtually every aspect of
the clarinet. His book, Clarinet Fingerings: A Guide for the Performer and
Educator has sold continuously for almost two decades and is widely regarded
as the standard reference on the subject. Tom has also written the first
complete pedagogy of the clarinet in the instrument&#39;s history; The
Educator&#39;s Guide to the Clarinet, and his new book, The Definitive Guide to
Successful Reed Finishing presents a completely revolutionary new and easy
method for fine balancing reeds, making the ability to finish reeds
accessible to players of all levels of development. Tom seeks to combine his
skills as an artist, educator, acoustician and technician to create a
complete approach to clarinetistry.
