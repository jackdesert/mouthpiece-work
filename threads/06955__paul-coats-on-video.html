            <pre class='message__body'>Hi to all 
This is my first post although I follow the community posts for months and have browsed all topics in yahoo group.
The reason to subscribe was that I had bought a used (rare?) metal &#39;MIAMI&#39; Dukoff #6 mouthpiece from ebay and when received I noticed it condition was very bad:the inside was very rough and ?rusty and some small scarfs all around and some on the tip rail.
Playing produced a strange sound will lot of squirks.
Using the photos for a Dukoff on the groups (and VERY SCARED at the beginning) I worked with it and after some nights of work I managed to get it playable and may I say enjoyable!
 
The only problem I have is that some notes on the lower octave do not come so easy (sometimes tune on the next octave, like G, A) and I overcome by puting some more mouthpiece in to sound ok (?? dont ask why...I do not know...)
What would you propose?
 
thanking you in advance 
Gianni V.
P.S. I am amateur sax player playing only a couple of years for fun.
I use a YAMAHA YAS-475 in very good condition and using the standard 4C mouthpie I have no issues although the sound is NOT GREAT!
