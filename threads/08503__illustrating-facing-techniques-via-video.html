            <pre class='message__body'>The link below takes you to a video we did today to show WITHOUT A LOT OF

information to a potential buyer? Is it clear enough? Comments appreciated!
We sincerely wish to provide as much information as is necessary. We made
this short and omitted a lot of detail out of fear that the viewer&#39;s
attention span might be limited!

            <pre class='message__body'>From Jimmitch>>Great job on that Steve .That should help you sell mouthpieces.A little tip I use spray glue to hold the sand paper on the glass, It helps a lot and it&#39;s not hard to get off the glass if you don&#39;t use to much.
