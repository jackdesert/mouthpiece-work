          I&#39;m having some issuses with my mouthpieces.  Some of them are playing a little flat, is this because the chamber is to big?  My experience would tell me yes, but if there is something else please let me know.  The other thing is, when articulated in the upper register it squeaks. From my experience this tells me that the baffle and or, the area right behind the tip may be to high.  Please let me know. Thanks
