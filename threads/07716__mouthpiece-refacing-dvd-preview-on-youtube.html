I bought the DVD. Honestly I was rather dissappointed with the content.
I think it would be a good idea to mention how basic it is. I expected a
bit more for a $100 plus shipping. The quality of the filming is good,
nice shirt Steve, but again totally lacking in content. All you have to
do is read a few articles on this forum, gather a few basic tools,
obtain a few beatup mpces, and spend some time on the sandpaper and
gauges and you are way beyond what this DVD has to offer you relative to
useful information. Of course if you have never read any info on these
sites and never worked on any mpces, ever, this would be a good DVD, but
I think this should be the qualification in the advertising. This is
just my opinion of course.  I threw away a $100, no need for you to do
the same.  Nothing personal against Steve G., I own some of his sax
repair tapes and they proved valuable and well done.

believe we have ever once said it was anything but that. Glad you like the
shirt. We&#39;ve sold a lot of these DVD&#39;s. Your&#39;s has been the ONLY negative
comment. Maybe we should consider an advanced refacing and modification DVD
for customers such as yourself.
