            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for posting this link, Keith. It is interesting and timely because currently on the auction market are 2 vintage Saxworks David Sanborn models asking $2500 and $3500 with a buy it now of $5K on the later.  A truly absurd amount of money for a mouthpiece. It will be interesting to see if there are any takers. 

Does anyone have any observations or experience with these Saxworks mouthpieces to draw any conclusions as to the quality or similarity with the Dukoff model that they are based upon?

Also, concerning the ligature, that wedge that secures the ligature appears to be too large and possibly a distraction that competes with the music produced by the saxophonist using it.
