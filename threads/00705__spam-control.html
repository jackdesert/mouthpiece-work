            <pre class='message__body'>You guys are tough.  At least the few that responded are.

I deleted the Gato spam and the follow-up discussion.  I have also 
changed the membership setting to restricted so I have to approve 
membership before they can post or add links and files.  Non-members 
can still read all the info here.

I&#39;ll test this out, but I&#39;m not sure that the solution is not worse 
than the problem.  Either way, I think it&#39;s a minor annoyance.

You guys are tough.  At least the few that responded are.

I deleted the Gato spam and the follow-up discussion.  I have also

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve had this problem on another group before (one that I moderate). 
Sometimes it seems that Yahoo changes your settings for you so that 
people can get in again without being apporved. As soon as this 
happens, the spam starts again. Just my 2c worth.
