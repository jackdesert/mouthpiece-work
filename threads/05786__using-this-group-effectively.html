            <pre class='message__body'>Thank you so much for the video link showing the mouthpiece measure and 
reface.I won&#39;t have anything meaningfull to say about refacing as I 
joined this group to learn it.I suggest that any new member that 
doesn&#39;t have microsoft office get open office as it opens all the excel 
files and most others for 9.00 instead of spending 150-500 for the  
microsoft version.If anyone knows where I can get software to open the 
perl file for reasonable money I would appreciate it.Thanks for having 
this group.I&#39;ve been a repair tech for 12 years but don&#39;t know squat 
about mouthpieces.I am learning so much and appreciate everyones 
willingness to share,regards,Ted
