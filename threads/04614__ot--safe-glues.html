            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

Sorry for the O T post.
I&#39;ve been repairing woodwinds for the past 30 years and seem to be experiencing
symptoms that can be explained by long term exposure to Toluene which is a component
of the contact adhesive (and other solvents) I use to attach corks.
Can people recommend other suitable adhesives that are considered relatively safe or
atleast don&#39;t contain Toluene.

Thanks,

David Bowater

  These are just a few.  Many lumberyards carry water based contact cement.

            <pre class='message__body'>I first became aware of latex water based contact cements for gluing balsa sheeting to styrofoam cores for forming wings for radio control model aircraft.  Solvent based contact cements would, of course, melt the foam.
   
  When laminating cabinet tops (Formica, etc) it is usual practice to clean up any drips with a rag an lacquer thinner.  This can&#39;t be done with the water based products, but you can wipe it up before it dries with a damp rag or sponge.
