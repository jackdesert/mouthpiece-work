  Bakelite is also highly combustible, so keep it away from flames or cigs! Cheers.

  Hi to everybody.
  Not  to step on anybody&#39;s toes but Bakelite is a thermosetting plastic that is non-flammable and is even used for inslators in electrical applications. It has a unique smell when burned or put to a grinding wheel.   Check out www.deco-echoes.com/bakelite.html which gives somewhat of a history of the substance.

  PS-I&#39;ve been luring around and really enjoy this form.  If ever I get the time,I plan to go through my draw of old MC&#39;s and see if I can improve them.  At least for now I&#39;m happy with my 30 year 115/2 Berg SS bari(my main instrument) as well as all of my other sax MC&#39;s.
