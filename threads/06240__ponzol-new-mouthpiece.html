            <pre class='message__body'>Somebody has tested the new production of Peter Ponzol? I mean the
stainless mouthpiece that he describe as fantastic and better than the
previous made in brass?

...and what about the alluminium anodized. I&#39;ve only tested a Zagar
finding the piece without a good resonance.

That&#39;s fantastic if it is true...

Ciao everybody.

            <pre class='message__body'>There are several reviews of the SS Ponzols on SOTW.Â  It is a better forum for this type of information.
