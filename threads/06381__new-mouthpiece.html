            <pre class='message__body'>I have just received an Amati 6 mouthpiece with my new C Clarinet.  I 
have shared on this list that I use the Pyne "S" series for my Bb 
Clarinet and the 5RV for my Eb Clarinet.  I felt better tone-wise with 
my Pyne "S" on the C Clarinet.  I have those new reeds from Vandoren on 
the C Clarinet.  I wanted to know if the Amati 6 mouthpiece is not a 
beginner&#39;s mouthpiece. 

Please advise.

I have just received an Amati 6 mouthpiece with my new C Clarinet.  I have shared on this list that I use the Pyne "S" series for my Bb Clarinet and the 5RV for my Eb Clarinet.  I felt better tone-wise with my Pyne "S" on the C Clarinet.  I have those new reeds from Vandoren on the C Clarinet.  I wanted to know if the Amati 6 mouthpiece is not a beginner&#39;s mouthpiece.  

Please advise.
