As Joe has found time to post mouthpiece lay schedules for various 
practitioners, per Claude Humber, I thought I&#39;d start by saying 
thanks for the info! 
Joe, if and when you feel like posting more of this info about other 
greats, perhaps this could serve as the thread. 
Thanks in advance!

Ol&#39; Mpc Doc 
User ID: 1773974  Nov 7th 11:30 PM
This refers back to the "Reeds & Mouthpieces 3" area and "Joe&#39;s" 
posting of several facing curve "schedules" for prominent players as 
listed in Claude Humber&#39;s logs. I do not know and mean no disrespect 
for "Joe" but am quite familiar and most respectful of Claude 
Humber&#39;s earlier work. The "numbers" Joe has posted are "interesting" 
but absolutely useless as a basis for any understanding or specifying 
any refacing work to be "identical to the masters" he&#39;s listed. And 
several of the facing curves he&#39;s listed are totally irrational as 
well as incomplete. Some others are simply "blueprint" numbers and 
don&#39;t reflect any particular "customizing" to improve response for 
the players listed. 

For example, a Coltrane metal Link with a 0.100" tip opening is shown 
with a curve of "27-20-15-12-8 
while a Coltrane metal Link with a 0.096" tip opening is shown with a 
curve of "26-10-15-12-8, (obviously a "typo" on the second number). I 
have a completely unaltered New York Super ToneMaster custom-made for 
Coltrane by Otto Link with a tip opening of 0.087" and a curve of 25-
18-13-10-7. A lot depends on the refacer&#39;s "touch" and it&#39;s well-
known that the crystal gauges for measuring facing curves and 
the &#39;wand-type" gauges for measuring tip openings are horribly 
inconsistent. These variables render such listings worthless 
as "reliable references" or "guidelines". 

The thickest feeler gauge in the Erick Brand, Morgan and Babbitt 
refacing kits is 0.050". This is adequate for clarinet and soprano 
sax mpcs but just doesn&#39;t provide accurate measurements for alto, 
tenor and baritone saxes with longer facing curves and larger tip 
openings. Only the Winslow kit has a larger assortment of blade 
gauges but these are still inadequate (in my opinion) for really 
accurate work over the entire length of a facing curve and across the 
tip rail. 

The problem with not using correct gauges any larger than 0.050" 
means that 0.25" to 0.30" of the actual facing curve nearest the tip 
on a typical tenor sax mpc is completely immeasureable and this is 
arguably the most important part of the facing curve as it affects 
the amplitude of travel of the thinnest part of the reed (which is 
also moving at the highest speed at any given frequency). The same 
problem to a lesser degree (but no less important!) exists on 
measuring ANY mpc where there is any significant facing curve length 
extending beyond the point of rest of the 0.050" blade gauge. And the 
larger the tip opening, the more room there is for error. 

Beware of what you think you may have learned from such listings! 

With all due respect to all.

Thanks Doc. We need these "checks and balances" posts. 

On that .100" Coltrane example, the .050" feeler is 8 mm from the tip 
of the mouthpiece. This is a very short distance to go from .050" 
to .100". I was curious as to what this curve looked like, since it 
is not documented with the Erick Brand system. If real, whatever the 
curve is would play with a lot of resistance. Perhaps he had reeds 
with thin tips. 

For my work, I use a set of 10 feeler gauges up to .095". I really 
need to pick up a couple more large ones since some monster tips go 
to .150".

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,
excuse the newbie question.

I have a Master Link that has been worked on and I would like to compare the curve to those posted here, but I generally use feelers in steps of .005.
Thank you
