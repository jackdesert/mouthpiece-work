            <pre class='message__body'>I have been thinking about a Selmer or a Vandoren mouthpiece for the 
soprano and tenor saxophones.  I would like to know
am I "thinking" in the right area for mouthpieces.  I do not want that 
bright jazz tone for these two saxophones.  I would like
some feedback about these two brands.

Thanks in advance for your help!

            <pre class='message__body'>This is a broad question that might be better served by posting it on Sax On The Web.
 
Vandoren mouthpieces are very well made factory mouthpieces.  They offers several designs for alto and tenor sax.  They have fewer offerings for soprano and bari.  They have bright and dark designs for tenor but just medium to bright designs for soprano.  IMO
 
Selmers are more inconsistent in their facing work.  They offer several designs but they all tend to be medium to bright.
