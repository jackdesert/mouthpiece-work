I never had a "muk" problem.  I dont know what you have on it but 
there are several hardware/paint store solvents that are useful to 
have around the house.  Lacquer Thinner desolves a whole buncha 
stuff.  Denatured Alcohol is fine for a lot of glues.  Naphtha does 
some odd-ball stuff.

As for the scratches, I get them too.  If you file the side rails to 
make them thinner on metal mouthpieces, burrs will stick up that will 
scratch your glass guage.  They should be lightly sanded first.  All 
metal dust needs to be removed from the table too.  Stainless Steel 
is especially tough on the glass guage.

I have not tried to sand out the scratches but this might work.  I 
have an old guage I may try it on.  I&#39;ll probably try some Mylar 
adheasive-backed sandpaper with some oil on it.
