Large bore clarinets would include the old Boosey and Hawkes 1010 series and the Peter Eaton Elite (I believe). The mouthpieces for thse are variously available from Dawkes, Peter Eaton and Ed Pillinger, all in the UK. Another step is to have your repairman ream out an old mouthpiece to match the bore of your existing large bore instrument. The reaming process, although irreversible, will not affect the re-made mouthpiece on your clarinet.
I hope this is of some use to you. Robin!

I have a large bore clarinet and I believe I will get better intonation characteristics with a stout or large bore mouthpiece. I would appreciate if someone could give suggestions about brands and models. Thanks.

I use a large bore B & H Emperor, which at .593" is the same as the
Regent & Imperial/926. The cheap American Rico Royal Graftonite is a
large bore mouthpiece, .600" - 15.2mm  works well with these and lends
itself to refacing. Another one is the ROC (British) from the 60&#39;s.
