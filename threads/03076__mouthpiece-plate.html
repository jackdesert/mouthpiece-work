Go to the site Messages and Search Archive on the word "Bite".  
Hit "Next" as needed since they only give a page or so of hits at a 
time.

For replacements and repairs, I use a 2-part acrylic by 3M that is no 
longer made in black.  I&#39;ll be trying other 3M acrylics when it runs 
out, or I&#39;ll use clear with a black pigment mixed in.

For repairs, you can fill tooth gouges in with almost any 2-part 
epoxy.  But it is recommended that you cover hte repair with a tooth 
patch to be on the safe side.

            <pre class='message__body'>I had a quick look, but it is too much information at
this stage, since I am just starting and this will be
my first mouthpiece to work on. I wanted to ask you if
I use a bit of plastic cut to shape, what is the best
and safest glue that I can use?

Thanks

Is the 3M 2-part acrylic safer to use?, I mean to compare with the  
2-part epoxy product?, or are they all the same?.

Sorry to give you hard time but from what I read from several 
messages in here, I am a little bit worried to put the stuff near my 
mouth.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think epoxies and acrylics are both safe when thouroughly mixed and
cured.  However, unmixed epoxy parts can be nasty over time with a lot of
exposure.  I think acrylic parts are safer.  This is my opinion from
reading the various snippets of info tossed around here.  There is no
definative source that will tell you these products are safe to put in your
mouth.  Even if they do (like dental materials) they may be proven wrong
over time.

            <pre class='message__body'>I like using either E6000 or Alene&#39;s 7800 craft glues.  Any excess that 
oozes out should be allowed to dry, and then scraped away with your 
fingernail.  It will come off cleanly. 

These glues may be found in craft and hobby stores, and the craft 
department of Walmart.  They are both "SBR adhesives" (styrene butadyene 
rubber), Alene&#39;s 7800 is a little thinner than E6000.  I use E6000 for 
plastic thumb rests and other jobs.
