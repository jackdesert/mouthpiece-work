Wider tips are easier to bend the pitch/less stable.  This is a bigger deal
than facing length.

Sealing the sax leaks.  Also, getting a smooth facing curve without any
bumps or flat sections.

I have found long lays with open tips difficult to control regarding
pitch, unless masking the problem by using vibrato. I now tend to go
the other way, same tip opening but short length. This does not seem
to spoil the low end - I use subtone on tenor - but allows plenty of
controlled flexibility in pitch.   Eddie.
