            <pre class='message__body'>I was wondering if anyone knew of any experiments or research to revamp the standard sax mouthpiece, reed & ligature arraignment, say a one piece set-up combining all three elements or maybe some totally new way of producing sound from the physical input of the player? This might also include experiments involving the saxophone neck.
