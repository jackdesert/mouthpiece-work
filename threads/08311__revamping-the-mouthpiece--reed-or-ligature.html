            <pre class='message__body'>I was wondering if anyone knew of any experiments or research to revamp the standard sax mouthpiece, reed & ligature arraignment, say a one piece set-up combining all three elements or maybe some totally new way of producing sound from the physical input of the player? This might also include experiments involving the saxophone neck.

            <pre class='message__body'>It&#39;s not new, but didn&#39;t Eddie Harris play some sax using a trombone
mouthpiece at one point?  (And trumpet using a modified sax mouthpiece).

            <pre class='message__body'>The Wanne mouthpieces have an integrated ligature.  Others in the past have done the same thing.  

This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t take the lig off and use a different one, but the Wanne is made as a system.
