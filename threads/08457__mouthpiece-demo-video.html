to continually view the item in the video screen while the description is
ongoing so that the mpc is always in focus by not bringing it too close to
the camera. Other than that, I think it&#39;s a great way to advertise a
product.

            <pre class='message__body'>We’ve wrestled with this return policy business, and find that low price sells. We can keep our prices low by requiring that any returns be received by us within the same time frame as it took to get them to the customer. We’ve actually had people try to return mouthpieces after SIX months! Our policy is apparently acceptable to most buyers, as supply and demand are pretty much the same for our mouthpieces. I am well aware that some people don’t think our policy is lenient enough, but since we’re selling all we can make at present, that’s business I can afford to miss……..If you look at our feedback on eBay (which we can’t control or influence in any way) we have apparently made an awful lot of people very happy with our mouthpieces and other products.

The product description is good.  If you have a money-back trial period in your terms, I would mention it.  This always offers the best protection to the buyer for getting the quality and fit they are looking for.  Of course, if the price is low enough that the buyer feels they can re-sell it on eBay for about the same price as they paid for it, then a money-back trial is less important.

That said. 
The video gives me enough info including a headache from watching it jiggle all over the place. 
Perhaps a tripod mount in the future.

"Will usually ship within 3 business days of receiving cleared payment"

The store&#39;s return policy states:

"All returns must be RECEIVED by us within three days of delivery to you
with NO exceptions".

USPS priority mail takes 2 to 3 days to ship depending on the time the
package is posted.  That means a customer must try the mouthpiece and
ship by return mail the same day it arrives otherwise it will not get
back to you within the 3 days and will not be accepted.  There is also a
$20 or $25 cleaning and sterilization fee charged for any mouthpiece
returned.

By comparison, WWBW  sells many top quality mouthpieces in an assortment
of tip openings for low prices and allows a 45 day return privilege.  
Mouthpieces under $300 are acessed a $4.00 cleaning and sterilization
fee, those over $300 and $8.00 fee.  If you exchange for another
mouthpiece, they will even pay your return shipping.

It is possible to rationalize that customers must not have a problem
with these restrictive sales policies since  a lot of merchandise is
sold.  However, it raises the question of how many more potential sales
are lost because of the number of people who are turned away by the low
regard for customer satisfaction these overly restrictive policies
suggest.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

 

I am mostly a lurker here, trying to learn, so my opinion might not count
for much.

 

So If I may be so bold as to suggest the following:

 

- Maybe stop and focus / zoom in on, and / or point to, the different
elements of the Mouthpiece as you mention them rather than manually turning
the mouthpiece. 

- Maybe use the turning of the mouthpiece as a couple second intro.
Preferably without turning it by hand.

- Try and keep the engraving of name of the product in focus when you pass
it.

- Use a different background, one that makes the mouthpiece really stand
out. Maybe black or something with a small company logo that will not take
the attention away from the mouthpiece. The eye should was want to be drawn
to the mouthpiece.

- Don&#39;t let the LED of the camera or any image reflect in the mouthpiece.

- Make the camera steady. I understand you are using a "flip cam". Even when
your using a flip cam don&#39;t let it have jerking movement when you pan left
or right, for example your  Musicmedic mouthpiece facing clinic video,
fantastic content, but only average camera work. I&#39;m sorry to say that the
camera work let you down. Also you should have had a radio mic.

- Maybe suggest a preferred reed. Or say that the feedback from  people is
that reed XYZ seems to go quite well with this mouthpiece. Vandoren do! So
why not?

 

What you are talking about is good, but may need changing depending upon the
way the video is structured.

 

I mostly agree with what John say&#39;s below here. BUT perhaps WWBW have more
staff to be able to track and deal with customer issues than you do. Perhaps
a compromise between you current standing and WWBW?? There is always some
so-and-so trying to get one over on a retailer. Unfortunately its human
nature, so they spoil it for the rest of us.

 

Hope this is useful

            <pre class='message__body'>It had been my hope when I started this discussion to get some feedback on a
possible format that discussed information that I felt was missing from most
mouthpiece ads, such as baffle, chamber size, facing length and other
product specifications. This information is almost never disclosed. I had
tried to be clear about the fact that the videos we put up as examples of
what we planned to do were "quick and dirty", and my intent was to show the
format and get some feedback on what additional information might be
required or might be of interest to potential buyers. Maybe I am the only
one who understands the concept of "quick and dirty", and for that I
apologize. I did not intend for this to evolve into a discussion of camera
techniques, as I am well aware of the visual shortcomings of what we
presented. I was looking for comments on content, not technique, and I
believe I may have failed to make that clear.

 

Insofar as the discussion of our return policy, I am delighted that some of
you found it so easily. It&#39;s always been right there, fully disclosed, with
no "fine print" or attempt at concealment. If you don&#39;t agree or like it,
take your business elsewhere says I. We tell you our terms right up front,
and I fail to see the problem.

 

I find it incredibly amusing that some of you suggest that I adopt the
policies of WWBW. I note with interest that WWBW recently emerged from
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding and have significantly reduced the size of
their operations. The left hundreds of creditors unpaid, having not millions
but TENS of millions in unpaid bills. This is hardly the way we want to go
with our company, so thank you very much for your suggestion, but we&#39;ll
continue what we&#39;re currently doing and hope to stay in business for the
future. Our competitors are certainly free to adopt any policies they see
fit. We note that liberal policies are often suggested when someone else&#39;s
(mine!) money is involved, and will monitor our sales and take appropriate
action should they fail to continue to grow at the current rate.

 

I know that not everyone agrees with our return policy. So be it. We don&#39;t
force anyone to buy from us, and currently are selling mouthpieces (and
necks, accessories, and saxophones) at a rate which pretty much equals our
limited production capacity. We think our customers prefer low prices to
policies which increase our costs, and will continue down this path until we
are proven wrong.

 

I sincerely appreciate the comments, and have considered them all. I am
still anxious to hear your suggestions, particularly about technical
content.

 

Today is Mardi Gras Day in New Orleans. I know it&#39;s "just another Tuesday"
everywhere else, but I have a house full of guests and much partying to do,
so I may not be available to this discussion during the day today. Laissez
Bon Temps Roule&#39;!!

- Don&#39;t let the LED of the camera or any image reflect in the mouthpiece.

- Make the camera steady. I understand you are using a "flip cam". Even when
your using a flip cam don&#39;t let it have jerking movement when you pan left
or right, for example your  Musicmedic mouthpiece facing clinic video,
fantastic content, but only average camera work. I&#39;m sorry to say that the
camera work let you down. Also you should have had a radio mic.

- Maybe suggest a preferred reed. Or say that the feedback from  people is
that reed XYZ seems to go quite well with this mouthpiece. Vandoren do! So
why not?

 

What you are talking about is good, but may need changing depending upon the
way the video is structured.

 

I mostly agree with what John say&#39;s below here. BUT perhaps WWBW have more
staff to be able to track and deal with customer issues than you do. Perhaps
a compromise between you current standing and WWBW?? There is always some
so-and-so trying to get one over on a retailer. Unfortunately its human
nature, so they spoil it for the rest of us.

 

Hope this is useful

The Nation of Music ebay site says:

"Will usually ship within 3 business days of receiving cleared payment"

The store&#39;s return policy states:

"All returns must be RECEIVED by us within three days of delivery to you
with NO exceptions".

USPS priority mail takes 2 to 3 days to ship depending on the time the
package is posted. That means a customer must try the mouthpiece and
ship by return mail the same day it arrives otherwise it will not get
back to you within the 3 days and will not be accepted. There is also a
$20 or $25 cleaning and sterilization fee charged for any mouthpiece
returned.

By comparison, WWBW sells many top quality mouthpieces in an assortment
of tip openings for low prices and allows a 45 day return privilege. 
Mouthpieces under $300 are acessed a $4.00 cleaning and sterilization
fee, those over $300 and $8.00 fee. If you exchange for another
mouthpiece, they will even pay your return shipping.

It is possible to rationalize that customers must not have a problem
with these restrictive sales policies since a lot of merchandise is
sold. However, it raises the question of how many more potential sales
are lost because of the number of people who are turned away by the low
regard for customer satisfaction these overly restrictive policies
suggest.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve,

I apologize that I misunderstood that it was a "Quick and dirty" video with the primary focus on content.

In regard to content, my personal amateur opinion, is that is OK as it is. However would the average punter understand most of terms that you refer to in the video. 

I do understand that you want to educate, but does the average punter want to learn? 

A lot of questions on forums that I have read are of the type: "What mouthpiece do I buy so that I can sound like 
Coltrane?"

What is the target market? Beginner? Intermediate? Pro?? What is the largest target market for sales? 
I would suspect that these questions would determine the level of technical content and the manner in which you tie technical and educational content together.

May I suggest another short video that explains the different elements of the Mouthpiece. That way you could also include that link as well should the punter need further explanation.

A)  If (rhetorical) you are looking to maximize you market opportunity, hire
a professional to assist you in presenting your product with the level of
esteem you feel it deserves.  There are people that specialize in marketing
and their services, for the money, are worth the time you could be spending
focused on your center of expertise.

B)  Subjective statements and hyperbole aside, your technical content is
just enough to capture the attention of someone who might be interested in
hearing it.  Adding more technical content (or attempting to appeal to
others who might be further enticed by additional technical content) is
pointless without addressing A) above.

I agree with you that there is way to much “what mouthpiece/horn do I buy to sound just like (fill in the blank)…..I’m not real sure that the people who are asking this question would listen if you explained the differences in mouthpieces with regard to expected performance………..the vast majority of our customers are adult hobby players (guys with day jobs), and most of them really seem to know very little about equipment…….hopefully, the next commercial DVD we offer (an edit and expansion of the mouthpiece clinic I gave recently at the Saxophone Smackdown) will reduce the “knowledge gap”……..we currently have a fair amount of material up (and free for the taking) at our www.saxgourmet.com site……I think there’s also a lot of excellent material available all over the internet (I’m particularly fond of Theo Wanne’s site) so if they don’t want to make the effort to educate themselves I am not really sure how to motivate them. Musicians (particularly amateur musicians) are pretty difficult customers, who often believe a lot of mythology and have very unreasonable expectations. As consumers, they often believe that a special set of rules (just for musicians) apply to them……we’re looking for ways to anticipate questions and provide more information so the buyers can make informed decisions…….I wish everybody who sells mouthpieces would do this. It amazes me how little information the vast majority of mouthpiece manufacturers provide consumers. Get a music magazine or surf the net and look at the mouthpiece ads. There is usually just a picture of the exterior and some vague claims…..rarely anything specific about the design or construction……….yet musicians accept this, which is a mystery me. It’s also troubling to me that with the advent of the internet, suddenly a lot of people have popped up out of nowhere who claim to be experts, yet if you look at their personal history and track record they have really accomplished nothing in the industry. These self-appointed experts espouse all sorts of bogus opinions and bad information, but their lack of actual experience never stops them from talking about things with which they have no real personal experience or background. That’s why we put a blurb about my background and experience on the sample eBay listing. We want people to know we didn’t just pop up a couple of years ago, but have been doing this for a long time. Everybody should do this, IMHO. I think we all need to know just how thin the resume of some of the “experts” who post frequently on the web really is.

If you do not want to post comparison to to Selmer facings (as close to a standard that most teachers and directors will understand), how about a link to thr charts at
http://www.saxgourmet.com/mpfacing.html

There they can see how big, 90 105 and 120 tip openings really are before they buy.

If you want them better educated, how about Paul&#39;s articles on your saxgourmet site?

 http://www.saxgourmet.com/PaulCoatsArticles/mouthpiece_sizes.htm
http://www.saxgourmet.com/PaulCoatsArticles/mouthpiece_facings.htm

Where do they specify which tip opening they want? On check out?

Just for comparison, this is the fine print info, including my/our return policy. I think your "All returns must be RECIEVED by us within three business days." would take UPS Blue from here, or some similar shiping from Fed Ex. The postal service cannot be counted on to do it.

Here is our policy. It could be worded better, but it has worked well so far.

 "USA Bidders only. PayPal is preferred and we will ship to a confirmed address only.  We also accept cashier&#39;s checks or money orders. No personal checks. Cash is accepted with an in-person pick up. Shipping to the lower 48 will be a flat $XXX for UPS ground, and will include padding in a sturdy box and insurance.  AK and HI shipping will be higher, but not a problem. We&#39;re sorry about the shipping cost, but UPS is not cheap, and we pack instruments etc. well.

Our return policy is if we have substantially misrepresented the instrument, we will refund the selling price, but not S/H/I, once the instrument is safely returned in the same condition as it was sent. This does not cover buyer&#39;s remorse or a trial period. We are honest musicians and repair shop owners who strive to be accurate in our descriptions.

On the off chance UPS damages this item in shipping, we will assist in filing the claim. You must save the packing along with the item in case they request an inspection.

Please do not ask for us to end the auction early. That&#39;s not playing fair, and could be against Ebay&#39;s policy."
