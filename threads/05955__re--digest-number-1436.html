    Does anyone know if La Voz is still, or could be talked into, making
    aluminum ReedGards? Who makes them and/or who is the major
    distributor of the ReedGards?

    Thank you,

    David

    I doubt it. The plastic ones seem to work as well for me and are a lot
    less expensive for them to make. I sold several of my Aluminum ones a few
    years ago on eBay. I still kept one size for each sax/clar.

    I was talking to someone, I can&#39;t remember who, about reeds and mildew & hes suggested that he used the aluminum ReedGard and NEVER had any mildew form. I use the plastic ones & my reeds get mildewed. Any ideas?

    Thank you,

    David

    In fact, I think the plastic ones are much better. The grooves promote faster drying, and the plastic part that holds the reed down does not bend and lose pressure like the aluminum ones. I am quite sure that Rico Internatinal finds them far and away cheaper to manufacture, too. I still have a couple. For saxes, I usually use the metal holders for reeds for metal mouthpieces, just to help keep things straight. The plastic ones are easier to clean, too. I throw them in the diswasher.

    Thanks Willis, this is great stuff. I will have to see about getting the software setup. I have Excel but not the add-in problem solver. The instructions are well written, heck, even I can understand them , I think. Nice job.

    Take a look at the file Facing Schedule.zip in the Methods folder in 
    the Files area. You do not need Excel to generate schedules for 
    radial curves. The spreadsheet works with OpenOffice Calc and 
    Gnumeric, both free. I also include a procedure to generate an 
    accurate curve without the Solver add-in. All you need is the facing 
    length and the tip opening and you can generate a radial curve target 
    schedule.

    For a bari, I usually use either a 27mm or 28mm (0.0015" feeler) 
    facing length. If you are using a .110" opening on a tenor, you most 
    likely would be comfortable with something in that range in a bari 
    and probably a little more open. Going from something with a 0.080" 
    opening to 0.110" would be a bit of a stretch, but as was mentioned 
    here, it depends on how much material you have at the tip before it 
    gets too thin and sharp.

    Rico Royal Graftonite mouthpieces are kind of fun to experiment with--
    and cheap. My favorite mouthpiece was a Yamaha 5C on my vintage 1923 
    Buescher bari--until I hogged out a Graftonite mouthpiece. It took a 
    while, but I took out the high baffle and hogged out the sides. Not 
    quite a vintage pickle mouthpiece, but it has a pretty big chamber 
    now.

    Good luck with modifying your bari mouthpiece.

    Willis
