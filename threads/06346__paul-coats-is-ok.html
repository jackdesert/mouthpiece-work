  I heard from Paul this morning. He lost some trees, has no electricity, etc.
 but he and his family are OK. He lives in Morgan City, which took the 
worst
hit from Gustav.

            <pre class='message__body'>Rather than type the whole thing over and over, I am pasting this below...
   
  I am at a friend&#39;s house that we are watching for them while they are away.  It is 5 blocks from our house, and they just now got power back on.  I&#39;m basking in the air conditioning.... ahhhhhh!!!! 
   
  I just found out our ISP is up and running, too.
   
  So, things are slowly coming back.
   
  The "eye" of the hurricane passed directly over us.  It was strange, high winds (70-90 mph) coming from the northeast, then almost suddenly still.  The rain fell to a soft drizzle, then after a few minutes quit.  We, and all the people up and down the street, took that opportunitity to clear debris from the storm drains along the edge of the street.  We live on a intersection, so we had four corners, each with a drain on both sides.  Water was up over the curbs, but as soon as we pulled a little of the leaves and limbs out it started moving, and whooshed into a little whirpool.  In 15-20 minutes the streets were completely drained.  
   
  About 30 minutes later, altogether the still of the eye was about 50 min - 1 hr.  Anyway, 30 min later the wind started from the opposite direction, coming from the SW.  It was not quite as strong, but still bad.
   
  We had NO roof damage.  We had the roof reshingled last year with the top quality "30 year" shingles.  We had the windows covered with plywood.  Of course, this was already precut, marked as to which window each piece fit, we had used it in previous storms.  We had a large birch tree, about 15" dia trunk, break about 8&#39; up.  But it did not hit anyone&#39;s house or anything else.  
   
  Lots of big limbs and leaves in the yard, but nothing more serious.
   
  Worse was no power.  It got hot and sticky quickly.  We had ice chests, ice, etc, ate perishables first.  Grilled chicken, other meats as they began to thaw.  We picked up more ice, water, and military MRE&#39;s (Meals, Ready To Eat) but will consume our food first.  Well, we cleaned out the fridge and freezer, got that carried off and tossed in the nearby school&#39;s dumpster where it can stink over there.  Hah!
   
  There are only a few stores open, running rental generators.
   
  My youngest daughter is at LSU (Louisiana State University) and is a certified EMT (Emergency Medical Technician), in other words, can work for ambulance services.  She volunteered for a "special needs" shelter (elderly, handicapped, ) set up at the university.  It turns out that she has met many people from our area that she knew.  I&#39;m sure that just seeing a familiar smiling face is comforting to a lot of the people in the shelter.  She met the Louisiana governor, Gov. Bobby Jindal, and got a photo taken for the paper, interviewed for TV.  Hah!  She may be in USA Today.  Her 15 seconds of fame.
   
  Anyway, we are all just fine, My house and outbuildings (storeroom, workshop) are in good condition, no damage whatsoever.  Just waiting for electricty to come back on.  We do have water, and sewerage is working, that is, the toilets flush.  The water heater is natural gas, so we even have hot for showers/baths.
   
  Peggy says the cell phones have just switched from Roming to our regular service.
   
  Thanks for asking... we will be fine.  And thanks for all the calls, offers of a place to stay.  That is really much appreciated.  Just knowing we have those kinds of friends is a great boost.
   
  Paul
