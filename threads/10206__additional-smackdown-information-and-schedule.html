below)


Please read and understand the: Cancellation Policy


After the good people at MusicMedic.com put on the first Saxophone  
Smackdown in 2010, we wondered how they could possibly top free food,  
live music, clinicians from around the country, not to mention the  
fabulous MusicMedic.com coffee (and other beverages we heard so much  
about!). Looking at this year&#39;s itinerary, however, it appears that  
2012&#39;s Smackdown will not only top the first event, but it&#39;s going to  
blow it out of the water!

Now, in 2012, NAPBIRT and MusicMedic.com join forces to bring a full  
weekend of champions to Wilmington, North Carolina, USA. The Saxophone  
Smackdown II promises twice the Sax-O-Mania: 2 bands, 2 breakfasts, 2  
lunches, clinicians from around the world, and a tour of the  
MusicMedic Coliseum. All of the clinicians will be staying both days,  
and some clinicians will be practicing their craft throughout the  
weekend LIVE at the Smackdown. There&#39;s never been an event like this  
in saxophone history; it can only be described as RAW!!!!!

This year&#39;s Smackdown is a day and night action-packed event. In the  
dark days of low quality instrument clones infiltrating the market and  
the repair shop, there are 6 masters of their craft who are joining  
forces to settle the score. The rumble will be heard around the world  
as Jerry Chang, Jason DuMars, Theo Wanne, Jerome Selmer, Steve Goodson  
and Curt Altarac make their way into the MusicMedic.com Coliseum. The  
surge of masterful makers converging on one place for the sake of  
sharing knowledge and ideas will undoubtedly lead to the victory of  
craftsmanship.


CLINICS & CLINICIANS


Theo Wanne

There can be lots of masters, but there can only be one reigning  
champion. We searched far and wide for the best mouthpiece maker in  
the world. If you&#39;ve never met Theo Wanne or experienced his space-age  
machine shop or played one of his outrageous mouthpieces, crawl out  
from under that rock and get over here to the Smackdown!

Having refaced mouthpieces for great players on nearly every  
continent, Theo then set his sights on creating custom mouthpieces  
based on his wealth of knowledge and research. The results are highly  
sought-after saxophone mouthpieces for all types of players.

In this clinic, Theo will share from his years of research and  
development in both refacing mouthpieces for the finest players and  
making mouthpieces of the highest caliber, precision and consistency.  
Bring lots of questions, because there&#39;s nothing about the mouthpiece  
that Theo doesn&#39;t know, and bring your mouthpieces because Theo will  
be here for both days of the event and is offering his services right  
there at the Smackdown! Learn the secrets, then watch as these  
techniques are implemented right before your eyes.


Jerry Chang

When you hear stories about Asian-made musical instruments improving  
and even surpassing those made in other parts of the world, you&#39;re  
hearing stories about Jerry Chang. If you&#39;ve ever been taken aback by  
the way a reasonably priced student instrument plays, you&#39;re  
experiencing the work of Jerry Chang. With factories in several  
countries, a huge work force, and years of successful production, Mr.  
Chang and his company, Tenon, are world leaders in instrument  
manufacture. Combining old world craftsmanship with modern tooling,  
Jerry has redefined the nature of excellent yet affordable saxophones.

Flying all the way from Taiwan to share from his insights, Mr. Chang  
will be at the Smackdown both days and will be attending the panel- 
style supper both nights, should you want to meet and speak with him.

With two huge factories at his disposal, sit back and relax as Jerry  
walks you through his expansive saxophone factory with a virtual tour.  
You&#39;ll find out what makes Mr. Chang&#39;s instruments different from  
other imported Asian saxophones and he&#39;ll be discussing specific  
techniques in instrument manufacture. We won&#39;t all be lucky enough in  
our lifetimes to visit one of Jerry&#39;s giant instrument manufacturing  
facilities, but we can all come to the Smackdown and enjoy a factory  
tour given by the man who makes it all happen.


Jason DuMars It&#39;s lucky for us that the most creative and artistic  
engraver of our time is also a saxophonist. Renowned for the  
appearance of what are now the most beautiful saxophones on the  
planet, Jason&#39;s company, DuMars Engraving, is the go-to place for  
taking engraving to another level. In a world where CNC machines build  
instruments and lasers engrave them, Jason DuMars sits quietly with a  
sharpened graver and a saxophone, creating timeless works of art.

Clinic attendees will learn about the tools of the engraving trade and  
see the master himself in action. Jason will explain the basics of the  
art of engraving, including different types of engraving tools and  
cuts. He&#39;ll talk about creating totally new designs, adding onto  
existing engravings, and restoring vintage engravings. Jason will be  
at the Smackdown both days and offering his services, so bring a horn  
that you want engraved (let us know you&#39;re bringing it in advance), or  
just watch how his engraving projects progress over the course of the  
two-day smackdown.


Jerome Selmer

Of course Jerome Selmer&#39;s factory in France leads the saxophone world,  
and the Selmer name has forever changed the course of the saxophone&#39;s  
evolution. But looking into the future, this stalwart of quality  
musical instruments is constantly striving to make improvements to the  
instrument and the business. Learn about what it takes to operate,  
maintain, and grow the tradition begun by Henri Selmer in 1885.

Every great saxophonist owns or has owned a Selmer, be it a Super  
Balanced Action, Mark VI, Serie II, Reference 54; players have found  
their “sound” in Selmer Saxophones. If you work on Pro horns, you work  
on Selmers. If you play Pro horns, you play or have played a Selmer.  
Jerome Selmer is the one man that knows more about the design and  
manufacture of Selmer saxophones than anyone else alive.

In this clinic, Mr. Selmer will talk about many aspects of Selmer  
saxophone design and manufacture that have changed throughout the  
years, including differences between Selmer&#39;s current saxophone line.  
After this clinic, the next time you&#39;re asked about the difference  
between a Selmer Reference and a Series III, or a MKVI, you can answer  
with confidence as you will have gotten that information, and much  
more, directly from Jerome Selmer himself.


No major wrestling event would be complete without the seasoned pros  
and ringside announcers. Rest assured that you will be well fed with  
plenty of good drinks and conversation with Curt Altarac and Steve  
Goodson ushering you through this event!
