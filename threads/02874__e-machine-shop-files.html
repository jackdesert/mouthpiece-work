            <pre class='message__body'>Well, I guess that answers that question.  I was just getting ready to
ask if you would send me the model.  I am a very advanced SolidWorks

Keith, I am only on this message after starting at the beginning and

blanks at any time?

            <pre class='message__body'>There is a chance.  But eMachineShop really struggled to supply the blanks
I designed via their software.  On a private follow-up project they raised
their prices ~2X and then just rejected the effort after I submitted a
design.  They had trouble with lower baffles, tip and tip rail shapes, and
thin walls at the base of the window "U".  

I have done some design work using AutoDesk Inventor.  This is still quite
involved but at least the software has enough 3D functions to make the
geometry you want.  There are machine shops that can quote parts from the
3D CAD files.  But we would need to order on the order of 100 brass blanks
of the same design to get a price of about $100 each.  

It is cheaper to buy Asian-made metal mouthpieces off eBay for blanks.
