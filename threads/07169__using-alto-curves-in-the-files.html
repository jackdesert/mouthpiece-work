You just type in your feeler sizes the same way.  These files assume you have a working knowledge of using spreadsheets.  If not, it would help to find someone local to you who does know how to use MS Excel for a few lessons.  Once you get started, you can learn from the Excel help files.

How can I use the spreadsheet in the alto curves spreadsheet. I can put different values in for radius and start but how do I put in different feeler guage values? thanks John
