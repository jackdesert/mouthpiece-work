  I wrote back on 9/14/04: I think the quotes are reasonable. Two CNC 
  made blanks will cost
  $105 each. 5 will be $51 each. 10 = $31 and 20 = $21. These are
  brass blanks. You can get 10 non-CNC clear Acrylic blanks for $17
  each.

  Interest has been:

  &lt;rbooth@...>  2-3 tenors

  douglas neale &lt;dugsax@...>  1?

  "sjrosner" &lt;sjrosner@...>  a few

  "mikeruhl" &lt;meruhl@...>  2-3

  dan lunsford &lt;bluesnote2000@...> some

  &lt;peterhepplewhite@...>  2

  MojoBari 2-3

  So it looks like we have interest in 12-17.  To get down to $21 each 
  for a brass blank, we need to order 20.  s/h will be a few bucks 
  too.  I can get a quote for any number.  15 will be somewhere between 
  $21 and $31 each. Probably $24-25 which is not too bad.

  Also, I can alter the design a little, but not much without a lot of 
  grief.  I was think of duckbilling it more gradually.  But the deck 
  still is limited to being flat across the piece.

            <pre class='message__body'>You guys surprised me!  We are in the 33-38 range now and the price 
will be below $20 each + s/h.

I&#39;m thinking of leaving the beak flat since it will be easier for any 
of us who may want to glue on a tooth deck for comfort.

Also, be aware that there is some risk involved here.  The tolerances 
are in the .003"-.005" range at these prices.  I&#39;ll explore how much 
the price goes up for tighter tolerances, but the first priority is 
to keep the cost down.

Also, the surface finish may not be great.  This means more hand 
finishing.  I&#39;ll read the fine print and see what we are in for.

If I can tighten the specs and keep us around $20 each I&#39;ll do it.

            <pre class='message__body'>FYI, I got the idea to design a tooth deck insert made of some kind 
of plastic that would glue right on the deck.  The bad news is the 
cost was ~$10 each.   A more frugal solution would be for me to 
supply a 1/8" thick patch of black plastic with the piece for this 
purpose.  Cost would be about $.30 each.  

I was thinking of Delrin, but it may be tough to glue in place.  
Anyone up on safe platics to consider.  I was going to by a strip 
from McMaster-Carr and divvy it up.  A lot of what they have is white 
or clear.  I would prefer black.

Another step we will need to deal with is plating.  I could get the 
blanks plated with Silver or Nickle for ~$1.75 if it is done before 
delivery.  But they will get messed up as the pieces are finished by 
us.  So I do not think this is worth the $.

I&#39;m probably going to get them buffed to a mirror finish. This will 
round the sharp edges slightly and may save us all some exterior 
work.  This only cost a few cents, so we are still looking at $20 or 
less plus s/h.

I&#39;ll probably place the order within the next week or two.  Then it 
would be 3-4 weeks delivery.  I may try one more time to get an 
initial reed shape on the tip.  But the software may not allow me to 
do it.

Keith,
Have you ever considered just making the piece flat brass and always 
using a tooth patch (I use the Vandorens)...Sometimes I wonder if 
these inserts are worth all the trouble. Just as a point of interest, 
how many of us always use a toothpatch?

            <pre class='message__body'>Perhaps we can all mail to Keith after we finish our work, and Keith 
have them plated (let me suggest nickel rather than chrome).  For teeth 
insert, why not simply use a clear stick on patch?  These are rather 
thin but do not cut through easily.  For me they last for years.  The 
only reason I remove them is to clean crud around the edge, scrub well, 
then replace with a new one.  Cheap and easy.

            <pre class='message__body'>I always use a thin clear mylar patch.  It is not thick and spongy like 
the black rubber patches, but is not hard like the plastic or hard 
rubber beak.  Gives me a little bit of grip.  And they seem to last a 
very long while, unlike the rubber patches.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ll raise the deck a little.  It still needs to be flat as per a
limitation in the eMachineShop system.  One could use 1-2 patches or a
deck.  I&#39;m leaning towards a deck since it will be easier to contour the
top of it for comfort that reworking the brass deck.

I tried but I can not get the tip the way I wanted.  I was able to curve
some of the other corners.  I&#39;ll post some new pics Sunday.  Look for the
Brass color on a Blue background.

Keith,
When you say &#39;a deck&#39; are you thinking like the old Brillhart pieces 
with a large plastic/rubber piece on the top of the beak that gets 
shaped, rather than shaping the brass?

the latest design is high enough I think a tooth patch may be all that is
needed.  

Another advantage to the current design is that there is more room to lower
the baffle if desired.  The blanks will come with a fairly high baffle. 
The software will not allow me to angle it to lower it some.  I can machine
steps and grooves in it, but they add to the cost and limit options
available to whomever is finishing the piece.

One last thing I need to fix is the width of the window and outside rails
near the tip.  They are a bit too wide for a tenor reed as they are.  After
I tweek the design for this, I think it will be ready to place an order.

I just added photos of the "Mojo23" mouthpiece blank to the Photos - 
CAD section.  I&#39;ll do a few more checks on the reed fit but I think 
this one is "it".  

The window length is 1/4" shorter and is more typical of tenor MPs 
now.  I added a small second bullet-like relief in the throat.  Looks 
kinda cool but the main purpose is to mark where I think the baffle 
should ramp down to from the tip.  I plan to hand file mine down to 
that level (its another .100" down).

FYI the inside is tapered by 1 deg on the sides.  The outside is 2 
degs.  The tip opening should be about .095", but this needs to be 
finished by hand to create a tip rail to match a reed curve.

I do not have a plating source established.  We&#39;ll have to share 
experiances here down the road.

I&#39;m sure I have 20-30 hours of learning curve and design time into 
this thing.  Most of it was fun.

I placed an order! Delivery should be around 11/8/04.  The shop is in 
northern NJ, so s/h is not bad to me.  However, I need to pay in-

If all goes well, price should be $20 each.  I should be able to do 
s/h for $5 in the US and $7 international per order.  This covers 
packaging and offsets other costs I will incur.

Payment may be made by check, MO to

or Paypal to MojoMouthpieceWork@...

Those who expressed interest get first crack at the quantities they

I asked for two tenor blanks.  Should I send a check
now? (Shipping would be to zip code 37921, Knoxville,
Tennessee).  Would it be better to wait until they
come in?  Either way is cool.

Sweet! I will send a check out for you.  By the way,
what was decided on the bite plate, and will the
blanks actually play as recieved?  Either way is fine,
jst forgot to ask and also;do these have a round, or
romboid shape.  I will also provide my shipping
address.

There are pictures on the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site under the CAD 
folder.  Look at the Mojo23 design.  I actually submitted a Mojo25 
design but the differences were subtle.

The beak is higher than the original design pictures.  There will be 
no bite plate supplied.

The blanks may play, but I doubt it.  Here are the areas I think will 
need rework:

1. The tip rail.  Needs to be filed to match the curve of a reed.  
Needs to be defined from the inside.

2. The baffle.  It is too high.  It should be filed down at 
least .100" where it goes into the throat.  But you can do this in 
stages and experiment.  The higher beak allows you to make a low 
baffle MP if you wish.

3. The Beak.  I think the top is too flat for comfort.  The corners 
may dig into your upper lip.  If so, just file a more comfortable 
shape using other MPs as a guide.  If you have the means, you can 
even machine in a bite plate recess or dovetail and make a bite plate 
to fit.  But a simple mouthpiece patch is all you really need.

4. The facing.  There will be a 5" radius facing curve on it open to 
about .095" or so at the tip.  I doubt this facing curve will be very 
good.  It will need to be hand finished.  This will effect the tip 
rail and baffle too.

5. The side rails should be wider than the reed near the tip.  They 
should be narrowed down some from the outside to match the width of 
standard reeds.

Lastly, the shop tolerances are in the .003"-.005" range.  If they 
use a lot of this range, or exceed it, the blank may look crooked or 
not symmetrical.  This is the big unknown until they arrive in early 
November.
