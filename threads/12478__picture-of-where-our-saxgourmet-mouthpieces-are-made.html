            <pre class='message__body'>Our mouthpieces are made to our specification at EMR Machine in Phoenix, Arizona using state of the art CNC machines operated by master machinists ……. here’s a shot of the actual machines used……EMR Machine manufactures many of our other saxophone products for us and has done so for many years. They are masters at converting my original designs into actual products used by saxophonists all over the world.
