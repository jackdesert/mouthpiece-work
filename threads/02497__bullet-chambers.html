will a bullet chamber along with a slight biuld up of the mpc floor 
make a minor or major difference on a stm ny link? what about the 
size of the bullet,is there a standard? widening and adding length 
to the window help increase the effects of the bullet.

it.  What might be minor to one player is major to another.

            <pre class='message__body'>AFAIK widening or lengthening the window really only has the effect of increasing the interior dimensions at that point, since the reed seals the window until the rail break (or should anyway). So it would have some effect, depending on how thick that mpc is under the table, but it would be somewhat analogous to taking some material off the back of the baffle at that point.

  it.  What might be minor to one player is major to another.

  In my opinion, no.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree with Toby.  There may also be a slight difference in how the sound
reflects off the "wall" at the base of the window "U".  But no real
interaction with the bullet shape.
