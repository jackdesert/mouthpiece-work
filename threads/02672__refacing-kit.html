Hello,
I am in the process of writing a booklet to go with the kit.  I am 
also glad to correspond with anyone regarding my knowledge of 
refacing.  I don´t keep any secrets and believe that work on the 
mouthpieces is something that anyone can learn and everyone should 
try.  As I said, I only deal with clarinet mouthpieces.  I have made 
sax mouthpieces for myself, but think that others in this group can 
serve you better with saxophone questions.  I am in Spain right now 
rehearsing and performing a concerto, but once I am back home, I´ll 
be glad to take calls or emails from anyone.  Thanks for your 
inquiries. 

Ben

            <pre class='message__body'>Ben,
 
I am very interested in your kit.  Please remember me when the kit  becomes 
available.  I want to get into refacing clarinet mouthpieces.
