We often think of refacing as being necessary to fix the flaws found 
in mass produced mouthpieces. This has certainly been the case for me 
too, but I&#39;ve found just as often lately that I&#39;m working on pieces 
by independent makers...and correcting some of the same flaws. Uneven 
rails, bad curves, tip openings that are way off spec. Makes me think 
maybe I should start my own mouthpiece line.

Nah...not yet.

LOL

BTW, I&#39;m working on repairing a Berg bari shank this week. I&#39;ll post 
some stuff about the method - once I ascertain that it&#39;s actually 
worked the way I hoped.

I think any good refacer has particular things they like to see made 
right.  Others think they get good enough results without achieving 
the same goals.  Some have good/bad days.  I think they can run out 
of patience after a certain number of hours on a piece.  I 
occassionally do.

I have seen very few pieces that I would not touch anything on them.  
It makes me wonder about a couple of things.  One, are my gauges 
accurate?  Were the other refacer&#39;s?  We both may be trying to get to 
the same targets, but measure it slightly different.  The other thing 
I wonder is if other refacers are finding things to change in my 
pieces.  Not just due to gauging differences, but differences in 
targets/goals/strategies.  What are their results?

I&#39;ve seen a few that are returned to me for fixing.  But these 
typically come with a letter saying they were drunk when they were 
doing the work...

            <pre class='message__body'>Reading about refcing work this morning prompted me to write from the other end..as someone who has had work done. I recently purchased a mouthpiece sight unseen, so of course you take your chances. However, since it wasfrom a reputable maker I thought that I would be reasonable safe. When the mouthpiece arrived it was a disaster...uneven rails no suction...and that is just what I could see as a player not a refacer...of course it did not play worth a damn. Fortunately, I had recently met a person (Merlin Williams)doing refacing and in fact he had restored a vintage slant signature for me, l will admit at this point that I really was not too sure about this whole thing and had never seen any of his work but with the Link being a write-off (someone  long ago botched a refacing job on it) I had nothing to lose. Wow!, what a pleasant surprise the Link now plays great (very much like my New York Meyer). Anyway, after that experience I had non problem trusting Merlin with the soprano
 mouthpiece that I recently purchased. Needless to say, he did an outstanding job, it is now a killer piece (in fact, the other night I was told that the soprano was overpowering the sax section in a soli passage with a big band) I am not accustomed to haveing such a great blowing soprano piece so I could easily back off a bit. 
I contacted the maker and told him this story. He apologized and acknowledged the fact that we all have bad days and this one must have slipped by him which I am sure is true as he has a very good reputation.
Anyway, I just wanted to say to all mouthpiece refacers keep up the good work adn a very special thank you to Merlin Williams.
