            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all!  My name is Craig Christman and I am professional musician and repair technician 
in South Florida.  I&#39;m looking forward to learning more about mouthpiece work and I wish I 
had more knowledge to share with the group!  Hopefully I can share other knowledge about 
repair issues and doubling (I play sax, flute, clarinet, and bassoon), so hopefully that will 
make up for my lack of knowledge about mouthpiece work (but hey, that&#39;s why I joined this 
forum!)  Anyway, I&#39;m looking forward to future discussions.  Thanks for this forum.

Hello all! My name is Craig Christman and I am professional musician and repair
technician

I wish I

about 
repair issues and doubling (I play sax, flute, clarinet, and bassoon), so hopefully
that will 
make up for my lack of knowledge about mouthpiece work (but hey, that&#39;s why I joined
