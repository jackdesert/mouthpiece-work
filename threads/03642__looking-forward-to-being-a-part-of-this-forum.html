Looking forward to being a part of this forum! 
Hello all! My name is Craig Christman and I am professional musician and repair
technician 
in South Florida. I&#39;m looking forward to learning more about mouthpiece work and
I wish I 
had more knowledge to share with the group! Hopefully I can share other knowledge
about 
repair issues and doubling (I play sax, flute, clarinet, and bassoon), so hopefully
that will 
make up for my lack of knowledge about mouthpiece work (but hey, that&#39;s why I joined
this 
forum!) Anyway, I&#39;m looking forward to future discussions. Thanks for this forum.

Craig
