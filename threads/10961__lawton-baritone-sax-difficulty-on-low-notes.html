            <pre class='message__body'>Dear friends and expert of the MouthpieceWork Group,

I´m glad that you accepted me in the group because here in Brazil we don´t have many information about refacing ,adjusting , restoring mouthpieces. I´m beginning in this world ,but as I´m a sax player I can check the mistakes   and also the hits I make on real time.
I´ve done 2 decent refaces on my professor´s Otto Link. His Early babbit otto Link tone Master was with no sound , and now he doesn´t sleep anymore , he  just can´t stop playing on it.
 But now , I have a problem , another friend of mine has a Baritone  Lawton  7 . It plays well on all the range , with pretty sound,excepts for the low notes, below the D, the sound gets hard to blow. The sax is playing well, with my otto Link & ,the problem disappear. The sax is a Mark VI (no low A).
The mouthpiece haas some marks and maybe someone worked on it... I couldn´t take a precise measure of the facing yet , but it seems to be with 55 mm on the 0.0015" feeler. Could this be the problem with low notes? I always heard that a long facing is good for the low notes...

I would appreciate any comments,.advice and help that you could give me.

Your Best

Esteban Pascual

I forgot to say I was using the E. Brand scale . The facing has 28mm, should this make the low notes dificult to play?
Thanks again

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree that&#39;s pretty long.  It&#39;s also not likely to be the source of your low note problem.

The length, though -- is it consistent?  Make sure the table is genuinely flat.  If it&#39;s not, it could read as a long facing and cause the problems you&#39;re experiencing.  Check to see if the gauge reading changes depending on where you hold the glass gauge on the mouthpiece.  Also lay it on something flat and look to see if light escapes anywhere under the table.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think you won&#39;t be able to tell what might be causing this until you measure the facing.  Maybe the table isn&#39;t flat, maybe the facing has some problems, but you won&#39;t be able to make a plan until you know.

I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late to the party...

The E. Brand scale is in 1/2 mm&#39;s.  That is, a reading of 56 (half mm&#39;s) on an E. Brand type glass gauge, such as the ones I get from J. J. Babbit, would read 56 with the .0015" feeler, and have an actual length of 28 mm.

My Winslow glass gauge, no longer made, would indicated 28, as it is marked in full mm&#39;s.

I typically face baritone saxophone mouthpieces around 26 mm (52 on E. Brand).  A facing length of 28 mm (56 on E. Brand) would not be too long for the low end.

I think the problem is more likely a leak, not mouthpiece related.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think your problem is most likely elsewhere…..if you are using a 28mm facing, you would need to reprofile the reed to make it work properly…..there are no out of the box reeds with that kind of profile
