            <pre class='message__body'>I have a newer 7* around I could measure up.  I played on it for a year. 
It was a lot of fun.

The main old/new difference I&#39;ve noticed was that it looks like less hard
rubber is in the newer ones.  They look more like polished plastic.  The
old ones like purer hard rubber.  The fit of the sliding baffle was a
little sloppy and off-centered in my newer one.  I doubt they are all like
that.  Some report differences in the mechanism or leaks, but I have not
seen either.  I&#39;ve only seen a few though.
