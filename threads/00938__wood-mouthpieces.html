From the Berlioz article of June 12, 1842

"If for any reason a clarinet were to remain for a few days without
being
played, or was in use for too long a time, dryness or humidity rendered
the wooden mouthpiece difficult to use. Mr. Sax, by giving the
instrument
a gilt mouthpiece that increases the brilliancy of its sound, has done
away with these inconveniences. The metallic mouthpiece is not subject
to
change like the wooden one. "

Well, for those wondering why wood was abandoned for mouthpieces!
