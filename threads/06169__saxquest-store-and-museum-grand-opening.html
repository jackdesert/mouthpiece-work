Here&#39;s an announcement from my friends at Saxquest which I thought would be
of general interest.
Mark Overton, the owner of Saxquest, has a fabulous collection of horns, and
is one of the really nice guys in this business.


SAXQUEST GRAND OPENING 
June 14 - Noon to 6:30PM 


Saxquest is happy to announce the Grand Opening of its new store front
location and the Grand Opening of the Saxquest Saxophone Museum. The museum
showcases a huge collection of many of the finest and rarest saxophones in
the world as well as a collection of vintage saxophone accessories and other
historic saxophone memorabilia. The museum is located on the 2nd floor of
the Saxquest shop and is free and open to the public. 


Included in the museum&#39;s collection is a fully restored quartet of original
pre-civil war Adolphe Sax saxophones (soprano, alto, tenor and baritone).
Adolphe Sax invented the saxophone in 1846 and very few of his original
instruments still exist. Also featured is a Conn-O-Sax, made by the C.G.
Conn company in 1928. This wonderful and fascinating instrument was the
brainchild of their ill-conceived idea of replacing the orchestra&#39;s English
horn with a saxophone. Other highlights from the collection include a
quintet of 1920&#39;s vintage gold plate artist model Conn saxophones (alto,
c-melody, tenor, bari, bass) with exquisite hand cut engraving, a 1950&#39;s
vintage arcrylic Grafton saxophone (made famous by Charlie Parker at Massey
Hall in New York), a Selmer Paris saxophone commemorating their 1904 St.
Louis World&#39;s Fair gold medal for clarinet design, and many other rare and
one-of-a-kind saxes. From the huge bass saxophone to the obscenely small
sopranisimo saxophone, the Saxquest Saxophone Museum is a real St. Louis
treasure for the music lover or the eclectic museum goer. 


Saxquest has established itself as one of the most trusted saxophone
specialty shops in the United States and the only one in the St. Louis metro
area. Saxquest carries one of the largest inventories of vintage saxophones
in the country as well as a full line of saxophone and clarinet accessories
offered at the lowest prices anywhere. The Saxquest repair shop has garnered
national attention. Two full time master-craftsmen and one apprentice
perform complete mechanical restorations on woodwind and brass instruments
and cater to musicians demanding top-professional level work. As such,
Saxquest takes in work from some of the most discriminating professional
players all over the country in addition to doing many local repairs. 


Grand Opening Day Events 


The Saxquest Grand Opening Day will include numerous activities marking this
unique event including performances, recitals, clinics and master-classes by
top level professionals, all free and open to the public. Saxquest is a
strong advocate of the local St. Louis music scene and believes
whole-heartedly in supporting music education for adults and our city&#39;s
youth. Food and drink will be served and door prizes awarded. We invite
everyone to come celebrate with us, and encourage St. Louis visitors to make
the Saxquest Saxophone Museum a must-see stop on their journey through our
great city. Detailed schedule of the day&#39;s events below:

playing the saxophone.

associate professor of music at Webster University He&#39;s an active and
well-respected jazz performer and clinician on both the national stage and

Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and other playing credits too numerous to
mention. 


4PM-5PM - Kim Bock jazz performance and clinic - Kim Bock is one of the
truly great young jazz musicians on the New York scene today. His playing
draws on a multitude of influences including Wayne Shorter and John Coltrane
and exudes a deep musical sensibility and instrumental expertise. Born in
Denmark, Kim got one of his first big breaks when he was picked up by
Maynard Ferguson in 2000, touring extensively with his Big Bop Nouveau Band.
He has since gone on to record with his own quartet and most recently an
organ trio (SteepleChase label). 


"Kim Bock is a player that fits into the category of world-famous jazz
artists that have passed through my band, to name a few; Wayne Shorter,
Chick Corea, Peter Erskine and Slide Hampton. As my featured tenor saxophone
player, Kim displays, night after night, outstanding musicianship with
exceptional skills on the saxophone and a deep knowledge of the jazz idiom
that makes a truly great jazz artist" - Maynard Ferguson 


"Mr. Bock is an exceptional player who has matched the physical challenges
of his instrument, as illustrated by impressive technique and an appealing
tone, both of which he has achieved through genuine talent and serious wood
shedding. He&#39;s done lots of listening, and his playing on tenor has reminded
me of John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter" - Phillip Booth (contributor to
DownBeat & Jazziz) 


5PM-6:30PM - OPEN JAM SESSION - Hang out and play with Kim Bock and
others...........

The Music Business is a cruel and  shallow money trench, a long plastic
hallway where thieves and  pimps run free and good men die like dogs.
There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
