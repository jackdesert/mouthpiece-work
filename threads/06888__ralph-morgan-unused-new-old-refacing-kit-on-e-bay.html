            <pre class='message__body'>I wouldn&#39;t normally do this but this is very special and very pertinent. I bought this 20 some years ago. It arrived the day of a move from Denver to Hawaii. I just quickly packed it unopened.  I then couldn&#39;t find it until today. I took the tape off to photo it and closed it up. Thats it. I only post here so maybe a musician rather than collector grabs it. 1o days ago I got a divorce announcement or why the H__L would I sell this!  If moderators kill this I understand.  John Z
