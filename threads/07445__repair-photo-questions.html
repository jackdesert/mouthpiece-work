            <pre class='message__body'>Keith,

What does the brass powder epoxy consist of?  I think you said you 
ground brass rods down to dust and added it to light colored epoxy - 
yes?  Is it just for looks?

Also, is that just epoxy on the shanks of the Brilhart Tonalins?

            <pre class='message__body'>I purchased the brass (bronze) epoxy from McMaster-Carr a few years ago.  It was like $65.  I think Theo used to use it for baffles in his custom Link STM jobs.  It looks great new but not when it tarnishes.  Plus, I do not think it is as good for baffles as a plumbers epoxy putty.  It can fall out after a few years.

My Brilhart Tonalin shank repairs are banded with wraps of music wire, coated with a thin clear epoxy and overcoated with black epoxy.
