Paul, I think your sane 
Give up the tinfoil Paul. I think over the course of time and through 
history some pretty grim ulterior motives will arise from all of this. 
Its a sad time in our nation for many reasons. On another topic, I

            <pre class='message__body'>I know this is a MouthpieceWork discussion group, but as long as this 
post has been allowed to remain on the board as long as it&#39;s 
been "hung" here, I thought I&#39;d add my own two cents...

I&#39;m somewhat curious as to what "ulterior motives" someone could 
possibly fathom.  Those suspicions, I would guess, range from silly to 
completely insulting and disrespectful.

Certainly what transpired down there was a complete SNAFU with a long 
list of people at fault for what transipred (including God for the 
hurricane, if you are so inclined).

Somebody please remove this tripe (including my own response here) 
from this discussion board.

If these posts must remain for some reason, then I suggest that talk 
like this be posted to some other group.  It steals from what is 
otherwise a very credible, enjoyable and interesting group to 
participate in.

            <pre class='message__body'>Well the last post HAD been 5 days ago so I thought the topic was 
fading away.  If others also want to stir the pot, I will clean it up.  
I prefer to let it rest.  Less work for me.

I allow off-topic discussion as long as they do not dominate this 
group.  So far I&#39;ve been pleased with the balance.
