a beast (the mouthpiece, not my wife)! Anyone have any discussion on the
huge window? This is the loudest mofo&#39; I&#39;ve ever played. It blows very
easily (with a sufficiently soft reed) and is quite responsive. It also has
a VERY long facing. Any thoughts on these, and any insights into the design

Congrats on the mouthpiece and especially on having a wife that would 
bless you like that. These are awesome pieces. Long, high baffle + 
large chamber = one free blowing mouthpiece. The long window adds 
chamber volume and effectively eliminates the obstruction normally 
found at the back of the window.

Getting a handmade piece&#39;s table flat with a big window is difficult 
(for me anyway). The section of the table that overlaps the window 
ends up lower than the rest of the table because there&#39;s less surface 
area on the lapping table. You&#39;ve got to apply pressure at the right 
spot to get the table to lap evenly. Probably the best way is to get 
the table flat and then cut the large window.

Lately, I&#39;ve been messing around with some large window designs since 
they seem to work well with vintage horns. I just finished a bronze 
tenor piece that has a .135" tip, a 26mm facing length, a very high 
front baffle, large chamber and long window. It is totally outrageous 
on a Buescher New Aristocrat. It&#39;s way too much mouthpiece for me but 
would be a lot of fun on a R&R gig.

C-ya,
Jon Lloyd

            <pre class='message__body'>Jon, 
Have you compared the effect of opening a large window to the 
alternative of tapering the edge at the end of the window (making a 
shallow knife edge so it is not such an interruption). I noticed that 
Theo&#39;s pieces are finished like this and have been experimenting with 
some Runyon Custom blanks that I have to get a comparison between 
blunt and knife edge (seems to make the piece more free-blowing with 
the knife edge, but the piece loses some edge), but these have no 
baffle.

Jeff,
I guess I&#39;ve always removed the blunt edge at the window. I hadn&#39;t 
really noticed any loss in edge since I work mostly on high baffle 
pieces. I&#39;ve only done a few long widows, and none of them are as 
long as the Rovner. The long window is nice on narrow metal pieces 
when you can&#39;t enlarge the chamber because the side walls are too 
thin.

Jon

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi folks,

Since the part of the reed that rests over the lower part of the window (before the rail break) is essentially inert, it seems reasonable to expect that extending the window back into the table shouldn&#39;t have much effect. It will increase the volume slightly in the chamber at the position that the material is removed but unless the mpc is extremely thick it won&#39;t change things that much, it seems to me.

  Jeff,
  I guess I&#39;ve always removed the blunt edge at the window. I hadn&#39;t 
  really noticed any loss in edge since I work mostly on high baffle 
  pieces. I&#39;ve only done a few long widows, and none of them are as 
  long as the Rovner. The long window is nice on narrow metal pieces 
  when you can&#39;t enlarge the chamber because the side walls are too 
  thin.
