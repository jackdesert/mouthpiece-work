Hello,

I&#39;m tying to sell off some sax stuff I don&#39;t use. One of the accessories
is a TM Link. It is the gold plated pce featured in the photos on this
site "Otto Link queary - re: msg 6490". I got the 2 pces shown from a
guy, now in his 80&#39;s, and he is not sure when he bought them. He used
the silver STM exclusively very early on. I had this pce refaced by
Keith a while back and it is the one I use . It plays great. From info
acquired I believe these pces were bought in the 50&#39;s. The gold TM is in
great shape and barely used. I have not seen any that have sold of this
vintage and shape on Ebay. Any ideas what this mpce would be worth?
Ballbark...?

Any info would be appreciated.
