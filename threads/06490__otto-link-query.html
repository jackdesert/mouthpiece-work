            <pre class='message__body'>Hello all,
I have 2 links, a silver STM, with a 7 on one side of the barrel near 
the table and what looks like a 3*, most of the number gone,at the 
end end of the table, and L33 on the other side of the barrel just 
below the table. 
I also have a gold plated Tone Master with a 9 and a dot after the 
stamped name on the collar/opening to the neck. On the other side is 
Otto Link,New York. There is a 7 on the table and what looks like a 4 
digit/letter ser# on the side of the barrel of the mpce. 
The gold Link is like new, rails are even,a good tip rail but seems 
stuffy relative to the silver STM which I had Mojo reface a while 
back. The baffles differ in that the TM&#39;s round over baffle follows 
the arc of the tip rail and starts immediately then drops down into 
a large chamber, the floor of which is a bit concaved and not flat. 
The 
STM&#39;s round over baffle is straight from rail to rail and starts 
farther away from the tip than the Tone Mster. The floor of the 
chamber in the STM seems more flat after the baffle and then 
gradually forms the same concave type floor as of the TM.
Can anyone with Otto Link experience shed some lite on what the 
markings mean as mentioned above and if the style and the difference 
in how the air stream enters the mpce ( close to tip rndover. baffle, 
arced/ farther from tip, straight) make the difference in the back 
pressure/stuffiness of one from the other. 
Do Links benefit much by extending the baffleing beyond the rndover, 
ie. raising the floor and reducing the chamber volume/back pressure 
slightly before going into the rest of the chamber? Any info would be 
appreciated.

Pictures would help to go along with the text.
Â 
On tid-bit is that the 9 dot is actually a dotted half note, even though the note is mirrored from the way it is usually written.

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice picture.  I have never read anything about the significance of 
Link serial numbers.

As for the difference in how they play... I would think you find the 
Tone Master short roll-over baffle and concavity more stuffy than this 
STM&#39;s longer roll-over baffle.  You can try adding some temporary 
putty to the Tone Master to make it look more like the STM as a test.  
But I would not add epoxy to the Tone Master to change it.  Just sell 
it if you do not like it.  Someone else would probably want it the way 
it is.

  Nice picture. I have never read anything about the significance of 
  Link serial numbers.

  As for the difference in how they play... I would think you find the 
  Tone Master short roll-over baffle and concavity more stuffy than this 
  STM&#39;s longer roll-over baffle. You can try adding some temporary 
  putty to the Tone Master to make it look more like the STM as a test. 
  But I would not add epoxy to the Tone Master to change it. Just sell 
  it if you do not like it. Someone else would probably want it the way 
  it is.
