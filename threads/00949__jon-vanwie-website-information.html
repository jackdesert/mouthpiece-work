            <pre class='message__body'>I became interested in mouthpiece work shortly after John Vanwie 
became ill, so I never had the chance to talk with him or review the 
information on his site.  I discovered tonight, however, that with 
Google&#39;s cache feature, most of the pages are still available 
(although I don&#39;t know how long Google saves cached pages).

To view (and I suggest - print) his information regarding facing, 
shaping your sound, etc., go to www.google.com and paste the 
following line into the search window:

site:www.jonvanwie.com Jon Van Wie Sax Mouthpiece Services

There should be about 68 total pages of results from Google&#39;s 
cache.To view the pages, you can&#39;t click on the link as usual, 
because they are no longer posted on his site.  Instead, click the 
word cached at the bottom of each description.

I hope no one takes offense at this posting.  No disrespect to Jon 
is intended.

Though the possibility of being successfully sued for copyright infringement and being fined is slim, the right thing to do would be to contact his widow and get her written permission. I think it&#39;s a good thing to do just to give Jon his due credit to prevent an unscrupulous opportunist from making a buck off someone else&#39;s work. I remember  Jon having left an address (on SOTW) where his wife could be contacted. I bet that she would give written permission for this forum to use the website content as long as she would be given credit and that a copyright notice bearing her name and Jon&#39;s name appears on the images and in the text. If someone contacts her, I would be happy to compose a contract which concerned parties could sign and be protected. If someone can send me the captured images accompanied by a written release (the contract) I&#39;ll be happy to put a copyright notice on all images. For that matter, anyone who has any photographic imaging program can do the same.

There was certainly some valuable information there!

Keep in mind that there is now an Internet Archive.  As the name suggests, it
keeps an archive of web pages.  There are already quite a few entries for Jon&#39;s
site, though I haven&#39;t actually looked to see what all is there.  Here is the
link:

Howdy All!

http://www.archive.org is a neat web feature.

http://web.archive.org/web/20020523032022/http://jonvanwie.com/ appears to
have the whole site archived and online.

            <pre class='message__body'>I am amazed at the collective resourcefullness of you guys!

I copied this off the archive site:

JONVANWIE.COM page design, text and images owned by Jon Van Wie and Jai
Salvatori; created or edited by Jai Salvatori.  

Contact Jai at: webmaster@...

If someone wants to spearhead getting the permissions, go ahead.  Its just
not going to be one of my projects.

I do have an interest in getting permission to post scans of Ralph Morgan&#39;s
Sax Journal articles.  Someday I&#39;ll persue this, but I fear SJ wont play. 
Does anyone know if permission is needed from Ralph Morgan and SJ?

In a nutshell: if the work isn&#39;t yours (i.e., if you did not create it), it does not belong to you, so you need permission to reproduce the articles for public display. 

I wouldn&#39;t assume that Sax Journal would not give you permission to reprint the articles you mention in part or in whole if you were to write to the publication, telling them who you are, what you do, and why you want to reproduce the information contained in their journal. Research depends upon the published work of others, and it is part and parcel of publishing to grant reproduction rights to those who wish to further the cause of the publication, especially if there is no monetary gain on the part of the secondary publisher. You need to present a very compelling reason for wanting to reproduce the articles, convince them that you will give full credit to the authors and publishers, and that neither you nor your organization stands to profit from the republication of the articles. How many articles do you read which are almost entirely based upon reports originally found in JAMA? (This is the Journal of the American Medical Association). I see lots of articles which have credits at the end which read : Reproduced with permission of the Journal of the American medical Association.

One possible way around the copyright problem is to quote the articles, using quotation marks, then attach a works cited page to the end of your own article. This, however, requires you to reproduce the articles in part, incorporating them into an article or as a part of research. 

The easiest way is just to send a letter to the editor of SJ and tell him what you want to do with the articles. If you can make your argument in such a way that reprinting the articles will benefit, the journal, you&#39;ll probably get permission, especially if their business does not depend heavily upon reprints or reissues of past volumes.

several of the older ones are sold out.  I would think they would at least
allow scans from the sold out ones to be posted.

I&#39;ll put it on my list to contact them.

            <pre class='message__body'>Keith, The word here is "schmooze." You need to state a compelling case for SJ to allow Yahoogroups.com to use the articles. When you write to them, you need to tell them that you represent a group of 100+ saxophonists who are interested in reading the old articles, and that the forum would be a good place for SJ&#39;s presence. You could even offer to put in a pitch in the Yahoogroup for the Saxophone Journal and mention the publication as a sponsor.  If you need a letter to be written, I&#39;d be happy to compose one for you to send to SJ. Let me know.

In fact, there are many past issues which are no longer available.  If
permission is granted, I have all Saxophone Journal issues going back to
Sept/Oct 1988 Vol 13 #2.
