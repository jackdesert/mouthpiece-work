            <pre class='message__body'>There are a few freely available perl scripts that can be used to backup yahoo groups.  

When I first joined this group a couple of years ago, I wanted to catch up on all of the previous messages so that I could fully understand the conversation moving forward.  I started by going through the yahoo website, but found this to be a really bad interface for reading that many messages.  I think there were 4000 or so posts at the time.  I used this perl script to download all of the messages:

http://www.tt-solutions.com/en/Products/yahoo2mbox

The advantage was that it put the messages in a format where they could easily be imported into my normal mail reader.  This made them really convenient to read, search, and organize(threading).

I think that backing up the site using something similar to this is much better than backing it up by capturing the html.  If there was any sort of problem with yahoo, recreating the groups on yahoo or another hosting service would be VERY difficult using html as a starting point.
