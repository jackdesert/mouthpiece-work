            <pre class='message__body'>I just spent 4 hours turning a wonderful mouthpiece into a doorstop. 
Turns out that my glass had a tiny "bad spot" on it causing me to 
create a perfectly crooked facing! The result is suprising: the piece 
plays pretty well if you put it on the sax at an angle so that more 
lip pressure is applied to one side than the other. I thought that it 
would be very resistant with lots of chirps, but not so.

So, here&#39;s a frendly reminder to remember to check your glass and 
feelers and make sure everything is clean.

            <pre class='message__body'>To add to his reminder... remove the price sticker from the backside of 
your silicon carbide paper.  (Can you guess how I picked up this tip?)

            <pre class='message__body'>Another tip: Occassionally try flipping your feelers around so you 
measure the right rail with the region you normally use to measure 
the left rail, and vice-versa.  If the reading is not the same, your 
feeler is not uniform enough or has a dirt spot.
