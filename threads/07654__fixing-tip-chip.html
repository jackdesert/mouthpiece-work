Sorry for this. What is the basic technique for filling a small tip(corner)

This stuff is nothing short of AMAZING for doing all sorts of repairs.  It has been rumored that Dave Jary has used this in a pinch.  If it is good enough for Dave then it is good for anyone.

Apoxie might work.  But I think it is a little too soft for tip repairs, so I have not used it for that.  It is a good material for baffles in HR mouthpieces.

I use Apoxie for baffles all the time, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hard enough for a tip repair.

I&#39;ve used a couple of their products, not on mpc, but other things and the staff there is really helpful in selecting the correct product.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m a big fan of two-part "epoxy putty" (in Australia the most common 
brand = Selleys Knead-It), I&#39;ve used it in many situations and it&#39;s 
supposed to be so strong when set that you can make replacement hammer 
heads out of it (!). I&#39;ve used it to extend the shank on a custom tenor 
mpc that was far too short, more alto length, too short to tune 
properly.. just put the mouthpiece lightly on the neck then moulded the 
kneaded epoxy putty around the end of the mouthpiece and back on to the 
cork, wait 5mins to set and remove. Of course this method didn&#39;t result 
in an even shank thickness (depending on the finishing) and the bore of 
the "extended shank" ended up with a rough look as a result of the cork 
surface, but it certainly did the job and it can easily be sanded, filed 
and painted.

I would be careful not to do this on a mouthpiece which needs to 
maintain a "professional finish" for eventual re-sale.

I am thinking, is this the same material being proposed as not suitable 
for tip repair? It can certainly be sanded/filed easily, no easier than 
hard rubber though.. and certainly hard enough, it is even made in a 
"waterproof" version.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the suggestion. Here&#39;s one that might help. too.

Wrap the cork in "Glad Press N Seal" first and the inside should dry pretty smoothly. In the USA, Glad Press N Seal is like a shrink wrap for your food dish, but one side is sticky and the other is not. I have used it for a release agent in other situations. It should not mess up the cork or allow putty residue penetration.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think J-B Weld is the hardest epoxy available.  It hardens just like the more expensively packaged MarineTex, with which I have repaired cracked engine blocks and a 32&#39; steel boat hull.  It might be advantageous to drill a very small (your hobby shop will have some very, very thin drill bits) hole or two (at angles to one another) to anchor the epoxy.  Otherwise temperature fluxuations and/or vibrational stress could cause the repair to pop out of place over time.
