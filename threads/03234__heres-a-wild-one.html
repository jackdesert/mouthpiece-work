Now why on earth would my sax/mpc (on octave E and D) play more in
tune with a Rovner vs a metal lig.  Is it perhaps dampening overtones
that are sending the note sharp?  I cant begin to understand this.  A
couple of my other piece dont play sharp on the notes Ive been talking
about so it does not seem endemic to the horn.  Mysteries of the
wonderful world of sax.
