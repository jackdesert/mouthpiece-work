In your recent video where you close down the tip of the Link you are using an updated version of your facing spreadsheet.  Might you be willing to post that version in the files section?  Or if it is elsewhere in the group folders, where might I find it?

Hello Keith,

In your recent video where you close down the tip of the Link you are using an updated version of your facing spreadsheet. Might you be willing to post that version in the files section? Or if it is elsewhere in the group folders, where might I find it?

Thanks so much,

Mike

            <pre class='message__body'>I have made my own spreadsheet based on what Keith has posted here. I have made it fit my feelers, and I have made &#8203;&#8203;three sheets where I place the original facingen in the first, this is then transmitted to the last sheet, which I use when I work. Sheet 2 is one that calculates a radial facing curve, based on data that I put into the sheet 3 ... It makes it easy to constantly make small adjustments and to constantly monitor the changes from the original.

 - Yes, it works well for me, but it is hardly meaningful to others .... ;-)
