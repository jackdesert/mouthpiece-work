            <pre class='message__body'>Apart from the taper gages in the Winslow and Morgan kits, or from 
J.J. Babbitt, does anybody have experience with either the Starrett 
270 taper gage for .010-0150" or the GAL taper gage for 1/32" to 5/8"?

And, has anybody tried working with a Starrett depth gauge with a 
longer, 6 inch, base?

For measuring and working on chambers or bores, what contour gauges, 
scrapers, reamers, and inside telescopic gauges are available or 
preferred?

In the process of trying to place an online order for the Winslow kit 
through Woodwind & Brasswind, it seems as though there&#39;s been a 
recent merger between them and Music123.com and some resulting 
confusion on both websites.  I&#39;ll end up calling in the order but has 
anybody heard anything about who merged with whom?
