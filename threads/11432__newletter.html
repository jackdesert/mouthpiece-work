            <pre class='message__body'>I put out a very irregular newsletter out various subjects for woodwind
players interested in tips from my career. Yes there is a little sharing of
my products to, however the major point is the subject matter at the
beginning of the newsletter. This time out we are going to talk about the
importance of silence in music. If you think you would be interested you can
always sign up on www.saxandclarinetmouthpieces.com
&lt;http://www.saxandclarinetmouthpieces.com>  where you can also read past
newsletters. The next letter goes out tomorrow (Saturday) at 10 AM

 

Thanks for your consideration.

 

Mike Vaccaro
