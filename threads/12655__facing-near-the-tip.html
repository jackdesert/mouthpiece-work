            <pre class='message__body'>The pictures show two of the facings of alto mouthpieces I measured. Both are quite close to the radial curve. Most facings seem to be more open at the tip then the radial curve. But some facings have a facing that is less open at the tip, like the conn steelay. What is the purpose of this?

            <pre class='message__body'>The Yamaha curve is like what I called a parabolic-like curve.

The reverse flip near the tip of the conn facing is just wrong.  Either a measurement error or a bad spot. I would expect it not to articulate well.

            <pre class='message__body'>The photo shows it is not a measurement error. I have a Panamerican mp that shows the same flip. Two candidates for a refacing ;-). I am curious to experience the difference.</pre>
