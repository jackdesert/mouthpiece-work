            <pre class='message__body'>hello to all
I have found (in a old box of Vandoren reed) a brochure about tip openings and facing lengths in cm. for V5 an Java mouthpieces. I have posted it to the Photo Section under Brochure. 
Have anyone measured or played mouthpiece like T97 or A95 (with theese very long facings)? 
Ciao a tutti

            <pre class='message__body'>What would really be important is to see the measurement of the .010" 
feeler, the "break" area of the facing.  If two mouthpieces had similar 
measurements for the .010" feeler, but one had the .0015" (which 
normally is used to quote the facing length) at 5 mm longer than .010", 
and the other was 10 mm longer than the .010", the two mouthpieces would 
play very nearly the same.
