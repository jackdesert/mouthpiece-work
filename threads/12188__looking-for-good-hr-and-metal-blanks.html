            <pre class='message__body'>As I couldn't find any manufacturer where in Europe ( Germany) or China, US that sells good blanks , 
 I thought to post here.
 

 I am am looking to purchase a number of good HR tenor blanks , that have a good quality smelly Hard Rubber ..like the German or French ( I've got few German HR rods but not ready for working with Lathe yet :(
 

 Would be very welcome if those blanks have enough room for putting various openings from 6-8 to shape a longer or medium buffle and medium to large chamber and are big enough in diameter to accommodate most link / selmer type  ligatures.
  also  looking for metal tenor blanks with the same requirements.
 

 

 Hopefully some of you mouthpiece masters might have few still laying around :)
 

 Thanks in advance for your replies , feel free to email me directly at jazzroom@gmail.com

            <pre class='message__body'>My company is considering entering the mouthpiece blank business……do any of you have additional requirements other than those stated in this post? Most importantly, what is your budget per blank? We have some reservations about this being an economically viable business….
