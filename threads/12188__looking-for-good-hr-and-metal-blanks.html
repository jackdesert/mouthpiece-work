            <pre class='message__body'>As I couldn't find any manufacturer where in Europe ( Germany) or China, US that sells good blanks , 
 I thought to post here.
 

 I am am looking to purchase a number of good HR tenor blanks , that have a good quality smelly Hard Rubber ..like the German or French ( I've got few German HR rods but not ready for working with Lathe yet :(
 

 Would be very welcome if those blanks have enough room for putting various openings from 6-8 to shape a longer or medium buffle and medium to large chamber and are big enough in diameter to accommodate most link / selmer type  ligatures.
  also  looking for metal tenor blanks with the same requirements.
 

 

 Hopefully some of you mouthpiece masters might have few still laying around :)
 

 Thanks in advance for your replies , feel free to email me directly at jazzroom@gmail.com
