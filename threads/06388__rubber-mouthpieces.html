When I was young, I&#39;ve played for several years alto saxophone in a 
marching band often in extreme wheater conditions. I always used a 
cheap yamaha plastic mouthpiece and never had any problem. What kind 
of mouthpieces they play? In any case every material including brass 
(metal mouthpieces) expands with heat. This problem is more evident 
in wood mouthpieces which are more sensitive to external changes but 
it is present in HR mouthpiece too. In any case if the expansion 
is "uniform" it should not affect so much the mouthpiece response 
but... if for some reason it is not uniform and table bending is 
involved then the player will clearly feel something of different 
(the mouthpice can easily become unplayable).
Just an opinion based on direct experience,

Dan

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
     I wonder if  heating up a rubber  mouthpiece affects how the air
"bounces off the sides, or perhaps  a tight ligature  can temporarily
distort  a rubber facing.
    I had the opposite experience on a cold winter day in Montreal  (
around -25F) . I left the reed and   ligature  tight on the mouthpiece
for several hours in my car and distorted the table permanently on a
really nice rubber Otto Link. I didn&#39;t  know how to reface at the time
and my poor efforts made it even worse.        Peter Deley

            <pre class='message__body'>Not just the mouthpiece is affected. Metal expands and contracts with
temperature, and the density of the air also changes. I think those are
probably larger effects.

I&#39;ve noticed an intonation difference between practicing in a room at 85
degrees F and 70-75 degrees F, in terms of mouthpiece position on the neck
in order to be in tune.

I&#39;ve also had the experience of playing a gig outdoors on a windy cloudy day
with sudden temperature shifts; every time a cool moist wind came up, I&#39;d go
out of tune.

            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I'd love to hear from some of you engineers about this, but I think that the
higher pitch at higher temperatures is not due to the metal expanding on the
inside of the horn, but is due to the air column inside the horn expanding at
a much, much greater rate than the metal does. So while the tube of the
instrument may expand a very small bit, the air inside expands a whole lot,
resulting in an effectively shorter tube length for that amount of air. So the
pitch goes up in hot weather. Our sound is being made by the vibrating air
column - contrast this to guitars (and all strings) which get flat in the
heat, because their sound is being generated by the string itself, which gets
more slack (and flatter) as it expands. This is where the tuning of winds with
strings gets dicey - we de-tune in different directions with temperature
change.  
  
As to the original question that started this thread, my experience with
horns/mpcs/reeds out in the blazing sun is that the reed is much more
susceptible to change than the mouthpiece. It dries out (sometimes only on one
side), warps, etc.

            <pre class='message__body'>  Good points.
      I think you are right on in what you say. That is probably why bari saxes are the most stable pitch-wise in a sax section once everyone has warmed up. The bari is so big that the player&#39;s breath only warms the first section of the tubing. The remainder of the sax stays at ambient temperature.       Peter

I reasently got a questione from a sax player, playing in a militery 
band. Some of the sax players felt that when they were playing and 
marching in the heat on a synny day, their hard rubber mouthpieces were 
changing, and sounding different. They are very qualified professionel 
players, and well avare of the problems with the reed under such 
conditions, so that&#39;s not the issue. 
Has anybody in this great group heard of such a problem, or is it just 
a "feeling" they get rather than a real problem. -- Is the rubber 
expanding, or what? I would be very greatful if some more experinced 
refacers had some thougts about it.
