            <pre class='message__body'>There&#39;s been an interesting discussion on mouthpiece physics at the 
Sax On The Web mouthpiece forum: 

http://forum.saxontheweb.net/forum_rmpc.html

I asked a question about the dynamics going on with mouthpieces, 
especially aerodynamics and airflow, and got some pretty good 
feedback.  It seems that there hasn&#39;t been much definitive study on 
this, so it&#39;s trial and error for now... until this can be modelled 
accurately in a computer... 

Thanks Keith for the link to the Gary Scavone paper.  He had some 
really interesting things to say about mouthpiece design:
