Hello all,

For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m doing only clarinet facings and as much as 
I experiment (although I&#39;m only working with my blank [the Gennusa 
Excellente, designed by Iggy Gennusa and the folks at Babbitt]), the 
best numbers for a clarinet facing are the classic ones that Iggy 
taught me and that Matson said were the best:  34, 22, 12, 6.  I&#39;m 
personally playing these numbers with a 117 tip opening and a Canyes 
Xilema reed (www.xilema.net) in D (or 4) strength (I just rethought 
my playing and decided to make more of the reed vibrate by going 
more open--I was playing a 102 until just very recently).  I play 
equally classical and jazz (with the exact same set-up).  I recently 
made several mouthpieces for Ricardo Morales and two of his 
colleagues in the Philadelphia orchestra and for three members of 
the Met Opera Orchestra.  They are playing these numbers with tip 
opening ranges from 108-117.  I&#39;m actually meeting these people 
again for some more work this weekend in New York.  If anyone is 
interested, I&#39;d love to meet up with you.  I&#39;ll be there in the 
afternoon of the 22nd and will leave sometime on the 24th.  Thanks, 
I enjoy this forum.

Hello,

I&#39;m answering two questions.  I hope you don&#39;t mind.  My gauges are 
the ones from the Brand kit--.0015, .010, .024, .034.  A lot of people 
like tip openings in the 1-1.06 mm range.  For those, I get 
measurements that read: 34, 22, 10, 4.  For the ones that I&#39;ve been 
making most recently, I&#39;m getting 34, 22, 12, 6, with a 1.08-1.17 tip 
opening.  Obviously, the two short measurements get larger the more 
open I make them, but essentially, I am keeping to those numbers.  For 
the tip openings in the 1.05-1.12 range, the numbers are really closer 
to 11 and 5, but I continually play test after a few cuts and will 
accept numbers that are not exactly perfect if the mouthpiece plays 
great.  I&#39;m really not making a lot of mouthpieces in that 1.05-1.12 
range.  People tend to like them either close or open at least 
recently with my blank.  At this point in my development, I do believe 
that the blank you use contributes heavily to the facing that works 
best, as well as, of course, the reed you are using.
