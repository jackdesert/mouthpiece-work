            <pre class='message__body'>Eddie,
 
 it comes out basically that 
 The evaluation of the sound quality showed a very small range
and listen to the mp3 the only big evidence is showed when different musicians are playing, and on this example
   player 2,      note g2     on all flutes
 from the small speakers on my Mac I can listen only a few very small difference on sustain at the end of the note, as in the 4th and 6th flute playing. But so small and probably more evident if analyzed using good studio neutral monitors.
 I want to try to save the files and listen those on my studio with old Auratone.
 
 But looking at the graphic or the flute, it&#39;s strange as many reconize the plain silver flute but they miss totally on gold 9K and 18K !
 May be the ear is more accustomed to the plain silver? so that you can reconize easily but not the others if you are not familiar with?
 
 A natural question come out anyway... why when I listen a plain silver Artley flute, as the Artist model, I can heard a big difference respect to a silvered 104 model for student but with same setup (pads and so on...) ? Holes position are different? or what?

      My limited experience of flutes indicates that student and   
>  advanced models use the same hole placement, but Silver lip plates
 and silver head linings on wooden flutes, are sometimes used to
enhance the tone.

            <pre class='message__body'>Hole positions might be similar, but differences in the bore and head joint geometry cause the differences. If you measure the two flutes this will become evident. Also manufacturing differences can cause slight ripples in the metal, especially around the extruded tone holes. Very small differences in bore geometry can make very significant differences in response and tone. I believe also that most student flutes are designed for ease of response at the expense of tone quality.
