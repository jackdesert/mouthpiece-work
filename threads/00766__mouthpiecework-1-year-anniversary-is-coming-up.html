We have grown steadily until we have become one of the top 3 
Saxaphone Groups on Yahoo in terms of registered members.  Since 
membersip is not required to read our archives, files, and links, I&#39;m 
sure we have provided information to many more interested folks.

I, for one, have learned a lot via this group.  Even when I give 
advice, the group is a sounding board that helps me to clarify my 
thoughts (separate from those other voices in my head).  When you 
hang an idea out there, you may be only 80% sure of yourself.  Having 
someone chime in with "Yeah, that works for me!" validates your 
thoughts.

There have also been a few well known pros who have answered some of 
my questions via Email.  They have preferred to not to have their 
knowledge posted publicly but have steered me, and indirectly some of 
my replies to this group, in the proper direction.  I thank them.

Now that I am taking on more work for clients, I&#39;m getting feedback 
from other players.  About 9 out of 10 have been thrilled, so I must 
be doing something right.  I wish it could be 10 out of 10, but that 
is not possible due to several reasons (another good discussion 
topic).

*********************************************************************
So in celebration of this anniversary, I want to hold a prize drawing 
on March 13, 2003.  I&#39;m going to offer a free MOJO mouthpiece 
rework!  You supply the mouthpiece and get it to me.  I&#39;ll rework it 
and send it back to you.
*********************************************************************

To be eligible for the prize, you must have posted a message to the 
MouthpieceWork forum in the last year.  I&#39;m thinking of generating a 
random message post number and we&#39;ll see who it is.  Yes, this is 
biased to those who have posted more often.  But those are the 
members who have helped to build this archive.  

I&#39;ll toss out any posts I think are not on topic.  I&#39;ll see how the 
next 2 weeks look before I decide if they will be included in the 
MOJO lottery.

If anyone wants to offer a 2nd or 3rd prize (or a better 1st prize) 
let me know.

            <pre class='message__body'>Cool!
:-)

Also, while I think of it, I&#39;ve just been loaned a copy of a band 
instrument repair book, and it has a whole chapter on refacing 
mouthpieces. I&#39;m still reading through it, but if I find anything 
really interesting, I&#39;ll let you all know. But I can tell from what 
it says that when I first started to alter my mouthpiece, I did 
absolutely everything wrong as far as the book is concerned! No 
wonder the mouthpiece didn&#39;t work - But I&#39;ve fixed that, and it seems 
that (as far as the book is concerned), most of what I did to fix it 
was right (but it&#39;s still a little bit more difficult to play than it 
should be). Very interesting book!

Also, I&#39;ve been loaned a book on making and modifying sax and 
clarinet reeds, and it looks like it&#39;s going to be quite interesting 
too. I would be inclined to scan the books and put them into the 
files section here (I think they&#39;re out of copyright now), but I 
don&#39;t have a scanner...

Best Regards,

Danny

        my experience and theory&#39;s , even rethink some issues .  
 
        I even started making mouthpieces using Ebony and a synthetic material.  Some good results , some mediocre but
        the effort was worth it. Just playing one off your own pieces and liking it just as much as an old favourite MPC !

This sounds like the Erick Brand book.  It is still available from 
Ferree&#39;s.  If it is something different, be sure to let us know!

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, Keith is right.  The chapter on mouthpiece refacing (which used to
be a part of a standard overhaul way back when) from the Eric Brand
Repair Manual was also sold as a separate book.

There is nothing there that is not applicable today, except for one
minor thing.  Players use larger tip openings now, especially on the
saxophones.  The facing length feelers of the original Eric Brand kit
only went up to .050�.  Now it is necessary to have feelers up into the
.090� range.  I use a .094� (2.4 mm) for my largest gauge, as well as
.077� (2 mm),  .063� (1.6 mm).

But as for the rest, this manual is an excellent resource.

been meaning to get some scrap sheet metal and make some feelers of 
whatever thickness they happen to be, but unfortunately I&#39;ve been too

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Feeler Guages</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>Making your own feeler guages is not a good idea.  Shop around a little and
you can find an Asian made automotive set for $6-10.  Just make sure it has
a .0015" feeler in it.  Standard sets stop around .035" so you can consider
making your own larger ones.

For the larger sizes, I have not found a great solution.  I currently have
several of the smaller sizes taped together on the ends with electrical
tape.  I then measured the actual thickness with digital calipers and wrote
the thickness on the set.  I had to buy 2 sets of feelers to have enough to
tape together for a dedicated size.  There is a risk that set will shift
and warp over time, so you need to re-measure them so you know what you are
working with.

Guage blocks come in larger thicknesses.  But they are not in the feeler
guage shape.  I&#39;m considering some way to mount guage blocks within a
notched out spare feeler guages.

The plating is thin on the sets I&#39;m using and they are starting to show
some corrosion spots.  I recently purchased a couple of sets of stainless
steel feeler guages from McMaster-Carr.  But I have not switched over to
them yet.

Getting the larger sizes custom made at a machine shop may be the only way
to get really good ones.  Precision ground stainless steel would be the way
to go.  Maybe we could group together to get the quantity up and the price
lower?  I&#39;m looking for 5-7 sizes between .045" and .140".

            <pre class='message__body'>Hi Keith,

As a stopgap measure why not epoxy the gauges together rather than taping them? Wouldn&#39;t there be less chance of their shifting that way?

  Subject: [MouthpieceWork] Feeler Guages


  Making your own feeler guages is not a good idea.  Shop around a little and
  you can find an Asian made automotive set for $6-10.  Just make sure it has
  a .0015" feeler in it.  Standard sets stop around .035" so you can consider
  making your own larger ones.

  For the larger sizes, I have not found a great solution.  I currently have
  several of the smaller sizes taped together on the ends with electrical
  tape.  I then measured the actual thickness with digital calipers and wrote
  the thickness on the set.  I had to buy 2 sets of feelers to have enough to
  tape together for a dedicated size.  There is a risk that set will shift
  and warp over time, so you need to re-measure them so you know what you are
  working with.

  Guage blocks come in larger thicknesses.  But they are not in the feeler
  guage shape.  I&#39;m considering some way to mount guage blocks within a
  notched out spare feeler guages.

  The plating is thin on the sets I&#39;m using and they are starting to show
  some corrosion spots.  I recently purchased a couple of sets of stainless
  steel feeler guages from McMaster-Carr.  But I have not switched over to
  them yet.

  Getting the larger sizes custom made at a machine shop may be the only way
  to get really good ones.  Precision ground stainless steel would be the way
  to go.  Maybe we could group together to get the quantity up and the price
  lower?  I&#39;m looking for 5-7 sizes between .045" and .140".

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m considering using epoxy or cy glue with my new sets of stainless steel
feelers.

BTW, even name brand feelers vary by .0005".  You should check yours in the
area where you will be measuring with calipers or a micrometer.  If it is
off by that much from the left to right rail, your work will be flawed by
that much.  Its not huge, but you should minimize the errors you can.

            <pre class='message__body'>The 9 piece feeler set I use are included with the kit from Madison
Enterprises (John Winslow).  No need to make from scrap metal... these
are standard available sizes sizes.  There is also in the kit, .0015",
.010", .014", .024", .031", .048", in addition to the three sizes I
mentioned previously.

            <pre class='message__body'>I generated several random numbers falling within 1 and 808.  I then 
looked up the message posted on the Mouthpiece Work Group with that

number on my list.  I had to do this several times since Paul and I 
have posted a lot.

The winning message number for a free reface from me is: 244 posted 
by "Allen Moon" 7/16/02.

The winning message number for a free reface from Paul Coats is: 641 
posted by "Toby" 12/18/02.

I hope these winner will value these prizes in the spirit they were 
intended.  Contact us via Email or a post to discuss the logistics of 
claiming your prize.

            <pre class='message__body'>Allan Moon has declined the reface prize.  He is no longer a member 
of this group, but I did not state that you needed to be active.

The next number drawn is 78 which corresponds to a message posted by 
Phil Barone on 3/21/02.  So Phil, let me know if you would like to 
accept or decline a reface by me.  Either way, you&#39;re a winner!  I&#39;ll 
just keep pulling numbers until we get an acceptance.

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;m still trying to award this reface.  The problem is some of the 
winners are no longer member and/or do not read regularly.  So after 
a few days, I&#39;ll just post another number.

I&#39;m now looking for the poster of message #56, "tilemakerpro" from 
3/18/02, 1 year ago.
