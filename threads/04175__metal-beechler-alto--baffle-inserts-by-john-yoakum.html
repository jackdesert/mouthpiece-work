            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,
Does anybody know how can I get in touch with this mouthpiece refacer 
known as John Yoakum?
I&#39;m interested in building a baffle inside my Beechler bellite alto.
Anybody with similar experiences?  Or with your Beechlers done up the 
same way by another mouthpiece artist?

I think he is based in Los Angeles.

Have you tried experimenting on your own?  Try some dental wax.
