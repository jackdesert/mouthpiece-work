            <pre class='message__body'>Short facings are supposed to favor the high register, long facings 
favor the low.

My experience is that short facings do not play the high end better, but 
suffer in the low end.

Actual measurment of Boots Randolph&#39;s old Brilhart Satintone tenor 7* 
(the one he used to record Yakety Sax, Rock Around the Christmas Tree 
with Brenda Lee, etc) measured a very short 19 mm long facing with .095" 
tip opening.  However it played well in the low end.

I usually make tenor facings in the 23-24 range.  Most of the Runyon 
tenors are 22mm, with the Jaguar tenors measuring 23 mm length.

I know Mr. Runyon really agonized over the Jaguar alto, trying to decide 
between 21 and 22 mm facing length.  I was at his studio one day, he was 
testing the two, had me play both, and another player.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree with Paul about the supposed benefits.  If you think 21 is short you
should see the ARB Great Neck Original 4* I have on hand I think it&#39;s 34 on
the glass gauge.  For a tenor piece!  It must play G4 like a champ!!!! :-)

I think 48 is good up to about .100 and then I might consider going to 50 up
to .125.

            <pre class='message__body'>Just doing some research in the archives, and I have a question. The 
short facing cited for the V16 tenor piece: is that one and the same 
as the famous so-called short "French" style facing that Berg Larsen 
also offers (SMS facing?).

Another question: I have a Dukoff Super Power Chamber that isn&#39;t as 
soft as Silverite, doesn&#39;t appear to be silver itself, and can&#39;t be 
nickel-plated brass, because it&#39;s silver in color all the way 
through. What is it? (Sounds like a game show question.)

I have only seen consistently short facings on Beechlers and older Selmers.
 Berg facing lengths seem to be random in spite of the "SMS" or "M"
markings.

The newer ones (last few years) mostly are Nickel-plated over Silverite. 
The table, facing and interior are not plated.

            <pre class='message__body'>There are a lot of odd variations, but I have never seen an Aluminum
Dukoff.  If it was made Al, it would feel light in the hand.  I have 0wned
an Aluminum RIA.

The Ni-plated Dukoffs are fairly easy to spot.  They look better than their
Silverite versions.  The exterior is un-pitted and holds up better over
time.  Even the unplated inside looks better than some of the older ones.

You can usually see the plating edge where it meets the table.  In fact,
some is usually hanging past the edge on new ones.
