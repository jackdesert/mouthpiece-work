            <pre class='message__body'>I was first introduced to Delrin as a kid running slot cars.  There were
axle bushings and gears (with beautifully cut teeth) made from Delrin.
Even in recent years, the gears in radio controlled model helicopters
have Delrin gears... and these are transferring 1 to 2 hp.  Delrin&#39;s
self lubricating properties make it very easy to machine, from what I am
told, it doesn&#39;t melt and gum up on the cutting tools.

Stainless takes special skills and tools to cut, and is out of the realm
of most home workshops.  Even commercially, there are very few stainless
mouthpieces.  The preferred material seems to be brass with chrome
plating for metal mouthpieces.

Many mouthpieces that are assumed to be hard rubber are not, they are
ABS, which is not a great material for mouthpieces, in my opinion.

So far, I have only worked on one SS MP.  It was an older Runyon and 
it was not too bad to work on.  Probably not as hard as some 
Stainless Steels.  I had to reshape the tip curve using a 1/4" fine 
metal file.  I refaced it open some to get some tip rail width, then 
I thinned the tip rail with strips of sandpaper wrapped around my 
favorite 1/2 round file shape.  The SS was hard, but this just 
required that I use one grade coarser sandpaper than I would normally 
use for the facing, etc.  220 for heavy cutting instead of 320.  320 
instead of 400 normal shaping.  400 instead of 600 for fine work.  
600 instead of croucus cloth for final work.  I did not do any 
chamber work so I did not need any other special tools.  

Its nothing special, but I put a photo of it in the tenor sax photo 
section here at the MouthpieceWork group site.  Because the original 
chamber was blackened, you can see where I had to sand the baffle to 
thin the tip rail.

The file set I use is #60526 from Micro-Mark ($14.95).  Its a set of 
10 "Coarse" needle files.  The 1/2 round file that tapers to a point 
is the best all-around shape.  There 2-3 other shapes that also get 
used for some chamber and side rail work.  The rest are not needed, 
but at $15, who cares?  For SS work I would think harder files are 
needed.  Perhaps the Micro-Mark #80741 ($32.95) would probably be a 
good choice, but I have not tried them.  Its a 5 file set made of 
Tungsten Carbide.  This may be the only set you would need to buy for 
all materials.  Be sure to get a File Card too.  Micro-Mark has them 
and I saw the same one recently at Home Depot for a little less.

A Rifler file comes in handy too.  I have one I got from my Father-in-
law.  A full set may be more than you would need.

I&#39;ve worked on a couple of plated brass pieces.  I really enjoyed 
it.  They filed and sanded easily and polished up real nice.  Hard 
rubber and plastic take a lot of work to get out scratches from your 
file work.  The plastic used for Rico Royal Metalite mouthpieces is 
very hard.  Seemed much tougher to cut than brass!

Santy commented to me once those were difficult to work.


"Be sure to get a File Card too.  Micro-Mark has them

I got mine from Ferree&#39;s... YES, a necessary item!

> A Rifler file comes in handy too.

Micromark has these, too.

"Hard rubber and plastic take a lot of work to get out scratches from
your file work."

I go over the filed baffle with first 600 paper, then 800 to remove file
marks.  Then I use a little tool Santy told me how to make.  I use a
3/8" wood dowel, cutting a flat on one end about 1" long.  Using CA Gel
("superglue" gel), I glue on a piece of 1/16" cork, and over that, a
piece of chamois.  So, now I have a nice little polishing tool with a
handle.  Nothing on it is hard enough to scratch the plastic or hard
rubber.  I use a plastic polishing compound sold at Autozone called
Scratch-Out, by Kit.  This is sold for polishing plexiglass faceplates
on motorcycle helmets, plexiglass windshields, and other plastics.  I
put a little dab of this on the chamois, and a drop of water, and polish
the filed and sanded area.  This makes my work nearly invisible.  For a
final polish on the table and rails, I turn a piece of 600 or 800 paper
over, paper side up, and polish the table and rails on the backside.
There is just enough silica dust impregnated in the paper to put a nice
shine on the table.  Use very light pressure on the side and tip rails.

The Kit Scratch-Out can also be used, just applied with a soft rag and
buffing by hand, to really shine up an older mouthpiece.  I do this for
a nice, professional looking finish to any mouthpiece work I do.

Me too.  I had a custom silver plated Yamaha alto neck for a while but it
played the same as my stock neck so I sold it.  I did not want people to
think it was the neck that made me sound decent.  I usually avoid colored
mouthpieces for the same reason.  I had a gold plated Ponzol neck too, but
it had noticably different dimensions.

Ya notice that no one markets necks and headjoints made out of el cheapo
materials.  How about chrome plated cast iron?  At least there are some
inexpensive mouthpiece choices.

acoustical foundations of music: musical sound: a lucid account of its 
properties, production, behavior, and reproduction."  published by 
norton.  for a quick excerpt, see page 234 where states that "The 
material from which brass instruments are made has generally been 
considered to have an important influence on its tone; in fact, the term 
"brassy" implies a certain tone quality.  However, opinion on this 
matter has been divided, as is usually the case.  One investigator made 
a trumpet of wood; according to his report, it had a tone that could not 
be told from that of a brass trumpet when both were sounded behind a 
screen."  

This is easily one of the best list groups i ever had the pleasure of 
participating.

            <pre class='message__body'>OK I agree to disagree ;~)

Actually soldered vs. non-soldered tone holes makes a significant difference, but that has to do with the shape of the tone hole edges, the shape of the walls and certain deformations that take place in the tube during extrusion. Ditto the effect of open holes vs. closed holes. The open holes add compliance due to the extra space, and the sound waves are affected by hitting the pads of the players fingers, plus the extra edge of the hole. Not to mention the different venting and impedance and changes in the lattice cutoff frequency caused by the extra holes.

It is also true that different materials feel different and cause the player to play quite differently in an unconscious feedback loop. This can make a big difference in the final sound. Call it an indirect effect of wall materials. 

Now let&#39;s not go into the non-effect of different wall thickness of the same material :~0

An interesting point about scientific instruments is that they can be made to respond in different ranges. Humans can detect pitch changes of a few cents, and loudness changes of about 3dB. Scientific instruments can be made to discern differences many orders of magnitude smaller. 

What scientific instruments cannot do is to integrate all the data they collect into a synthesized whole. That is up to the scientists who use them, and I would be the first to admit that what we know and can do consciously is only a small drop in the bucket compared to what we know and do unconsciously. And scientists must proceed very conservatively to make sure that they have analytical control of what they study. It is possible that they have just not caught up yet at some level, as they have to drag a lot of extra baggage around, albeit very powerful baggage.

To be honest I would be overjoyed if science discovered a meta-realm of acoustics that proved that things like cryogenic treatment, material, magnetization, angel&#39;s blessings or whatever did have some bearing. It could happen. At present the scientists in the field, who are not dumb people and are bringing all their very sophisticated techniques and instruments to the task, cannot find a chink in the armor of physical laws. In fact every time they set up controlled experiments (like Coltman&#39;s) they show that people and scientific instruments both are unable to discern differences in response due to materials.

The seminal question is: do you believe in magic?

Best,

Toby

  Toby,
  Lets agree to disagree, I have tried various heads on the same body, different combinations of materials etc. I have a wooden head join there that does indeed sound very different to silver head joint which in turn sounds very different to a gold head joint. There is difference in embouchure holes as well, more difference than can be found in the materials the instrument is made from. The differences that a player feels to be huge differences are perhaps not as obvious to the listener. The differences that are apparent on the playing end change the physical way you play a given instrument. 

  I also suppose that soldered and non soldered tone holes make no difference to the sound of a flute either? I have found that there is a difference in how the tone holes are formed in how a flute plays, same with a sax. Perhaps these differences aren&#39;t able to measured by electronics. I also don&#39;t totally believe in the infallibility of electronics and scientific measurements either as the sensitivity of the human ear, within the hearing range is pretty astonishing. There is also a difference in open hole and closed hole flutes in how they feel and respond to the player, sonically there is very little difference though.

  I also prefer the sound of silver on the neck area of a sax, wether plated or solid, it adds more focus to the sound of a given sax. I have proved this to myself on more than one occasion with different saxophones too. I experimented with a Selmer Bari neck, I played it as a lacquered neck, I then stripped the neck and then I silver plated the same neck. The bare brass was significantly more vibrant than the lacquer and the silver plate was better again. The differences between the bare brass and the silver where less pronounced than between the lacquer and the bare brass. I am talking about how the sound of the instrument is to the player behind the instrument.

    I have an Almeida handmade and a Powell handmade silver flute. the tubes are identical in diameter--the heads are interchangeable. The two headjoints are very close as far as I can measure with my vernier calipers. The Almeida is a classic old Powell style head with a rectangular embouchure hole. The Powell head is a Cooper style. The difference is like night and day. There are significant differences in the way the bodies take air and respond as well, which is quite remarkable when you think that these are two cylinders with identical diameters.

    With differences like those in two flutes of the same materials I don&#39;t know how anyone can claim to tell the differences caused by the materials. This was also the conclusion in the flute test I mentioned a few posts back.

    You say that it takes more air to make a gold flute "resonate". What does that mean? The total expansion of a flute tube caused by pressure waves in the bore is well under a millionth of a meter. It is the air vibrating in the tube that causes the sound, not the vibrations of the tube.

    I&#39;ve played quite a few flutes in different materials too and I&#39;ve never noticed any consistent differences that couldn&#39;t be attributed to variances in internal dimensions.

    I&#39;m not saying that the materials make no difference, only that the difference is several orders of magnitude below what most folks think.

    So I guess I also have to agree to disagree on this with you too ;~)

      Toby,
      There is a difference between wood and the various other material flutes are made of. I have played these model that you speak of and I am not a fan of Haynes, they sound good up to a point but a good Muramatsu sounds as good and probably is a little darker. I have played several $40,000 gold flutes and they do take more air to get resonating than does an identical model in solid silver. Silver does respond faster than does gold in terms of a flute body. Platinum feels and plays differently again to both gold and silver. I am fortunate enough to have access to well known flute maker who has many of the head joints and flutes at hand. Personally I love the sound and feel of Gold flutes ( I can&#39;t afford one though) so I use a solid silver Muramatsu with a solid gold tube platinum lip and riser head joint. I also have a solid silver head joint for this same flute, the sound difference between these two head joints is dramatic. I also have a solid silver head platinum lip and riser head joint to which responds very differently to the gold tube head joint. I also have a wooden head joint for this same flute. Each head joint changes the way these flutes behave and play. These are just my own flutes, I have also played many more different flutes.

      There is a difference in playing of these various materials of flute. These differences that are apparent to the player may not show up as readily in a lab test. I may try this at home here and use a spectrum analysis program. I will post the results. A = 440Hz and A = 880Hz..

      Scientific or psuedo scientific studies are well and good but in the end it comes down to what a given performer feels most comfortable with when performing. We mustn&#39;t lose sight of the big picture here for the details.

      A metal mpc does indeed respond differently to a Hard Rubber model which again is different to a plastic model.

        I have to respectfully disagree Bootman. At present I have two handmade silver flutes, and in the past have owned or played a number of good Boehm flutes in silver, gold, wood and early plated handmade French flutes. I found nothing that could have been attributable to the material rather than the chimney height, undercut angle, tube smoothness and diameter, head dimensions, etc. It&#39;s a myth pure and simple that the material affects the tone, and everyone has bought into it and perpetuates it. I had a Grenadilla Haynes that played much more like my silver Haynes than my silver Haynes played like my present Powell flute. 

        I think the link I provided earlier to the Coltman paper in the Marl collection at Stanford might make interesting reading for you. I think most of the differences that players find between flutes of different materials is what they expect to find.

        Yours,

          A gold Flute does play quite differently from a silver flute. The material and cut of the embouchure has a more significant effect on the tone, as does the material that the Chimney is made from. Gold, Platinum and silver all respond differently when you play them on a Flute, there is a noticeable difference in resistance to the player.

          Material of mpcs also does make a difference, I have experienced the same things Paul describes with the Quantum mpcs. I have even had a Bronzite model made up as well, an exact replica of a Quantum and it plays differently to the Delrin and the Metal model.

            The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is effectively the thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It can only flex perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the center which causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive studies of reeds on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the tip--no other movement of any significance. There is some question about how long the closed part of the cycle lasts.

            Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might have some effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some flexing in the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3 dB due to this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking small potatoes compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior. 

            As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic science circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material makes a significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming "rich" tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to all be hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection on the subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials in other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and pianos, where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

            Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame. Compression waves in the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the instrument are only there to define a shape for the air so that it can vibrate effectively. To say that walls change the sound--assuming they are sufficiently rigid and smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle barrel affects how far a bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two barrels are identical in dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under the pressure of the expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the trajectory of the projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with instrument bodies. Ad mouthpieces.

              What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As the reed 
              vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply rolling 
              closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

              Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the tip 
              first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of course, still 
              on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip slightly, then 
              as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of the reed, 
              causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed opening up 
              again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what if" type 
              of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

              Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown what the 
              exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to my 
              speculative pondering or not?

  OK I agree to disagree ;~)

  Actually soldered vs. non-soldered tone holes makes a significant
difference, but that has to do with the shape of the tone hole edges, the
shape of the walls and certain deformations that take place in the tube
during extrusion. Ditto the effect of open holes vs. closed holes. The open
holes add compliance due to the extra space, and the sound waves are
affected by hitting the pads of the players fingers, plus the extra edge of
the hole. Not to mention the different venting and impedance and changes in
the lattice cutoff frequency caused by the extra holes.

  It is also true that different materials feel different and cause the
player to play quite differently in an unconscious feedback loop. This can
make a big difference in the final sound. Call it an indirect effect of wall
materials.

  Now let&#39;s not go into the non-effect of different wall thickness of the
same material :~0

  An interesting point about scientific instruments is that they can be made
to respond in different ranges. Humans can detect pitch changes of a few
cents, and loudness changes of about 3dB. Scientific instruments can be made
to discern differences many orders of magnitude smaller.

  What scientific instruments cannot do is to integrate all the data they
collect into a synthesized whole. That is up to the scientists who use them,
and I would be the first to admit that what we know and can do consciously
is only a small drop in the bucket compared to what we know and do
unconsciously. And scientists must proceed very conservatively to make sure
that they have analytical control of what they study. It is possible that
they have just not caught up yet at some level, as they have to drag a lot
of extra baggage around, albeit very powerful baggage.

  To be honest I would be overjoyed if science discovered a meta-realm of
acoustics that proved that things like cryogenic treatment, material,
magnetization, angel&#39;s blessings or whatever did have some bearing. It could
happen. At present the scientists in the field, who are not dumb people and
are bringing all their very sophisticated techniques and instruments to the
task, cannot find a chink in the armor of physical laws. In fact every time
they set up controlled experiments (like Coltman&#39;s) they show that people
and scientific instruments both are unable to discern differences in
response due to materials.

  The seminal question is: do you believe in magic?

  Best,

  Toby

    Toby,
    Lets agree to disagree, I have tried various heads on the same body,
different combinations of materials etc. I have a wooden head join there
that does indeed sound very different to silver head joint which in turn
sounds very different to a gold head joint. There is difference in
embouchure holes as well, more difference than can be found in the materials
the instrument is made from. The differences that a player feels to be huge
differences are perhaps not as obvious to the listener. The differences that
are apparent on the playing end change the physical way you play a given
instrument.

    I also suppose that soldered and non soldered tone holes make no
difference to the sound of a flute either? I have found that there is a
difference in how the tone holes are formed in how a flute plays, same with
a sax. Perhaps these differences aren&#39;t able to measured by electronics. I
also don&#39;t totally believe in the infallibility of electronics and
scientific measurements either as the sensitivity of the human ear, within
the hearing range is pretty astonishing. There is also a difference in open
hole and closed hole flutes in how they feel and respond to the player,
sonically there is very little difference though.

    I also prefer the sound of silver on the neck area of a sax, wether
plated or solid, it adds more focus to the sound of a given sax. I have
proved this to myself on more than one occasion with different saxophones
too. I experimented with a Selmer Bari neck, I played it as a lacquered
neck, I then stripped the neck and then I silver plated the same neck. The
bare brass was significantly more vibrant than the lacquer and the silver
plate was better again. The differences between the bare brass and the
silver where less pronounced than between the lacquer and the bare brass. I
am talking about how the sound of the instrument is to the player behind the
instrument.

      I have an Almeida handmade and a Powell handmade silver flute. the
tubes are identical in diameter--the heads are interchangeable. The two
headjoints are very close as far as I can measure with my vernier calipers.
The Almeida is a classic old Powell style head with a rectangular embouchure
hole. The Powell head is a Cooper style. The difference is like night and
day. There are significant differences in the way the bodies take air and
respond as well, which is quite remarkable when you think that these are two
cylinders with identical diameters.

      With differences like those in two flutes of the same materials I
don&#39;t know how anyone can claim to tell the differences caused by the
materials. This was also the conclusion in the flute test I mentioned a few
posts back.

      You say that it takes more air to make a gold flute "resonate". What
does that mean? The total expansion of a flute tube caused by pressure waves
in the bore is well under a millionth of a meter. It is the air vibrating in
the tube that causes the sound, not the vibrations of the tube.

      I&#39;ve played quite a few flutes in different materials too and I&#39;ve
never noticed any consistent differences that couldn&#39;t be attributed to
variances in internal dimensions.

      I&#39;m not saying that the materials make no difference, only that the
difference is several orders of magnitude below what most folks think.

      So I guess I also have to agree to disagree on this with you too ;~)

        Toby,
        There is a difference between wood and the various other material
flutes are made of. I have played these model that you speak of and I am not
a fan of Haynes, they sound good up to a point but a good Muramatsu sounds
as good and probably is a little darker. I have played several $40,000 gold
flutes and they do take more air to get resonating than does an identical
model in solid silver. Silver does respond faster than does gold in terms of
a flute body. Platinum feels and plays differently again to both gold and
silver. I am fortunate enough to have access to well known flute maker who
has many of the head joints and flutes at hand. Personally I love the sound
and feel of Gold flutes ( I can&#39;t afford one though) so I use a solid silver
Muramatsu with a solid gold tube platinum lip and riser head joint. I also
have a solid silver head joint for this same flute, the sound difference
between these two head joints is dramatic. I also have a solid silver head
platinum lip and riser head joint to which responds very differently to the
gold tube head joint. I also have a wooden head joint for this same flute.
Each head joint changes the way these flutes behave and play. These are just
my own flutes, I have also played many more different flutes.

        There is a difference in playing of these various materials of
flute. These differences that are apparent to the player may not show up as
readily in a lab test. I may try this at home here and use a spectrum
analysis program. I will post the results. A = 440Hz and A = 880Hz..

        Scientific or psuedo scientific studies are well and good but in the
end it comes down to what a given performer feels most comfortable with when
performing. We mustn&#39;t lose sight of the big picture here for the details.

        A metal mpc does indeed respond differently to a Hard Rubber model
which again is different to a plastic model.

          I have to respectfully disagree Bootman. At present I have two
handmade silver flutes, and in the past have owned or played a number of
good Boehm flutes in silver, gold, wood and early plated handmade French
flutes. I found nothing that could have been attributable to the material
rather than the chimney height, undercut angle, tube smoothness and
diameter, head dimensions, etc. It&#39;s a myth pure and simple that the
material affects the tone, and everyone has bought into it and perpetuates
it. I had a Grenadilla Haynes that played much more like my silver Haynes
than my silver Haynes played like my present Powell flute.

          I think the link I provided earlier to the Coltman paper in the
Marl collection at Stanford might make interesting reading for you. I think
most of the differences that players find between flutes of different
materials is what they expect to find.

          Yours,

          Toby

            A gold Flute does play quite differently from a silver flute.
The material and cut of the embouchure has a more significant effect on the
tone, as does the material that the Chimney is made from. Gold, Platinum and
silver all respond differently when you play them on a Flute, there is a
noticeable difference in resistance to the player.

            Material of mpcs also does make a difference, I have experienced
the same things Paul describes with the Quantum mpcs. I have even had a
Bronzite model made up as well, an exact replica of a Quantum and it plays
differently to the Delrin and the Metal model.

              The reed can&#39;t shrink and expand laterally, as it is
effectively the thickness of the cane from tip to butt in that dimension. It
can only flex perpendicular to the thin axis, or the tip can flex around the
center which causes squeaks. As I remember Backus from USC did extensive
studies of reeds on clarinet mpcs and it seems that they only close the
tip--no other movement of any significance. There is some question about how
long the closed part of the cycle lasts.

              Nederveen suggests that the inertial mass of the mpc might
have some effect on a sax since the flexure of the reed could cause some
flexing in the neck which could affect the embouchure. He posits a max of 3
dB due to this which could be significant. Still and all we are talking
small potatoes compared to the dimensions and configuration of the interior.

              As to Ralph Morgan&#39;s statements: it is well known in acoustic
science circles that almost all players and makers claim that the material
makes a significant difference. Just look at any ad--flute makers claiming
"rich" tone for gold flutes, "bright" tone for silver, etc. It appears to
all be hype, and we all get sucked in without the least critical reflection
on the subject. Partly this is due to the very real effect of wall materials
in other types of musical instruments such as violins and guitars and
pianos, where the vibrations of the material reinforce the vibrations of the
exciting mechanism and to a great extent produce the sound. That&#39;s easy to
see if you compare the sound of a plucked string on an acoustic guitar with
the same string on a solid body electric. Worlds of difference.

              Woodwinds and brass are a whole different ballgame.
Compression waves in the air itself cause the sound, and the walls of the
instrument are only there to define a shape for the air so that it can
vibrate effectively. To say that walls change the sound--assuming they are
sufficiently rigid and smooth--is like saying that the material of a rifle
barrel affects how far a bullet will travel and with what velocity. If two
barrels are identical in dimension and smoothness, and don&#39;t deform under
the pressure of the expanding gasses that propel the bullet then the
trajectory of the projectile is going to be the same. The same thing with
instrument bodies. Ad mouthpieces.

                What about differences in the coefficient of friction? As
the reed
                vibrates there might (?) be more to its movement than simply
rolling
                closed over the facing and rolling back off it (?).

                Is it possible that the reed might actually go closed at the
tip
                first, then close up closer to the butt of the reed (of
course, still
                on the vibrating portion of the reed), sliding the tip
slightly, then
                as it comes back open, opens up first closer to the butt of
the reed,
                causing the tip to slide, followed by the tip of the reed
opening up
                again? Of course, this is just speculative pondering/"what
if" type
                of stuff, but who knows the answers? I sure don&#39;t.

                Does anyone know of any scientific studies that have shown
what the
                exact form of vibration is? Ie: whether there is anything to
my
                speculative pondering or not?

minimal--almost
                unnoticeable. I believe Phil Barone has said the same
thing--that as
                long as the internal dimensions are similar the material
doesn&#39;t
                matter. On the other hand Jon van Wie thinks differently.

Phil has
                that ability and I tend to side with him. Certainly the
acoustical
                scientists would claim to a man that this is the case. They
say that
                very small differences in the dimensions can make a big
difference,
                but that materials of the same smoothness will all sound
alike, as
                long as they are rigid enough not to deform under the
pressure of the
                sound waves generated by the beating reed . There will be
some small
                vibrational deformation of the material caused by the slap
of the
                reed but it is not hard to see that that too is minimal
compared to
                the displacement of the reed tip. There would be a slight
difference
                based on the differing thermal coefficients, but we are
talking about
                absolutely inaudible differences here.
