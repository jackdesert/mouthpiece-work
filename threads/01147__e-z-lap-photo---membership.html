            <pre class='message__body'>I just uploaded a photo of my E-Z Lap in the "Photos, Sanding" 
directory on the Yahoo MouthpieceWork site.

We&#39;ve had a little membership increase.  We are up to 195.  Small, 
but I think we are the 2nd largest Yahoo group in the Sax section.  
The Canonball Sax group is #1.
