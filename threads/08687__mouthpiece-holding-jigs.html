To get at what part of the mouthpiece with what tool on what machine?
For finishing/refacing work, I just hold it.  On the mill, I haven&#39;t figured out anything better than angled v blocks in the vice.  What kind of vise adaptation are you using?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve got a couple of different vises that are used in machine shops that are
a little different than standard configuration. V blocks are OK. The one I
seem to use the most is a Wilton vise designed to be used with a large drill
press. It is flat, has a quite large base, and the jaws are just the right
size. 

 

I do about a half dozen mouthpieces in a typical work day. I always mount
them in a vise when doing baffle or tip work, as well as when I am roughing
in the table.  I usually hold them in my hand when doing facings. I get
better leverage with my files when they are held securely, which cuts down
the physical effort I have to make and since the mouthpiece is held
securely, I can make more precise cuts.
