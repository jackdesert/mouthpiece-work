To the best of my knowledge they will remain back ordered forever 
because Ralph cant get the tip wands.  Most of us newer folks here have 
gathered their tools from various places.  Steve Fowler is now making a 
great tip gauge, you can get the glass gauge from Jim Green at Babbitt, 
then get a set of feeler gauges.  You can get a very nice machined set 
of larger gauges from Jeff Rosner...if he still has any (sjrosner at 
mindspring Dot com).  The small feelers you can get at a auto parts 
store.  Then a thick piece of glass and wet dry sandpaper.  We can 
supply you with a the old Eric Brand manual is avaliable in pdf.  So 
basically you have to scrape around til you get things.  Steve Fowler 
did us a great service by making a tip gauge as you could not find one 
ANYWHERE!  Check Fowler Music on the web.  All this will get you what 
you need and cost you less than the Morgan Kit.  You will also have a 
more complete set of feelers.  Jeff&#39;s sure beat the heck out of 
stacking feelers. The people on this site have made it much easier than 
it would have been otherwise.  Great place.
