            <pre class='message__body'>Yesterday I worked on some of the graftonite soprano mouthpieces. 
First I took the table down as far as possible to decrease the 
chamber volume, and to bring the baffle up. Then I opened it up to 
approximately .80, with a facing length of 16 mm (32 EB). I used an 
arc curve with a flat spot at the tip. I did the same thing to a 
second piece without bringing the table down. The first one (with the 
smaller chamber and higher baffle) played better in tune on my 
Buescher soprano (no difference on my Selmer)and had a somewhat 
fuller sound. So I took the table down on this one as well, and made 
it identical to the first one, except for a little longer flat spot 
at the tip of the facing curve. To me it doesn&#39;t make a noticable 
difference. On a third piece I took the table down, opened it up to 
approximately .95 (!), so that the baffle starts right behind the 
tip. This time a little longer facing of 18mm (36 EB), and again a 
flat spot at the tip of the facing curve. All of these pieces play 
easy for me. The .80 tip openings with Marca 2 reeds, the .95 with 
Marca 1.5. I can play a Fibracell soft on the .80, but it gets a 
little hard after some time. The sound of these pieces, although not 
bad at all (big!), leaves something to be desired compared to my 
favorite mpc. So anyone who wants to try a big tip/short facing on 
soprano can have them. If you like how they play you can experiment 
yourself with epoxy and different chamber shapes.
On the remaining two pieces I will probably experiment with different 
facing lengths and a moderate (original) tip opening (.65).

Henk

Henk, I&#39;d really like to try these mouthpieces.  Please email me directly.

Thanks!
