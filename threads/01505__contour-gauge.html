I am having a little trouble "seeing" baffles and I think this would
help immensely! It wouldn&#39;t work as well for the lay but for the
baffle I know of no other way to really measure the beast...

            <pre class='message__body'>I used one for a while.  I would take caliper measurements of a mouthpiece
wherever I could.  On the back of my data sheet I would trace the profile
of the baffle centerline (taken through the window) with the contour gauge.

The trace is very crude, took time, and I ended up never using them.  There
just is no fast, easy, accurate, inexpensive way to capture the shapes
inside a mouthpiece.  The best I can do is take a few caliper measurments
on the length and depth of a wedge, step, or bullet baffle.  I eyeball the
interior and make some general notes on what I see.

If anyone has some good methods for this area, I&#39;d like to hear them too.

            <pre class='message__body'>   the problem is how does one  recreate the baffle of a 
mouthpiece. what i ended up doing was buying a contour gauge 
from micromark , copying the baffle of a favourite mouthpiece 
from the contour gauge onto a piece of paper ,and then 
re-copying from the paper onto a piece of 3mm 
lexan(plexiglass). i then cut out the baffle shape leaving a little 
extra on the contour line .the next thing i did was to slowly 
remove matierial  from the lexan until it finally matched up to the 
baffle. some things i found usefull : (1)  when using the contour 
gauge take an impression of the full length of the mouthpiece 
down the center. (2) make the lexan follow this whole contour 
impression ,from the table to the tip.(3) at the  tip  end in a hook 
shape so it lines  up  with the tip of a mouthpiece.
this is a time consuming process  so i&#39;ve only done this with a 
few  baffles which i thought  to be some of the best  i&#39;ve 
encountered.
     this isn&#39;t the most  scientific method  but  i  think it helps me to 
be on the right track  to produce a good baffle shape.

anyway , thats my 2 cents
