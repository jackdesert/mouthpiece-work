            <pre class='message__body'>Hello,

Sorry for this simple and uninteresting question but please help me 
with the following: I have a dozen of older barrel chamber MPs that 
came with my vintage horns I collected and most of them have nicks, 
burrs, scratches, etc. on the rails as a result of time, use and 
careless storage.

What is the simplest method to merely restore the rails without intent 
to reface (change parameters of the MP) the pieces? If I use a flat 
surface, such as a ground glass and some fine sandpaper and carefully 
sand the rails so that all scratches go away will it work?
If I carefully follow the current MP facing shape while sanding the 
table is there anything to worry about?
Will I need any "advanced" tools such as that transparent ruler and 
feeler gauges for this work?
What are some pitfalls I may not be aware of? The last is a very naive 
question I guess :)

I have successfully used super glue to fill cracks or gouges and then, very carefully just sanded that off.  It works as long as you take your time.  John

            <pre class='message__body'>Super glues, aka CA glues, aka Cyanoacrylates, have been used for emergency expedient wound closure.  There are other medical uses.
   
  http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2187/was-super-glue-invented-to-seal-battle-wounds-in-vietnam
   
  "As a result, in 1998 the FDA approved 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for use in closing wounds and surgical incisions, and in 2001 approved it for use as a "barrier against common bacterial microbes including certain staphylococci, pseudomonads, and Escherichia coli" (reference 2). This latest incarnation was marketed under the name Traumaseal as well as the more popular Dermabond. 
   
  "Cyanoacrylate glues also find use in medicine for orthopedic surgery, dental and oral medicine (marketed as Soothe-n-Seal), veterinary medicine (Nexaband), and for home use as Band Aid brand Liquid Bandage. It even has been explored as a potential treatment for emphysema, where it can be used to seal off diseased lung passages without the need for invasive surgery."

            <pre class='message__body'> Cyanoacrylates have many uses in medicine. I have used them in my 
dental practice for many years primarily for temporary repairs-it is 
quite soluable in saliva. A repair only lasts about 2-3 weeks before 
dissolving and breaking. With that in mind, it probably is not a good 
choice for mouthpiece repairs. An acrylic filler is a better choice.
  As far as toxicity, given that it washes out so quickly, it is 
something I don&#39;t recommend. Remember, it is my profession that 
insisted for years mercury/amalgam fillings were safe.......

Thanks for a warning, I haven&#39;t found anything useful on the subject 
in below messages except for an advice to use superglue. Thanks for 
that but I honestly don&#39;t like such repairs as I&#39;m sort of more of a 
purist.

If I&#39;m faced with refacing anyway, what would be the correct 
procedure to follow keeping in mind I don&#39;t want to change the MP 
facing but simply to restore it? Is this task feasible at all?

Suppose I had a talent, or luck, or precise machinery to take off 
some HR from the rails but completely following the original MP 
facing shape until the deepest scratch disappeared. Let&#39;s assume I&#39;ve 
taken off no more then 0.2 mm. What else would have to be done to 
bring the MP to normal playing condition?

Please try to answer the question as if you were doing it yourself 
and not trying to send me to an experienced refacer or make me forget 
about my idea altogether.
Thanks!

be to send it to a pro if you want to save the mouthpiece.

I agree with John.  You said you have a lot of these, so you can pick some to practice on or get some junk plastic clarinet mouthpieces to practice on.  Obtain a glass gage and a set of feeler gages.  A tip gage or/calipers.  Practice measuring facings until you get consistent results.  
 
See the Files area on the MouthpieceWork Yahoo site for the list of reworking steps and suggested tools.  You will need a flat work surface (glass plate), a selection if fine grit sandpapers, and probably a small half-round needle file.
 
Someone with experience or "the knack" probably could take shortcuts and do the job with a sandpaper and a countertop.  But there is added risk when you do not use the tools of the trade and do not take the time to develop the needed skills.

The only accurate way as I see it would be to measure the mouthpiece as it is and then, depending upon the depth of the gouges or scratches, take that same amount from the table.  Then duplicate the facing on the lay and finish off the tip rail to the original thickness.  If you are careful, it will be very close to the original but never exactly the same.  John

Thanks for a warning, I haven&#39;t found anything useful on the subject 
in below messages except for an advice to use superglue. Thanks for 
that but I honestly don&#39;t like such repairs as I&#39;m sort of more of a 
purist.

If I&#39;m faced with refacing anyway, what would be the correct 
procedure to follow keeping in mind I don&#39;t want to change the MP 
facing but simply to restore it? Is this task feasible at all?

Suppose I had a talent, or luck, or precise machinery to take off 
some HR from the rails but completely following the original MP 
facing shape until the deepest scratch disappeared. Let&#39;s assume I&#39;ve 
taken off no more then 0.2 mm. What else would have to be done to 
bring the MP to normal playing condition?

Please try to answer the question as if you were doing it yourself 
and not trying to send me to an experienced refacer or make me forget 
about my idea altogether.
Thanks!
