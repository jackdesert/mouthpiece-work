            <pre class='message__body'>  I&#39;m doing some research for an article I&#39;m writing, and can&#39;t find an
answer to this question:
 
HOW DID WE END UP WITH THE REED SIZES (PHYSICAL SIZE, NOT STRENGTH) THAT WE

speculation. This information has eluded me so far!

There&#39;s also a negative side."    Hunter S. Thompson
