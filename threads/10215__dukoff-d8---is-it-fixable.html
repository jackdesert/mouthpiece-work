            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Dukoff D8 - Is it fixable?</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>I have a Dukoff D8 that belongs to the university I attend. I think it was purchased in the 70&#39;s. Just from looking at it, I am guessing that some time down the line, someone dropped it and took tools to it without really knowing what they were doing. The tip on the right side is a lot farther back and the right side rail has a lot less material. I will try to add some pictures so you can see what I am talking about. 

I am pretty new to refacing (still working on getting all the tools), but here is my question: 

Should I try and build up the right side and the tip with JD Weld (or the like) and then sand it even or wok on dropping the left side to match the right side?

Thanks for your input.

            <pre class='message__body'>It depends on the extremity of the damage. If it&#39;s only slight, you can fix this with semi-normal refacing methods, although it&#39;ll probably never been exactly the same since it seems like someone attempted (very unevenly) to fix it. I wouldn&#39;t bother with building up a bunch of JB Weld to try and fix it. JB Weld is amazing for fixing cracked off tips and building up tip chips (large and small) where material is missing, but if it is just bent or the mouthpiece has been completely hacked at with a file so much that one side is a lot shorter than the other, it&#39;s not really worth the trouble. But it&#39;s tough to judge what you mean without some pictures. Maybe it&#39;s different than I&#39;m thinking.

This is exactly the kind of mouthpiece, though, that would be great to start with if you&#39;re new to refacing!

            <pre class='message__body'>Not at all. In fact, there is just a new study published which shows unexpectedly high levels of BPA from canned soups, since cans use an epoxy sealant. Steve Howard wrote to the makers of JB, and they eventually said that it should not be used in any way that it comes into contact with the mouth. Making a baffle out of it is one thing; using it for repairing a tip rail or beak entirely another.

Dental epoxies are made without BPA. cyanoacrylates become totally inert after curing; epoxies not.

Industry has been saying for years that nominal exposure to BPA is harmless, new research is challenging that claim. It should be noted that BPA, being an estrogen mimic, is particularly bad for males, especially during childhood, and xeroestrogens have been linked to declining sperm counts and testicular cancer. Use at your own risk.

Strangely, this article goes into somewhat more depth on the health
concerns of BPA than the industry sponsored site www.factsaboutbpa.org.
