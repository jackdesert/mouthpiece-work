            <pre class='message__body'>The difference in using the US vs Metric... the mm markings are .03937"
apart.  The US gauge has markings of .040".  This is discussed in the
manual from the Madison Enterprises kit.  Those glass gauges have .040"
markings.

For all practical purposes, they will give identical results.

Facing lengths were designated, in the old Eric Brand manual, by numbers
that were on half mm markings.  That is, a facing length of 20 mm would
be 40 half mm&#39;s, and would be a facing length of 40.

It was felt by Eric Brand, and from experience, I agree, that 1/2 mm is
more than close enough to define any point on the facing vs a feeler
thickness.  And by using his system, halves or decimals were avoided.

So, a facing length of an alto sax that was 19.5 mm would be designated
a 39.

Back to mm vs US.  The markings on the Madison glass gauge is in .040"
increments.  You simply double the number for an equivilent in the Eric
Brand system, if that is what you want.

Now, the facing length vs feeler, this is the distance from the tip that
a feeler of X thickness can be slid under the glass to where it stops.
So, you are going roundabout to define where the facing curve is in
relation to a flat plane, the plane of the table, the undersurface of
the glass.  So, in defining this curve, it makes very little difference,
certainly not within what we can produce by our meager methods, whether
the increments on the glass are .040" apart, or .03937" (1" = 25.4mm, or
1 mm = .03937").

Also, I discussed this with John Winslow...  for the thinnest feeler,
the "1 and a half thousandths" (.0015"), this is used to measure the
facing length, the total length.  It has been the standard for many,
many years.  But this .0015" feeler is very thin, easy to wrinkle.  If
you get a wrinkle in it, it is junk, useless.  So, get a couple of
these.

But John sent me a .0020" feeler.  This is more resistant to damage, and
gives very nearly the same reading as the .0015".  Just FYI.

The original Eric Brand kit had only 5 feelers, up to .050"  This was
fine for the days when mouthpeices were fairly narrow.  Today, I find
the 9 feelers supplied in the Madison Enterprises kit to be necessary.
This includes .063", .077", and .094" feelers.  Also, this kit has a
.048" instead of .050" feeler, but this is insignificant.

You say you ended up with some slight differences in thickness, such as
.0095 vs .010, or .079 vs .077.  This will not really affect the
readings you get when measuring from the tip.  So, you are in good shape
there.

You can get a great dial caliper from www.micromark.com for about $35.
A digital is a little more.

You can get some great files from Micromark, too.

So, it sounds like we are both on the same page!

Back to Eric Brand... he had a system for designating a facing.  It used
a 5 digit system.  The first two digits were the facing length in half
mm&#39;s.  So, a number of 44xxx would have a facing length of 22 mm&#39;s.

The last three digits were metric, too.  A tip opening of 2.10 mm&#39;s
would be 210 in his system.  So, a facing for a tenor sax could be
defined as 44210.  It would have a length of 22 mm&#39;s, and a tip opening
of 2.10 mm.  ( 2.10 divided by 25.4 = .083" )  So much for the "serial
number" on many mouthpieces.  Some were serial numbers.  Most were Eric
Brand facing numbers.
