            <pre class='message__body'>The difference in using the US vs Metric... the mm markings are .03937"
apart.  The US gauge has markings of .040".  This is discussed in the
manual from the Madison Enterprises kit.  Those glass gauges have .040"
markings.

For all practical purposes, they will give identical results.

Facing lengths were designated, in the old Eric Brand manual, by numbers
that were on half mm markings.  That is, a facing length of 20 mm would
be 40 half mm&#39;s, and would be a facing length of 40.

It was felt by Eric Brand, and from experience, I agree, that 1/2 mm is
more than close enough to define any point on the facing vs a feeler
thickness.  And by using his system, halves or decimals were avoided.

So, a facing length of an alto sax that was 19.5 mm would be designated
a 39.

Back to mm vs US.  The markings on the Madison glass gauge is in .040"
increments.  You simply double the number for an equivilent in the Eric
Brand system, if that is what you want.

Now, the facing length vs feeler, this is the distance from the tip that
a feeler of X thickness can be slid under the glass to where it stops.
So, you are going roundabout to define where the facing curve is in
relation to a flat plane, the plane of the table, the undersurface of
the glass.  So, in defining this curve, it makes very little difference,
certainly not within what we can produce by our meager methods, whether
the increments on the glass are .040" apart, or .03937" (1" = 25.4mm, or
1 mm = .03937").

Also, I discussed this with John Winslow...  for the thinnest feeler,
the "1 and a half thousandths" (.0015"), this is used to measure the
facing length, the total length.  It has been the standard for many,
many years.  But this .0015" feeler is very thin, easy to wrinkle.  If
you get a wrinkle in it, it is junk, useless.  So, get a couple of
these.

But John sent me a .0020" feeler.  This is more resistant to damage, and
gives very nearly the same reading as the .0015".  Just FYI.

The original Eric Brand kit had only 5 feelers, up to .050"  This was
fine for the days when mouthpeices were fairly narrow.  Today, I find
the 9 feelers supplied in the Madison Enterprises kit to be necessary.
This includes .063", .077", and .094" feelers.  Also, this kit has a
.048" instead of .050" feeler, but this is insignificant.

You say you ended up with some slight differences in thickness, such as
.0095 vs .010, or .079 vs .077.  This will not really affect the
readings you get when measuring from the tip.  So, you are in good shape
there.

You can get a great dial caliper from www.micromark.com for about $35.
A digital is a little more.

You can get some great files from Micromark, too.

So, it sounds like we are both on the same page!

Back to Eric Brand... he had a system for designating a facing.  It used
a 5 digit system.  The first two digits were the facing length in half
mm&#39;s.  So, a number of 44xxx would have a facing length of 22 mm&#39;s.

The last three digits were metric, too.  A tip opening of 2.10 mm&#39;s
would be 210 in his system.  So, a facing for a tenor sax could be
defined as 44210.  It would have a length of 22 mm&#39;s, and a tip opening
of 2.10 mm.  ( 2.10 divided by 25.4 = .083" )  So much for the "serial
number" on many mouthpieces.  Some were serial numbers.  Most were Eric
Brand facing numbers.

            <pre class='message__body'>Nice post.  I think we are really laying down the basics.

The metric vs inches scale is not a big deal.  A significant 
difference will only show up on a long tenor or bari sax facing.  a 
2" long facing would be 50.8 (~51) on one scale and 50 on the other.  
If the rails are even, a player may only barely notice the difference.

Speaking of even rails.  When I take my mesurements, I write down the 
left and right numbers if the rails are uneven.  I even split hairs 
and record them to the nearest 1/2 number.  It is not too difficult 
and I find it easier than agonizing whether to round it up or down 
when it appears right in the middle.

For example, here are the measurements I get for the Vandoren B46 
clarinet mouthpiece I played on for over 15 years:

.0015: 36/35
.0050: 29.5/28.5
.0095: 23.5/23
.0165: 17.5/17
.0245: 12 (both sides even)
.0330: 7

Tip opening: .045" (vs .044 published)
Tip rail width: .023"

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, the numbers I listed would be 1/2 mm.  The lines etched into my 
mm gauge each represent 1 mm, but each line represents 2 numbers.  
They are label every 5 lines as follows: 10, 20, 30 ... up to 70.

I goofed in my last post on the 51 vs 50 comparison.  The Inch scale 
used by Winslow would read 25 for a 2" facing length.  The mm scale 
used by Brand would read 50.8 = ~51.

So, when I read to the nearest 1/2 number on the mm scale, I&#39;m 
actually reading to the nearest .25 mm.

When working on some mouthpieces, I have actually tried to get even 
finer.  I&#39;ll put a "+" or "-" on the number if I think it is in the 
cracks between the 1/2 numbers.  This is not neccessary for good 
work, but I find it easier than rounding or recording to the nearest 
1/4 number.  It may help when working on smaller mouthpieces, or it 
may be overkill.

No, on the Winslow gauge, a 1" facing length would read 25.  On the
brand metric system, it would be 50.8.  Still, insignificant as far as
the curve of the facing.  In this, I am talking about the distance from
a particular point on the curve, X distance from the tip.  The deviation
from the plane of the table at X distance, measured with either scale,
would be so close as to make no difference in the playing of the
mouthpiece.

My point is, either the Metric or the .040" increment glass gauge will
do equally well, and can be compared interchangeably for all practical
purposes.

So, we need to make sure when we describe these readings we are using E.
Brand numbers, or mm&#39;s (which should be considered equiv to .040"
increments).  So, we measure a facing length, using the .0015" feeler,
on a tenor sax mouthpiece.  We need to specify that it is 22 mm&#39;s, or
that it is 44 E.Brand.

I would write this at the top of the facing schedule, such as:

Runyon Custom #8

Feeler (")        mm&#39;s
.0015"            22
.010"                18
.014"                16.5
.024"                14
.031"                 11
.048"                7
.063"                5
.077"                3
Tip Opening    .098"

Or

Runyon Custom #8

Feeler (")       E. Brand
.0015"            44
.010"                36
.014"                33

Tip Opening    250

This mpce would be designated 44250 in the E. Brand facing numbering
system.

Conversion back to Winslow or other numbers:
44/2 = 22 mm&#39;s (or 22 on the .040" increment gauge)
250, this is 2.5mm / 25.4 mm per inch = .0984"

So, we can do it both ways, we just need to specify.  Whichever you use,
stick to one system.

Keith, you go farther than I go, I just write it down to the nearest 1/2
mm.

BUT, no matter what else I do on a mouthpiece, I first make a few
strokes of the table on 600 paper.  I then look at the marks left on
table of the mouthpiece.  Is it flat?  Is the sanded area even over the
whole table?  If not, the table is not flat.  You cannot measure
accurately with a warped table.

So, first order of business is to flatten the table.  Each time, before
you put the glass gauge on the mouthpiece, you must wipe the table
clean.  The slightest stray particle will throw off your measurements.
