Keith,
  I received #&#39;s 28 and 40 today in the mail - many thanks, again.

Any recommendations on what order to proceed? My inclination is;

1. Narrow rails from the outside to fit reed width.
2. Shape tip to reed curve.
3. Open throat and lower baffle.
4. Narrow rails from inside to proper width.
5. Apply facing curve.
6. Finish tip rail and baffle near tip.
7. Polish, plate, & play.

Reasonable game plan??

Keith L.

Depending on how much you open the piece up, you will need to repeat step 1
after step 5.  You could just wait and do it all of "1" after step 5.

Yeah, thanks Keith for all the work on the blanks. Cool stuff!! Got 
my 2 blanks Monday. Actually have a close to working mouthpiece now. 
Worked on it all last night.  Here is what I did:

1. made sure the table was fairly flat.  Lapped the table.
2. Rounded the tip to the reed contour. Be careful of the corner 
where the side rails, baffle and tip rail meet. Leave room for a tip 
rail.. I also narrowed the outside side rails at this point to fit 
the widest tenor reed I had. I was going to leave the side rails 
alone and not narrow the inside of the side rails.
3. Determine tip opening, generate a lay schedule using Keith&#39;s 
spreadsheet. I did my first one at 0.090" and 24mm.
4. Face the piece. I use to start from the window and work up to the 
tip, but I now work from the tip down to the window. I found that by 
working from the tip back, you do not overshoot the facing length as 
easily. Usually when I get the facing length correct, the 
measurements closest to the window also falls into place.
5. Finish the tip rail.
6. Baffle work. For this mouthpiece, I decided to take the second 
deck out of the bullet. I smoothed and rounded the bullet and lowered
the baffling close to the bullet.  I gently curved the baffle back up 
to the original height towards the tip. The chamber looks kind of 
like a Dukoff power chamber. Sanded the inside---baffle, bullet, bore.
7. Rounded and shaped the deck and beak. Lots of filing and sanding.
8. Polish outside. Man, I could not find my tripoli!?! I used red 
rouge, but it does not get some of the scratches out.  Will have to 
go and buy some tripoli to buff out the scratches.

OK, at this point, I wanted to put a reed on it and blow through it. 
I could not find a ligature small enough!!! I mostly have alto and 
tenor liguatures for rubber--too big. I was looking at the rovner 
site and they recommend a 1RVS for a Runyon Quantum...  I did not 
think about it and I did not try this yet. The 1RVS is a soprano 
rubber lig. I have a couple at home. Will try it when I get home. 
What I did was hold a reed up to the table and it does play, so I am 
encouraged. I&#39;m not a very good tip finisher, but this mouthpiece 
does pass the "pop test."

If the 1RVS fits, I will surely put it on a tenor and give a toot.

Good luck on your blanks!

Willis

            <pre class='message__body'>If the body of this mouthpiece is about the same diameter and taper as 
the Runyon metal mouthpieces, then a standard size soprano sax ligature 
will work.  I am using a Rovner 2M on my Runyon Quantum Tenor.
