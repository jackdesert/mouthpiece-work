            <pre class='message__body'>Hi guys, my name is Ernesto and I live in Argentina...

Could anyone share the measurements of an alto Claude Lakey 4*3 mouthpiece? factory dimensions?

I bought one in Roberto`s winds but does not sound right. Has no spontaneous emission, to make it sound I blow with excessive force. I test with different reeds (Vandoren V16 2 1/2 & 3 - Alexander Superial Classic 2 1/2 - Gonzalez Reeds 2 1/4 & 2 1/2)and ligatures and have a similar result.

I am studying for a year, and my teacher told me it was a good tip to start testing other sounds. Theoretically this mouthpiece should be right for a beginner like me and my teacher said me that is defective, he could not play with this mpc.

Thanks !!!

Ernesto

If your teacher says it is bad, return it and don't try to make it work. A
student needs better equipment than a professional.

supposed to be?

Hi guys, my name is Ernesto and I live in Argentina...

Could anyone share the measurements of an alto Claude Lakey 4*3 mouthpiece? 
factory dimensions?

I bought one in Roberto`s winds but does not sound right. Has 
no spontaneous emission, to make it sound I blow with excessive force. I test 
with different reeds (Vandoren V16 2 1/2 & 3 - Alexander Superial Classic 2 1/2 
- Gonzalez Reeds 2 1/4 & 2 1/2)and ligatures and have a similar result.

I am studying for a year, and my teacher told me it was a good tip to
