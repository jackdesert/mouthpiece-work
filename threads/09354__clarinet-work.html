            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;ve done a bit of work on sax mouthpieces and managed to get some reasonable results. I had a mess around with a clarinet piece, opening the chamber and putting in a baffle and found that the sort of things that work (internally) on sax pieces don&#39;t work so well on clarinets. 
I guess tip and rail may be similar but I&#39;m thinking more of chamber + baffles.

Any tips on how to approach clarinet work?

Also, any books on refacing apart from the Eric Brand/ Selmer manual?

 The problem to me seems to be the differing requirements of clarinet players. The legitimate player goes for the tone and a traditional mouthpiece with close facing, tapering sidewalls, narrow throat, and  low baffle all contributing to this.

On the other hand a Jazz player may want to escape from this tonal concept and brighten the tone with a raised baffle floor, more open tip for greater expression etc.

This approach certainly alters the tone and gives the clarinet a sound, somewhere between a legitimate clarinet and a soprano sax.
I like both but have always pursued the latter.

My own experiments suggest that a roll over baffle is ok. A wedge chokes off a free blow. The narrow chamber focuses the sound but an old Larsen that Berg made for me (60/0M) back in the fifties, has a long raised baffle floor with a slight hollow at the chamber end and a rounding of the chamber walls. It is a great Jazz piece if you have sax chops for it but not for a legitimate embouchure. 

I think some sax MPC design features will work on a clarinet MPC if not overdone.
Like you Steve, I wish to see more info on clarinet mouthpiece design, but it does not seem to be in the public domain.

..Eddie.

Thanks for the reply Eddie. 
I have a particular jazz fan who pursues the elusive "rich, dark tone", but as a jazz player he likes a wide tip opening. He uses a 5JB or sometimes B45lyre. 
I&#39;ve experimented opening up mouthpieces to make them darker and it seems to lose focus and not get particularly darker. 
The online info seems to vary. I&#39;ve looked at wide bore instruments which reportedly give a darker tone and narrower bore ones which spout the same virtues. 
From what I can gather the wider bores should give the tone he is after but I&#39;ve not found any mouthpiece options help particularly. 

I&#39;ve only ever dabbled in Mp refacing so it&#39;s all a bit of guesswork for me. I can get my tenor Link to play the way I want but clarinet pieces don&#39;t work tone-wise. I can open the tip etc but I can&#39;t figure out how to get the internals to respond.

...Large bore clarinets were the norm in the first half of the xx century and used by Shaw & Goodman who used legitimate or &#39;classic&#39; mouthpieces with short to medium lay lengths and tip openings around 46. I don&#39;t think today&#39;s players would accept anything less tone wise, even with the trend to smaller bores.

I have found that playing a classic MPC with very long lay and close tip & a suitably hard reed gives this traditional &#39;woody&#39; sound, an easy blow top to bottom, but little room for expression in any jazz style.
 If this is not the round sound you are describing, then I have found that medium/long lay coupled with an open tip gives a &#39;round&#39; sound. This is smooth and brings to mind players like Tony Scott, Pee Wee Russell & Bobby Gordon. I tried this for a time, but decide that articulation was too sluggish and intonation suffered unless masked by the use of vibrato. I think this is fine if you are a N.O./Dixie stylist. The 5JB & Rico Royal A7 would be in this category. The Rico has a large bore by the way. I am sure I have read somewhere, that you can use a large bore MPC on a smaller bore clarinet but not the reverse.
These are my own observations and not based on any superior knowledge.
