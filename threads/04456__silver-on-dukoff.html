            <pre class='message__body'>Hi,

Somebody have experienced to cover a Dukoff silverite with silver or
gold ? I love my mojo-dukoff and I was thinking to do it.

I would like to open here a discussion over "metal in the mouth", as
we absorbe it, and how is dangerous for healty. Many players stop to
use silverite or other metal mpcs using only surgical steel. Other
stop to use a mouthpiece when wear come out, and is visible the brass.
I well know how poisoned and dangerous are lead, nickel, asbestos,
even iron and alluminium can release.
What&#39;s your opinion?

And I&#39;d like to know if the brass is dangerous too when a mouthpiece
is scraped out in some point or is totally buffered as very brilliant
brass (maybe using a abrasive paste or a metal sponge). And what about
the copper?

Also, did you know how is made the metal mixed on Dukoff. The
"ingredient" are knowed or a secret? silverite sound like a
light-silver... or powder of silver... silver can have nickel mixed!
So... better a Martini mixed cocktail than a mixed poisoned Dukoff !

We can make a sure list of metals dangerous for healty and say:
do not touch with mouth.
...or better probably we can say surely which metals we can put on
mouth more than surgical steel (best for healty)

How many doctorplayer we have on this forum? or how many chemical
researcher in pharmacology?  Uhhhhhhh... hope many. Somebody know also
books or where to catch info about absorbing metal in the body?

Ciao. Gian
