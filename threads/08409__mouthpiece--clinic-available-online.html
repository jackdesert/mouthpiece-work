            <pre class='message__body'>Quite possibly……we haven’t decided yet……..Instructional DVD’s are a HUGE business for our company……..we’ll have to see how this one edits and what sort of magic my video guys can do by adding graphics…………if I don’t sell stuff, then I have to get a real job, and will have to quit doing clinics like this for no fee…….NAPBIRT even refused to pay my travel expenses after initially agreeing to do so……..I’m pretty sure some version of this will be on the market eventually, along with the supplemental written material…………our current mouthpiece refacing video (there’s a preview at www.nationofmusic.com) has sold much faster than our other two videos did initially, and we’re very happy about that.

 

Video is the natural format for teaching refacing. I would (and have) encourage anybody in the business who knows what they are doing and has something to teach to produce a video and share what they know. I don’t think anybody should be expected to go to the expense of producing a video (it’s not cheap) and not profit from it. I think it’s a very reasonable expectation to be able to make a living from your skills.


I didn’t release my rights to this to any third party, so the decision as to what to do with it is strictly up to Sharon and myself. We’ve got plenty of other projects and distractions right now, so a DVD of this clinic is not a high priority with us.

Quite possibly……we haven’t decided yet……..Instructional DVD’s are a HUGE business for our company……..we’ll have to see how this one edits and what sort of magic my video guys can do by adding graphics…………if I don’t sell stuff, then I have to get a real job, and will have to quit doing clinics like this for no fee…….NAPBIRT even refused to pay my travel expenses after initially agreeing to do so……..I’m pretty sure some version of this will be on the market eventually, along with the supplemental written material…………our current mouthpiece refacing video (there’s a preview at www.nationofmusic. com) has sold much faster than our other two videos did initially, and we’re very happy about that.
 
Video is the natural format for teaching refacing. I would (and have) encourage anybody in the business who knows what they are doing and has something to teach to produce a video and share what they know. I don’t think anybody should be expected to go to the expense of producing a video (it’s not cheap) and not profit from it. I think it’s a very reasonable expectation to be able to make a living from your skills.

I didn’t release my rights to this to any third party, so the decision as to what to do with it is strictly up to Sharon and myself. We’ve got plenty of other projects and distractions right now, so a DVD of this clinic is not a high priority with us.

Will this DVD be marketed and sold like your other repair DVDs?

Videotaping a NAPBIRT Clinic and distributing it for personal profit could be a first, if you decide to go that route.  I know that videos of many of the best NAPBIRT clinics are on the NAPBIRT website and made available for free to their members which is their usual custom.

            <pre class='message__body'>1. Yes, the pretty fonts have some characters look pretty odd. I hope he has a space in the busy schedule to address the glitch it soon.

2. If Mr. Goodson, Mr. Coats, or Mojo had the time to give me a private lesson on mouthpiece facing, (a slim chance with this many people), my gas money to Orleans, NE or a plane ticket to New Orleans, LA would cost as much as the mouthpiece video.  And I would expect to pay for other music lessons. So I have NO problem paying for a video IF the info is accurate and helpful. The info on this and the sax repair forums is often very valuable, but only makes them money if you do business with them.

If Napbirt has free videos as a membership benefit, good for them too.

            <pre class='message__body'>I’ve gone NAPBIRT one better by posting my clinic on the net, available to ANYONE, not just members of a given organization. It will be taken down soon, but the clinic in its entirety has been up for all to see at no cost. You don’t have to join any club or pay anything to see it. I have, since 1995, shared a HUGE amount of information on the internet at no cost to the saxophone community, which is my custom. I think I’ve put up more “free stuff” than just about anybody. NAPBIRT should consider putting up information available to everyone, not just their paying members.  I fail to see the problem here. My accountant, doctor, lawyer, mechanic, and many others all charge for their time and advice, which is how they make a living. I don’t see any difference.

 

I don’t have any trouble reading my posts. They look exactly the same after they are posted as they do when I compose them. I use the latest edition of Microsoft Office Outlook and have no problem. I’d say the problem is on your end. Get Microsoft Office and let me know if you still have a problem.

Steve. Are you aware of how garbled all of your posts appear on this forum? They look the same with Mozilla, Netscape, MSN, and Explorer. I&#39;m sure that someone with your vast internet experience could come up with a solution to this ongoing problem. 

Videotaping a NAPBIRT Clinic and distributing it for personal profit could be a first, if you decide to go that route. I know that videos of many of the best NAPBIRT clinics are on the NAPBIRT website and made available for free to their members which is their usual custom.

Quite possibly……we haven’t decided yet……..Instructional DVD’s are a HUGE business for our company……..we’ll have to see how this one edits and what sort of magic my video guys can do by adding graphics…………if I don’t sell stuff, then I have to get a real job, and will have to quit doing clinics like this for no fee…….NAPBIRT even refused to pay my travel expenses after initially agreeing to do so……..I’m pretty sure some version of this will be on the market eventually, along with the supplemental written material…………our current mouthpiece refacing video (there’s a preview at www.nationofmusic. &lt;http://www.nationofmusic.com/>  com) has sold much faster than our other two videos did initially, and we’re very happy about that.

 

Video is the natural format for teaching refacing. I would (and have) encourage anybody in the business who knows what they are doing and has something to teach to produce a video and share what they know. I don’t think anybody should be expected to go to the expense of producing a video (it’s not cheap) and not profit from it. I think it’s a very reasonable expectation to be able to make a living from your skills.


I didn’t release my rights to this to any third party, so the decision as to what to do with it is strictly up to Sharon and myself. We’ve got plenty of other projects and distractions right now, so a DVD of this clinic is not a high priority with us.

Iâd say the problem is on your end. Get Microsoft Office and let
me know if you still have a problem.

            <pre class='message__body'>Steve, there are a lot of folks (like me) that have multiple computers or simply do not want messages to come to them but want to read them when convenient, so they read these messages using the forum web pages.  Your messages appear with these special extra characters on the web pages.  

It&#39;s not a big deal to me, because you actually know how to speak and type, so it&#39;s easy to ignore these extra bits.  But it is a little difficult to read your messages on the web sometimes.  

My advice, and I&#39;m speaking as both a music professional and an IT professional here, is to get a Mac ;)  Microsoft has a long history of creating bass-ackwards ways of doing things, mostly in a (usually) futile attempt to confound their competitors, usually the ones offering low cost or free software.  Much as they want to be, they are not the standard bearers of Internet technology, and they often create non-standard extensions so that people are "locked in" to their software and operating systems.  I use Outlook because I have to at work, but it is in my opinion a piece of junk as an email client and RSS reader.

  Here is what I am tracking down. The problem seems to be how they appear on the web. If you receive individual emails, they may be fine. I’ll try to replicate the glitch later, I’m almost late for a gig now.

    I don’t have any trouble reading my posts. They look exactly the same after they are posted as they do when I compose them. I use the latest edition of Microsoft Office Outlook and have no problem. I’d say the problem is on your end. Get Microsoft Office and let me know if you still have a problem.

This is a test to see if I can replicate the glitch. I want to see which fonts work well in the transition from email to web posts and back. As some of you may see, my earlier note came with goofy ‘apostrophes’ as well. 

 

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Arial regular 12 Black

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Times new Roman Blue 12

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Times new Roman black 12

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Mystic Condensed Italic 14Red

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Luciano Bold Outline 16

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Vagabond Regular Green

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Beach Extended Bold 12

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Book antique italic dark yellow

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Veranda Regular 14 custom Orange

How! Oh how, does this font “look”? Gaze underline normal 16

 

Thank you for your patience in this matter!
