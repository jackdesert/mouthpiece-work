Is there an on-line dimensional reference for Saxophone and Clarinet
mouthpieces - extact reed dimensions, overall typical sizes, tenon or bore
sizing?

Would be useful to have it to consult!

Thanks,


Steve

            <pre class='message__body'>As for "exact" reed strength, if there is a recommendation, it is often a
range.  Vandoren recomends a range of 3 strengths for their mouthpieces
(presumably Vandoren reeds, since there is not a strength standard either).
 See their web site or the pamphlet that comes with their mouthpieces.  But
I recall using a harder reed than was in the recommended range for a
Vandoren 5JB when I was playing on one.  So it is just a guide.

Some makers will tell you what they use to test their mouthpieces with. 
But your chops are not their chops.

You can always ask on this and other forums what people are using.

If you have a specific dimensional question, ask it.  Several of us keep a
notebook of measurements or could grab a mouthpiece or instrument and make
the requested dimension.

We can build dimension databases as part of this forum.  But it is
difficult to structure one for all needs.

            <pre class='message__body'>I know for a fact that the width of contrabass reeds was changed due to
a large diameter cane shortage.

At one time the very wide contrabass sax, bass sax reeds were
available.  But the reed makers could no longer get the large diameter
cane to make those sizes.  So, in order to use the narrower reeds that
were available, the manufactuers called up the mouthpiece makers, and
asked that the facing be made narrower to accomodate the narrower reed.

I also had noted, years ago, that bass clarinet reeds interchanged with
tenor sax reeds, alto clarinet with alto sax reeds, etc., but for butt
length.  However, I saw that soprano sax reeds were very slightly wider
than clarinet reeds... but not enough to prevent using soprano sax reeds
on clarinet or vice-versa.

So, I asked Santy Runyon, and people in the reed business, is there a
correct size for each instrument?  Are there standards?  Who would make
such standards?  Well, the answer is, no.

            <pre class='message__body'>I find it interesting what you said about the sizes of clarinet and 
sax reeds. I used to use a Wolfe Tayne 8* Tenor mouthpiece on an alto 
(it was just narrow enough to get an alto reed to work properly, and 
the tenor reed actually overlaps the sides by a reasonable distance). 
And at one point in time, on this set-up I was using Vandoren 3.5 
alto clarinet reeds on this mouthpiece (on the alto).

ie:

Alto clarinet reed on a tenor sax mouthpiece on an alto sax...

I&#39;m not aware of any intonation problems, etc being there, but the 
mouthpiece did completely cover the cork (ie: you couldn&#39;t see the 
cork at all) when I tuned it.

Also, I concurr that the reed manufacturers seem not to have any 
standards. Both myself and a friend have found that there is a *very* 
large variation in reed strength for the same "sized" reed in the 
same "model" and brand - so you certainly can&#39;t compare brands using 
the same numbers. As an example:

Vandoren Java Tenor Sax 3.5 is about equivalent of Vandoren Classique 
3.25 (if it were to exist). However, I&#39;ve also found Vandoren 
Classique 3 reeds that would be the equivalent of a Vandoren 
Classique 3.5 or 4.
Rico Royal reeds are reported by some people to be softer than the 
same number Rico (standard) reed, but they&#39;re reported to be harder 
by others. Also, I&#39;ve come across Rico&#39;s and RR&#39;s that should be 
classified as much as 0.5, and even 1 reed strength harder and softer 
than they actually were on the box. My friend has had Rico&#39;s that 
have been classified as 3.5, but were as soft as a 2, or even as soft 
as a 1.5.
From a chart I&#39;ve seen, a La Voz hard is supposedly the equivalent of 
a Rico Royal 5, or a Vandoren Classique 4, but I found them to be 
softer than the VD 3 - more like a RR 3.5. Also, these tend to vary 
between being about the equivalent of a RR 3.5 and a RR 4 or evern a 
RR 5.
Alexander Superial reeds seem to be the least variable from what I 
can tell, but I haven&#39;t tried them myself, so I&#39;m only going on what 
friends have said. However, it would seem that they are somewhere in 
between the hardness of a Rico and a Vandoren for the same strength 
number.

From the info above, I think it&#39;s safe to say that most of the reed 
manufacturers can&#39;t seem to get their strengths consistent from batch 
to batch, and even within the same box, so I doubt that they&#39;re ever 
going to standardise on any strength numbering system between the 
whole lot of them.

If anyone else has anything else to add, please do.

The effective strength of a reed seems to be influenced by their 
physical history (how they were stored, prepared, and played), the 
player (embouchure and breath support), and the characteristics of 
the mouthpiece (tip openig, facing, and chamber profile). I have been 
keeping records of reeds and mouthpieces and have found a few cases 
where a Brand A reed of strenght x plays harder than a Brand B reed

I second everything you&#39;ve said there. I&#39;ve come to the point where
I&#39;m seriously considering buying reeds that are far too hard for me
(like Rico 5 or similar), and sanding their undersurfaces until I can
then play them. At least then I&#39;ll know that if they end up too soft,
it&#39;s my own fault.

At the moment, myself and a couple of friends are getting all sorts
of things - Rico 3.5&#39;s that feel like Rico 1.5&#39;s, Rico 3.5&#39;s that

  I have been 
  keeping records of reeds and mouthpieces and have found a few cases 
  where a Brand A reed of strenght x plays harder than a Brand B reed 
  of strength y on one mouthpiece and softer on another.

  Gregg

  I would guess that this is influenced by the length and shape of the facing curve.

            <pre class='message__body'>Drilling reeds in this fashion seems to free up the reed to vibrate
better.  Charpin brand reeds were made in this fashion.  I have also
seen reeds in the past with a groove filed in this area.

            <pre class='message__body'>Danny, down in the "links" section of the Reed Drilling page Bootman 
mentioned, there are several links to diagrams that describe how to tweak 
reeds to achieve specific results.

I maintain that page, btw.  I slapped it together about a year ago, with

            <pre class='message__body'>Got caught myself only last week on a box of Zonda&#39;s. They come out 
far harder than the Superials and LaVoz&#39;s I&#39;ve been using. Still, 
once you learn to sand reeds, it&#39;s surprising how you can tweak the 
performance around to suit you, and make a dull reed sound good.

            <pre class='message__body'>I agree. Has anyone measured reed profiles that way that some folks

mouthpiece facing curves to reed facing curves.

This might explain why some reeds play better on some mouthpieces

            <pre class='message__body'>It has defintiely been my experience that some mpcs are reed picky, others
play with almost any reed. The thing is to find which mpc plays best with
which brand of reed. Lawtons tend to like La Voz.

Danny, down in the "links" section of the Reed Drilling page Bootman
mentioned, there are several links to diagrams that describe how to tweak
reeds to achieve specific results.

I maintain that page, btw.  I slapped it together about a year ago, with
Bootman&#39;s permission.

Would you say there is any "general" guideline to matching reed cuts to 
mouthpieces.

For example, is it a reasonable assumption to say that a mpc with a short 
facing curve will favor reeds with a shorter vamp cut?

            <pre class='message__body'>I&#39;d say a long facing curve needs a long reed cut (or some scraping or a
hole drilled).  A short facing could probably work with a long or short
reed cut depending on how the cut tapers.

            <pre class='message__body'>That I just don&#39;t know.  It depends on what the player is looking for, and how a particular reed acts on a particular facing.

One thing I have seen... two different mouthpieces with identical facing... but the baffle is shaped differently.  And with the exact
same reed, one felt like it was a smaller tip opening, and had less resistance.  You could barely see a difference in the baffle
contour, yet there was a big difference in playing.

            <pre class='message__body'>Yes, thanks for that. I have a copy of the book from which the most 
common diagram seems to have come from. The only thing is that the 
main problem that is being experienced down here is that of a reed 
being too soft. Unfortunately, the only reed cutter that I&#39;ve managed 
to get a price for was far more expensive than I can afford, so I 
have to make do with them being too soft at times (or go hard, and 
soften them myself).

Thanks all the same.

            <pre class='message__body'>I think you&#39;ve hit the spot there. Also, it is likely to depend on 
the player too. Personally, I seem to need a reed with a slightly 
thinner heart, and thicker tip, so that the reed curves around the 
facing properly (and relatively easily - otherwise my high G and G# 
tend to underblow, and sound awful, or my chops end up like minced 
meat), while still being fairly hard, so that I don&#39;t sound too 
buzzy. But I&#39;m not about to start going to that level of modification 
to reeds just yet (I&#39;m likely to stuff things up more than fix 
them)...

            <pre class='message__body'>The groove is across the reed I assume...(???)

I suppose if it&#39;s a good groove, I&#39;ll end up more likely to be in 
a "good groove"...
