            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Discussion &quot;Subject&quot;</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>I like seeing the lively discussion, but let&#39;s try to title the 
Subject line to be appropriate.  The recent "Material" discussion is 
not really about a Gregory Mouthpiece.

This will help us find old discussions easier.  I&#39;m not so sure the 
Yahoo search feature is all that good.  I recently went looking for 
an old post about RIA mouthpieces and the search did not have any 
decent hits.  I ended up scanning all the subject lines until I found 
it.  Good thing "RIA" was in the subject line.

I do not have the rights to edit posts, only delete them.  So I need 
all your help on this.  Thanks.
