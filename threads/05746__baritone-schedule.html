            <pre class='message__body'>I was wondering if someone better with tables and spread sheets could 
check this out.  Im having a blonde moment.  I computed this curve 
with the Bari spread sheet.  Im wondering if this is a good 
approach.  Ive much less experience on Bari pieces.



R	5.8
M	57.0

F [inch]	L
0	57.0
0.0015	50.3
0.010	39.7
0.016	35.1
0.024	30.2
0.035	24.7
0.050	18.4
0.063	13.7
0.078	8.8
0.093	4.4
0.109	0.1



Thanks in advance.  If this isnt suggested Id love to have a good 
general radius schedule for a .105 and a .110

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>That was supposed to be for a .110 opening.  Sorry.

            <pre class='message__body'>Sorry I could not review it sooner.  This looks like a fine curve for a
.110" tip bari.  That is it will measure .110" at the very tip, but more
like .105" inside the tip rail.

            <pre class='message__body'>Interesting.  I&#39;m thinking about doing a little cleanup work on a modern
Otto Link Tone Edge 7*, also with an opening at the tip rail of .110, whose
original curve looks like this:

.0015 - 58
.005 - 51
.010 - 46
.016 - 40
.024 - 33
.035 - 28
.050 - 22/21 (left side/right side)
.063 - 17/16
.078 - 11/10.5
.093 - 6.5/6 

Good playing piece as is, but wildly different curve from the one just
suggested, with a much longer facing length.  My initial thought was to take
a little of the hump out in the .024 to .035 range.  Anyone care to speak to
how this curve ought to behave differently from the one being discussed here?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thats a pretty darned long facing length.  A big flat area on the 
vamp seems to me like it would gather spittle nicely.

Keith has a nice excel table in the baritone schedule that helped 
me.  I wasnt spot on but I was close.  Most folks dont recommend a 
Bari facig longer than 52.  My guess is that if it plays well its 
beacuse the lig is being clamped down and thusly warping the reed to 
accomidate the piece.

Just one thought.
