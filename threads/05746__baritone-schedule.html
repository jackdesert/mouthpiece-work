Thanks in advance.  If this isnt suggested Id love to have a good 
general radius schedule for a .105 and a .110

Thanks

            <pre class='message__body'>Interesting.  I&#39;m thinking about doing a little cleanup work on a modern
Otto Link Tone Edge 7*, also with an opening at the tip rail of .110, whose
original curve looks like this:

.0015 - 58
.005 - 51
.010 - 46
.016 - 40
.024 - 33
.035 - 28
.050 - 22/21 (left side/right side)
.063 - 17/16
.078 - 11/10.5
.093 - 6.5/6 

Good playing piece as is, but wildly different curve from the one just
suggested, with a much longer facing length.  My initial thought was to take
a little of the hump out in the .024 to .035 range.  Anyone care to speak to
how this curve ought to behave differently from the one being discussed here?

            <pre class='message__body'>Thats a pretty darned long facing length.  A big flat area on the 
vamp seems to me like it would gather spittle nicely.

Keith has a nice excel table in the baritone schedule that helped 
me.  I wasnt spot on but I was close.  Most folks dont recommend a 
Bari facig longer than 52.  My guess is that if it plays well its 
beacuse the lig is being clamped down and thusly warping the reed to 
accomidate the piece.

Just one thought.
