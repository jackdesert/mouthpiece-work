            <pre class='message__body'>My guess is that they are just a gimmick. There would be some change acoustically, though, since the fluting would increase the surface area of the walls and thus actually add to acoustic losses in the mpc through the boundary layer effect (where air molecules close to the walls are slowed down and lose energy to the walls). The goal is to have the smoothest walls possible, at least in terms of acoustic efficiency. If you want to work harder for less then the fluting would be for you ;-)

  Do the raised tracks or flutes inside the vintage Dukoff FLUTED hard 
  rubber mouthpiece floor and chamber as well as the Sugal mini-tracks 
  really serve any acoustical purpose or are these just a gimmick?
