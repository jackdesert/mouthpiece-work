            <pre class='message__body'>I am re-laying a clarinet &#39;piece using the 2445 curve in the files
section. 
This is unresponsive in the high register. 
I do not wish to increase the tip opening. Will altering the curve or
adding a flat section have any effect ?
If so, how much and where exactly should this be applied.
KWB says flats are good on clarinet. 
The Vandoren J5B & Selmer HS** in
the files section are good examples of manufacturing defects or wisdom
beyond my comprehension.
 I would try the HS** lay but have yet to
figure out how to apply such a facing to the mouthpiece.  :(

            <pre class='message__body'>Be aware that I have worked on less than 10 clarinet mouthpieces.  I have
reported my limited experiance, but it is limited.

If you are not getting good results applying facings that have been donated
to the site, try cloning a mouthpiece you own that plays well for you.
